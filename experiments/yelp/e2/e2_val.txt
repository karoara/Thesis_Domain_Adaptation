1	i got the oysters , i did n't think anything was wrong with them , but my friend did . i ate about 8 of them and felt fine . i also had their crab ... . $ 26 for a lb of crab , already sliced down the middle so no having to crack anything ... so good !	1255
1	i try not to eat fast food as much anymore but i love this taco bell . they are the best one i 've been to in the valley . much better than the one on blue diamond that seems to always be ten times more greasy . do n't get me wrong i have had a few minor hiccups here and there but overall this is a pretty good fast food restaurant .	859
0	not one but two things wrong with my dresser and they think that i should pay to return it , this is bull crap ! ! !	2071
0	friend and i bought popcorn for our wives . popcorn was old and was poor tasting . very disappointed in lack of quality . demand to taste it first from the bin it is being pulled from .	479
1	the view is the best in the city . rooftop has a neat pool . posh and chique . great venue for special events also . 4.25/5 *	3877
0	drinks are a rip off . five of my girlfriends and i ordered about 4 drinks each and could n't taste the alcohol . i never really drink so when i 'm anywhere else i normally have 2 and a fun time but this place was dirty and the floors where super sticky . not a fun place to spend a friday night .	1734
0	came to arizona and purchased a groupon for my nails . i did by mistake forget to make an appointment but expressed i was leave 2 days later . i was more then willing to make an appointment for a day while i was here but then i was told they already reached their groupon limit and could n't take me until after i was going to be leaving for home . groupon was great and refunded my money but that 's horrible customer service . i would have come back but they were unwilling to work with their customers .	1288
1	bacon and cheddar cheese breakfast sandwich yum ! ! staff is friendly and got my order in a timely manner	1214
1	i had the pleasure of being serviced by kelli and my wife by tasha . they were both amazing , extremely personable and by far one of the most ultimate , relaxing and fun experience we 've had at a nail salon . we will be back ! ! !	1370
0	it was ok , went to get my lashes done , and the employee 's were done talking another employee . i just thought that was unprofessional to do in front of a client , when it was time to pay she asked if i wanted to add tip , i told her i would tip her with cash , and then i could hear her like mumbling something under her breath , which again i thought was pretty rude and unprofessional . it was what it was but i wo n't be back . definitely need to work on customer service skills .	3614
1	i got in and out quickly , no hassle but they made sure i walked out with what i needed . good value for the price .	1640
0	do not go here ! i waited 25 minutes for a pedicure and they did a horrible job ! ! ! save your money ! go some place else . they are rude , the massage on my pedicure lasted all of about 30 seconds . the tools were not cleaned and she put no salts in my water .	3905
1	it is open 24/7 and the price is good . you can go with your own group , or go by yourself and join a team at the arena . the terrain has resonable challenges . remember to bring your dirty shoes , and wear clothes that you wo n't care about getting dirty . also , players are welcome to bring their own equipment .	2926
0	what a crappy dishonest place ! ! ! do not buy anything from this store . we bought a few pieces of furniture , 1 came broken and another chipped a few days after receiving it and continues to chip . we have been lied to by all sources and have been given the run around 4 different times . i would never recommend this store to anyone ! 1 star is too high !	1442
1	this salon came recommended by a few people so i gave them a try today for a gel manicure and i 'm pretty happy with the results . the salon is clean , staff is friendly and chats with you a bit , and they take their time instead of rushing your appt . to get to the next person . they also have great , competitive prices and tons of color options . happy to have found a good nail place !	2057
0	let me start off by saying this review is more for the service than the food . when i went in , everyone had a poker face on . they looked like they did not wan na be there . i can understand it 's a friday afternoon and you wan na go home and hang with ur friends , but hey , who does n't ? i ordered something to go , they did n't even bother waiting for me to pick it up , instead they put the order on the counter and walked away . some service there ! for all i know that could someone else 's order . thank goodness there was only me waiting . would not back again .	566
0	i 've been by that place a million times and never stopped . so about a month ago my fiance and i went there . all i can say is that place is nasty . never never again . i just do n't see how a place like that stays open . completely disgusting .	1212
1	looking back now that my son is almost 1 i must say thank you jc penny portraits team . they always called me , took time to work with my baby although i was n't happy few times it was n't their fault . babies do n't just pose for pictures on command . one time i passed buy to pick up my order and lisa suggested a sitting and my son was in a good mood so we did a bath tub session that is beyond cute ! ! ! with yellow rubber duck ! ! ! she took the time and was patient so thank you guys . keep up the good work and create long lasting memories for us .	223
1	this was our first time venturing out to antique malls . we very much enjoyed our day and this was the best spot ! very nice mall , easy to shop and friendly staff . we will have to return on cooler day to visit their outdoor space . we had a nice cold drink and snack in their restaurant .	1563
1	seated at 7:30 on a sunday evening without waiting for a table . stuck to my main course which was the 12oz filet and added sautéed button mushrooms to complement the steak which worked perfectly . awesome steak ! ended the meal with the cheesecake which was pretty tasty . i highly recommend pj clarke 's for all .	1538
0	i love this store , i shop there all the time ... they have great stuff ... ..but ... . the customer service sucks , there are a few employees that do n't mind helping you but then there are some that hate being there.. i 've been waiting in line to pay along with a bunch of other people and the mrg karen is walking around with her thumb up her a $ $ and wo n't open more registers.. the wait time is terrible ! ! jeez	204
0	this location held my health hostage by claiming i owed an outstanding balance from services rendered in 2011 . they would not draw my blood until this invoice was paid . funny ... i always pay my invoices immediately and have been to multiple sonoraquest locations since 2011 and no one has ever mentioned it before . disgusted with sonoraquest at the moment . the phlebotomist was a really nice guy , but mama june at the front desk fleeced me for a made-up charge . labcorp just gained a customer .	2195
1	it 's been several years since i went to this theatre . this location was not over crowded , and was much cleaner than my usual red rock theatre choice .	2450
0	after the car is washed , their car washers need to advise customers if there was any exterior area of their car that caused them concern about cleaning ( and therefore did n't clean it ) . rude and unprofessional responses by owner , peter , addressing this and without an apology .	2579
1	great hotel and great location ! not too far from carowinds . and the location has a nice little area to walk around and places to eat without having to drive . surrounding restaurants are within walking distance .	3289
1	i 've used lodi door on several occasions and have been more than satisfied with their service and professionalism . would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone .	3931
1	excellent salon ! clean , kind , efficient ! my nails never lift , pedicures are relaxing and amazing !	2083
0	i had some shorts taken in with annie and had to go back , because they were n't taken in enough ... she argued with me for several minutes about how they were fine , but i insisted she take them in more . she told me they would be two weeks , so i waited . when i finally picked them up she was as smug as can be ( in front of another customer , mind you ) . she actually took the shorts in just enough to make them uncomfortable and basically unwearable . i 'm pretty sure she did it on purpose . i have n't been back since .	3401
0	if my excellent gp did n't practice here i would not consider going here . when i initially began coming here 3 years ago they had excellent customer service . things have rapidly gone downhill . poor customer service and standard long wait past appointment time regardless of day of the week or time of day . surly back office staff update april 3 rd here for my annual check up been waiting 40 mins past my appointment time . same story no one tracks how long schedules patients are waiting . never informed if your doctor is running late or how long the wait is . please do n't bother coming here . my doctor is awesome but this clinic is horrible !	297
1	these guys are awesome - they have fixed multiple amps for me and they have always delivered on time and on budget . hands down the best place to get your audio stuff fixed ! !	3693
0	unfortunately , things are n't getting much better here . water is indeed shut off at least once a week or there are days when it 's lukewarm . i have very loud inconsiderate foreign student neighbors who think it 's okay to scream at their video games at 3 am ( little emperor syndrome ) . the walls here are thin enough that you hear every little thing . i try to be considerate , but between the dog poop , broken washing machines , murky pools , random fights ( drunks and dogs ) and odd smells , it 's getting to be too much . oh , i also forgot to mention the door slammers and chain smokers .	2492
1	so i recently went in with a pretty bad ingrown toenail . pac julie was terrific ! she was so kind and gentle ! made my visit way better than i expected ! definitely recommend her if you ever have an ingrown .	2580
1	good pizza , not the best that i 've eaten . personally i love a good pizza , woodland definitely satisfies that craving . although i would not put it up there with the best pizza that i have eaten , it 's probably in my top 5 . in you live in the verdun/ile-des-soeurs area you have to make this your go to pizza place because there is none better .	411
0	this food was seriously wrong , it did not seem fresh ... almost like it was spoiled . the pancake was frozen for sure and the eggs made me nauseous ... my friend 's omelette was not fresh either . i dont know if its only our food or the day but i will never go again . if you like some hotel 's breakfast like the free ones that are frozen , then you might like this .	243
0	boycott this shop ! sure , there 's some good ( if over-priced ) stuff ... ... but the amount of plastic here makes the metro downstairs look eco-friendly ! the world is drowning in plastic , , , ,these people are making it much worse . come on ... it 's 2018 -- time to wake up a bit , no ? à boycotter ! ! ! ! !	3586
1	i absolutely love this place . i have going there for literally ten years and never once had a bad experience ! they are friendly , helpful , fast & fun . they try to know all of their clients by name and will always make time to see everyone who walks in the door in a timely manner ! definitely my go to nail spot .	1099
1	lived here for 2 years and loved it ! amenities are 24/7 . gym is great , lots of free weights . the pool & hot tub is my favorite . the hot tub has a fire fit that is amazing to sit by in the evening . also one las vegas is the only high rise where all your utilities are included . you only pay power . cable & internet are included . amazing deal ! love the location . love to park my own car . only negative is they could use a bit more parking .	3264
0	this was my first time getting physical therapy ( shoulder injury ) , so maybe my expectations are n't on target . you get a set of instructions the first day and that 's pretty much it . from then on , it 's basically a gym membership . i did not have anyone helping me with my form , giving me new/different exercises , etc . the only part that was amazing was the stretching at the end that is performed by the pt . that was the only reason i kept going , otherwise i could have done it all at home .	2755
0	i definitely got ripped off by these guys . i was charged $ 400 to cut out a plastic line and cap it . he did n't even run a new line to the fridge where the line was originally run to . it took the technician 10 minutes to do and he used maybe $ 5 in parts . i was even told that i was getting `` a good deal '' . never again .	2614
0	very slow service . i think this is supposed to be `` quick '' dining ... relative to a typical sit down . i ordered to-go , and i was there for 25 minutes . food was somehow cold by the time i got it ? anyways , food was ok . probably wo n't ever go back , because of service . you want something quick , pop over to blaze pizza right next door .	712
0	overall food wasnt half bad , my major issue was so -called hostess chasing our car down the street because we had the nerve to use gift certificate to pay for our order , never have i been treated so poorly , my only advice if you decide to go is bring cash and lots of it	878
0	do not buy anything refurbished from this store ! ! the manager is a fool who sells people refurbished consoles that do not work after 30 days . we had a 30-day warranty but after the thirty days had passed and the wii stopped working , they refused to exchange it or have it fixed . or do anything about the inconvenience that they caused .	3027
0	we booked a couples spa package at this salon even though we were staying at the mirage . in hindsight , i wished we did it at the mirage instead . the roman theme was nice enough . the spa facilities were ok. had all the amenities and the idea of pampering , large sauna , steam room , showers , herbal shampoos , etc . however , i felt they really rushed us with the massage . both the masseuses were a little on the snobby side and really did n't seem to like to be accommodating on pressure or problem areas .	3300
1	great fast service . our repair on our bench was perfect . definitely be back when needed .	1174
1	i just went there and was so totally impressed thst i hd to write a review the service the products totally off the chart !	433
1	went to vegas to celebrate my bday . the last night there i went to the quad to play a little ... .and the bartender named richard was soooo nice and chearful . made my night ... .he made some delicious drinks and kept them coming . even tho by the end of the night i lost my money i 'm glad i went there .	2976
0	been there twice to learn about their xbox and games . stood there for several minutes , no one acknowledged me , asked to help me , either time . but both times someone younger showed up and within seconds they were acknowledge and helped .	1006
1	please start selling eeggees like your location ahwatukee . i guarantee that all of us ex-tucsonans ( and there are a lot of us in chandler ) will flock to your pizzeria and will become loyal patrons very soon !	417
1	you may find some better places in the suburbs , but for the city area , this is one of the best places to get your nails done . clean , fast , good quality . this the go-to nail salon for me and my picky friends .	1817
1	very decently priced place . they did n't have shish tawook or chicken breast on their menu so i was forced to go to ali baba down the road for my fiance which was a disaster piece of food compared to wrap and grab 's chicken shawarma . i 've been here a few times they are pretty good in timeliness and service and their food is above average as well . i 've seen the same people working here over the one or two visits over 3 years .	775
1	a diamond in the rough . excellent selection of designer vintage dresses , ready to wear , shoes , hand bags and accessories ! outstanding guest service . my mother and i live in ohio , but i can guarantee you that we will continue doing business with robby and rachel ! i recommend this place without hesitation !	2002
0	average food except for the rather tired-looking and vintage flavoured edamame and rather limp and worryingly flavorless ginger . looks like they serve old food here . also , table was sticky . jazz music playing quietly - loved that . nice server and cook .	734
0	went there tuesday and wednesday of this week they seriously were so slow and there were 3 of them walking around doing nothing . one time i ordered an ice tea which they forgot about and the 2nd day i ordered a hot tea that they forgot about .	3143
1	being an expert on sushi and experienced sushi establishments around the globe i would have to believe my years of knowledge means something . my dining experience here was one of the best . the place is really classy and well lit and laid out well . the staff knowledgeable and friendly . my server danielle was both attentive and bubbly and added to my experience here . the sushi was fresh and presentation was top shelf . i normally do n't order desert but danielle was pretty convincing and i 'm glad she was . off the chart delicious . would highly recommend to my fellow sushi lovers . and when you do ask for danielles section as she adds to the dining experience .	602
1	in the short time that i have been seeing dr h. , i am already confident that he and his staff are truly trying to find the reason for my illnesses , and then a plan to deal with them ... not just a band aid . they did n't waste time ... they got the ball rolling on my very first visit . wish i had made the move to complete care medicine much sooner . btw , my daughter sees jenna , one of the practice 's pa and feels the same way . thanks ccm !	590
1	i will say the waxing here is great . they do a very professional job . not super cheap , but a thorough job .	228
1	ordered our daughter 's bridesmaids dresses here & arrived early . great staff & customer service . having the alterations done today . big thanks to the staff . very helpful & knowledgeable .	1298
1	decided to revisit this business did not spend enough quality time in from the other nights yelp event . plus this time i had my best bud . it is great to fly solo at this place , but with the games and all they have to offer it is better with two or three . it was a beer night so we drank bud light with shots of fireball and played old atari games and caught up on the latest gossip . we played the bowling type games and even watched beer pong such a great experience to lose yourself with beer .	2494
1	i had a great experience here . the associate manager , truiet , went out of his way to fix the windshield of my car due to faulty wipers . the dealership claimed that it was not their problem , but since the wipers were installed at service king , truiet decided to pay for an entirely new windshield out of his own pocket at no fault of their own . i did n't have to pay a single penny . did i mention that they installed it in less than 30 minutes the next day ( even though they had to order the parts ) .	1926
0	by far the worst doctor office i have ever encountered . the only good part about that office is the doctor dr. garcia . i will never go back there ever . their scam artist who bill you for things that you do n't even own . they make you wait 2 to 3 hours before you even see anyone . heed my warning never go there they are awful .	2461
0	from a delegation organizers standpoint , this hotel was very disappointing . after 3 negative experiences ( 1 in particular ) a kind staff member tried to repair the mistakes they had made . after leaving the hotel , i only got home to have numerous charges on my credit card that i had not authorized . would not recommend this place for large groups or event planners .	1859
0	been here for over 4 hours and still have n't seen a doctor . every time i or one of my family comes here i end up regretting it . they are always short staffed . it 's awful .	3131
0	fish was not fresh and sushi tasted horrible . also the chef/ owner refused to go or the yelp 10 % off for check in and said it 's only for pick up although the 10 % off is for checking in ! anyway , if you 're into sushi and sashimi you should stay away from this place : (	734
1	nice place for a nice breakfast- the staff can do better as far as service and interpersonal- i definitely recommend !	1276
1	came for my boyfriend 's birthday . the seafood was really good . we had the surprise seafood and i had shrimp risotto , they had a reaaaaally nice charred barbecue taste i loved it ! the wine recommended was amazing as well . our waiter was really nice too ! it was kinda difficult to eat not knowing where everything is but it was an interesting experience . the only downside was waiting over 30min for the main course , i was starving !	449
0	service was n't too friendly at first . seemed full of themselves and not much of a good inventory on used hondas . service was n't too friendly at first . seemed full of themselves and not much of a good inventory on used hondas .	2210
1	i am a fan of petsmart . got to know them very well in colorado , especially in arvada and westminster , there . very fair prices on premium dog and cat food , such as iams , and science diet . also , excellent prices on purina and all lower quality foods . clean store to shop in , and , this store especially has great pets for adoption , including dogs and cats in good health . friendly help , always . i 've never been disappointed shopping there . it 's in my 'neighborhood ' near where i live so it 's easy to reach . definitely , a place to shop again and again .	2108
0	such a small , crowded and loud place . i can not believe when i entered , the music was playing in my ears , i almost lost my hearing . and the drinks.. i got a drink for $ 13.50 . oh my god . my friend got 2 drinks for $ 25 . that is horrible , and really so many 20ish age people jumping around on your feet , no place to stand.. we left right away . there are better places for sure , do not waste time and money here .	2636
1	very prompt service and a stones throw from work and school , i think it 's the best spot in the area , if you do n't come here you are missing out !	3878
1	great place . visited in during winterlicious , very cozy and classy interior . food was delicious and creative menu . worth it , will definitely return .	621
1	located in terminal a , the only restaurant among fast food options ( near a12 ) . it was packed and it is self seating . once seat found i was immediately greeted and drink order taken . i ordered the bbq pulled pork sandwich . in 5 mins i had my order . it had a smokey flavor ( not too much ) which was amazing . although i put bbq sauce on it , without it was tastey , it enhanced the taste . i would definitely come and order the same thing again if ever in this terminal .	1400
1	i had to replace a tire with a slow leak . i was in and out in 20 mins . i 've been here a couple times now and would n't hesitate in coming back again if the need arises . nice staff .	2542
1	love this place ! sometimes they have a little bit of a wait so it is best to call in advance to make an appointment . but overall my daughter and l love coming here and my nails always look phenomenal	2297
1	we had some issues in the past with the staff and wait times but this has improved greatly . we had no issue on last visit . that aside dr garcia is without a doubt one of the best pediatricians we 've ever been to . she is super confident and alway spot on with recommendations and treatments . we bounce between dr garcia and dr sirsy who is also an excellent pediatrician . we highly recommend dr garcia .	2461
0	if i could leave 0 stars i would . the woman who works here 's ( i 've only seen one ) sucks . she does n't listen to you no matter how detailed you tell her . she ca n't shape eyebrows or match them to save her life . i 'm currently bawling because i feel so unattractive with how shitty she shaped my eyebrows i asked for square . thick with a little arc and this is what i got . paper thin with uneven starts , extra hairs everywhere . save your money and time and heartache not coming here .	2986
0	i apparently did n't have the same experience as others . i went in to purchase gift certificates and was assist by an employee that must have been having a bad day . she appeared to be putting games away and seemed bothered with having to interrupt her work to help me . i 've always thought the customer should be the first concern . her unconcern bordered on rudeness , the party with me also commented on her lack of customer service . i asked her name before i left . it was nicky . perhaps some customer service training would be beneficial in this instance .	3530
0	awful ! floor was so dirty that my shoes almost came off due to sticky substance . also unruly teenagers have taken over this theater . it is no longer possible to enjoy a movie at this location . this location is merely a babysitting service for parents to drop off their entitled , disrespectful brats . in turn , they ruin everyone else 's movie experience .	1240
0	the technician , james schmidt , inspected my house and i waited two weeks for his estimate before calling the office . the nice lady told me that james was in the office and would call me back after he finished with his call . i waited another week before calling back this morning . i finally spoke to james and he said they were unwilling to complete the job but it would cost $ 20,0000-25,0000 . this is two to three times higher than my other bids . horrible customer service ! if this is the way they treat potential customers , i would be scared to hire them .	2203
0	not impressed . i have been here a few times just to see if maybe it was the person i had . i would not recommend this place . the pedi was not impressive at all . i felt rushed and the quality was poor . i also feel it is not as clean as a nail place should be . disappointed .	120
1	how come the rating is so low ? ? ? how can you not love this bar ? ? ? ! ! ! they always have a great beer selection and awesome monthly drink specials . the new food truck menu is amazing ( reminds me of home ) and the shrimp and grits are to die for . seriously ! if i was on death row hickory tavern shrimp and grits would be my last meal .	201
0	having heard only good things , i had pretty high expectations for monty 's but i felt let down by the service and really let down by the food . the meals ordered , chicken in a pie and salmon cakes were both luke-warm and tasted like they had lived under a warming lamp for quite some time . this place it not worth the reputation .	975
0	i called to make a appointment and when i showed up they were telling me that they were all booked . i drove far to come here and waited time . horrible service would not recommend	3469
0	overdone and dry meats plus sides were n't available . the potatoe casserole tasted like plastic . staff was nice though .	966
1	been to quite a few different jersey mikes locations and this one is by far the best ! the guys working here tonight were fast , friendly and efficient . they loaded our sandwiches to the max which was nice ! pricey but definitely worth it !	1528
0	wish we knew the chinese garden was still shut down for renovation . it 's one of the main exhibits and you ca n't see much of it unless you 're peeking through a fence here and there . they also no longer have the large mossy sculptural exhibits anymore . like other reviewers said , there are n't clear signs so getting from one part of the garden to the next was a little frustrating . in terms of the flowers , there were some pretty sections , but it was overall underwhelming . the entrance was a little embarrassing . really sad , sparse looking flower beds . i would n't go back .	183
0	nothing is where it should be . milk . eggs . bread . frustrating . the giant eagle eggs do n't even have a bar code . at self-check , when i pressed the help button , instead of coming over to help me , the supervisor yelled out to me . being hearing impaired , i did n't hear her . she just yelled louder , and everyone looked at me like i was nuts . was an embarrassing and frustrating experience so i just walked out . i will not spend another dime with giant eagle . terrible layout . terrible , unempathetic service . hostile to anyone with a hearing impairment and way overpriced .	3430
1	i drive for uber and veyo . i drive 80 % of the time for veyo . cancellations are a real time killer . i 'm sitting here now because my 1st rider request was 33 miles away in south phoenix during rush hour . the second was because veyo set her pick up time too early . the third was a duplicate trip and i was second to arrive . i 've been on line for 3 hours and have yet to make a cent . it 's still better than uber .	1232
0	really good coffee , but the staff could n't care less about customers . service is minimal , food is ok. go there with low expectations	1035
1	kishyn and tavarie were my technicians . they were on time , respectful of my home and efficient . they answered questions and explained services . i was very pleased with the service and would use them again . please note that they charge a $ 35 fee to pay with an american express card . also , you are to call the office to pay for the service upon completion if they do n't explain it to you .	182
0	i was so excited to come here . i heard so much about this place . it took 2 hrs to get our food . i got the trio . not impressed . only liked one of them . the only reason they get one star is because of our waitress . i would love to give it a second shot , but let 's just say that after tonight , roy 's left a bad taste in my mouth . ok , giving one more star because the head chef came by and apologized . appreciate the gesture but still does not make it right .	1534
0	35 $ to develop one 24pictures 35mm film what a joke where do u guys send the film ? ? ? ?	2753
1	this nail spa is fantastic ! ! i 've been coming to this location for 4 years now and i 'm not going anywhere but here . the new owners and staff are amazing and know what customer service means ! the quality is the best i 've experienced here in vegas !	1333
0	paid for an escalade but got picked up by an old yukon . driver also talked on the phone while driving .	2952
0	horrible . halibut was the special . it was dry . rested in my stomach like rocks . their featured appetizers were deep fried . they were either over cooked or cooked in old oil . whatever the case , it was equally as horrible as the halibut . this was a second rate applebee 's meal at over the top prices . never coming back . their sister restaurants , salmon dave 's and blue point leave a lot to be desired as well . there 's better restaurants in cleveland do n't bother with this place	1168
1	we booked exotica limousine services for our wedding this past weekend through weddingful . the driver was friendly , the limousine itself was great ( 30 person `` party bus '' ) and timings were met . the only drawback was that the heater seemed either faulty or old because it took awhile for the bus to heat up ( despite it being about 5 degrees outside ) . overall , the interior was pretty sweet and everyone was comfortable . i would recommend them to other newlyweds !	2578
1	we 've been going to this no frills for years now and , in my opinion , it 's the best one in south etobicoke . it usually has all the items advertised in the circulars , good in-store specials , decent pharmacy , clean parking lot , carts and baskets are always available and the staff are very friend - typical of mimico though !	2276
0	first off parking for n event is a night mare . then its in a basement so forget about it being decent walking distance from hotel lobby .	587
0	friendly staff ? yes clean ? yes knowledgeable staff ? they did n't know how deep the pool was ( 4 or 6ft ) they could n't tell me why i do n't have access to the sauna . they could n't tell me what is included in my basic membership plan . machines ? seated leg press back rest was broken ( gyms opened 4 days ago ! ) update : second machine broken in just 1 week ! ! they just lost two stars . employee said he 'd take care of it . 45min later , nothing . hazard ! ! ! does n't anyone read these review this place is filthy ! ! !	1695
0	walked out of my appointment because i was misquoted the price for a eye exam ... i called they said it was $ 49 i get into the office said it 's $ 59 and this is after i spent a good 30 minutes filling out paperwork . i did n't feel comfortable and i do n't trust the guy behind the counter . go at your own risk	1345
0	will destroy your valuables and refuse to refund or compensate you . they shrunk 12 silk drapes 7 '' each - which cost over $ 2,000 brand new ! ! there are also holes in the drapes - first time ever being cleaned . they are unwilling to pay for any of the damages . beware of unscrupulous businesses like this ! this place lacks professionalism , integrity , and value of their customers . what a nightmare ! ! ! !	1719
1	i 've found such great deals here . make it a monthly gig as they get stuff in all the time so you do n't want to miss anything ! the contractors who they recommend there are great too ! you pay 10 % more of the prices listed but it 's still cheap ! ! ! ! products here are mainly high end !	3532
1	i had a great experience at the marks best buy . the staff was really friendly . they offered advice and good ways to save some money . they made sure i had everything i needed before i left . i will definitely come back to the store .	494
0	terrible ! ! ! i got 20 wings and no buffalo sauce and when i called they were very rude and told me there was sauce when i took everything out the bag there was none . the lady was extremely rude and they did nothing to correct this mistake . never ordering here again im livid . disgusting sauceless wings . not worth my 5 dollar tip	987
1	this was a beautiful hotel . its right in downtown toronto and overlooking the water . the room was modern and well designed . the bathroom was very tiny , but typical in a downtown city environment . the service at the hotel is great and the lounge is great to have a bite to eat and a drink . the restaurant inside the hotel is well appointed , but not as nice as the rest of the hote . the price for the breakfast buffett was crazy at $ 30. ! its probably better to just order what you want individually	1859
1	this is about the 5th or 6th time i 've been into the store this month . they 've had spectacular deals due to clearing out all the old stock for remodeling . while there were a few minor snags with a purchase , leah-ann the sales manager and her staff have made every reasonable attempt to make everything as perfect as possible . as far as the chairs , tables and loveseats we purchased , the quality is excellent even before the sale prices . thank you ashley furniture team ; we 'll be seeing you again real soon .	1794
0	this hotel would have been a 5 star hotel if it had not been for the overly confident owner . who does n't feel as if anything could ever go wrong . i started the conversation with what i enjoyed about the place . then started to let him know about what i was unsatisfied in this case a rude chain smoking late night receptionists . half way threw my sentence he interrupted me and started arguing with me ! i will never stay here ever again and will tell everybody how awful this hotel is .	3434
0	i 'm upgrading the star because of their prompt response to my concerns and attempts to win me back . i do appreciate good customer service : )	3591
0	i was very excited with my initial consultation , which was a year ago , 2012 . dr smith assured me that he would take care of my varicose veins , well , a year later and after several sclerotherapy treatments , and a lot of money out of pocket and insurance claims , my veins look and feel exactly the same ! ! the problem is that they mislead you , by making you think they are going to take care of the deeper issue , thrombosis but instead they inject your veins with that scherotherapy which is just to treat spider veins and does nothing else .	645
1	came to my home and buffed up my old porsche . looks good . plan to have him return for my other car .	2888
1	came in on a wednesday afternoon ro kill some time . i decided to have a bit to eat . had the long beach fish tacos . gluten free of course . there was a mistake when they came out not gluten free . my server was on top if it she got them to remake them . once i took my first bite i was in heaven . my fish was grilled perfectly and everything was super fresh . i will definitely be eating this again . i kinda want to order 10 for my home but do n't because i 'd rather come back to see the friendly staff and enjoy these environment .	1177
0	i have been coming here everyday after work for 5yrs . i order the same thing every day . these people never and i mean never get it right . and every weekend i 'm here order the same dam thing for 5yrs . never do they get it right . the owner / gm should do some recon instead of playing bigshot . wish i could add a picture of the ultimate meat and cheese burrito they just brought me . which had to push button again to get the salsa i asked for . bad management . ... ..	844
0	where do i begin ? first they get me confused with another patient and actually have the other patient 's records in my examining room for me to review , if i had n't brought it to their attention . when i call i ca n't get any information and , again , they frequently mix me up with someone else . one day they tell me my blood work is back and the next they say it is n't . getting a doctor to call back is near impossible . the staff is completely incompetent . i am contemplating reporting the frequent mess-ups ( major hipaa violations ) with the state . avoid this group at all costs .	513
0	i 'm torn with this place . ive been here twice before for after hours urgent care and the wait was minimal , like 10 mins . this is where they get 4 starts . that was great but today i have an appointment and have been waiting to go back for an hour now . it is a simple visit , just here to have a cast taken off . went to the desk to see when we would be called , and would n't you know it , we were next on the list to be called . ha . at least i had time to catch up on yelp reviews..	888
1	best customer service , honest and helpful ... . would recommend to my family and friends . will shop here again .	3495
1	this is our first time visiting bushes chicken , and let me start off with friendly staff , especially the asst manager shikura . the chicken looks tender and crispy , i 'm about to dig in ... will continue . the two chicken breast i had was delicious ...	862
0	one of the absolute worst experiances i 've ever had . my shellac peeled in 2 days , they butchered my cuticles and left my nails mishaped .	3247
0	do n't go in and expect to talk to the manager she is very rude and smart mouthed especially when your trying to get a job there	204
0	normally i like to give places the benefit of the doubt , but the brunch combo this place served is so ridiculously overpriced i feel i have to do something to warn others about it . the food was very mediocre , portions are tiny especially considering the price , and nothing i tasted felt interesting or creative . the `` persian tea '' i got tasted like normal black tea . maybe if i got a cup that was more than 2 tiny sips i could better judge the flavor	720
1	these guys just saved our ass ! we got stranded in peoria and made it to the shop with a broken serpentine pulley and they were able to fix it within a half an hour when all other places would not take us at 3 p.m. on a saturday . our car is an older mercedes and also we could not get a rental car , and we are on a road trip to mexico so they really saved our day and were really pleasant and i think the manager should get air conditioning in the garage for them ! ; - ) thanks guys ! have a great weekend !	2308
0	not sure what 's going on ? but the service was very bad . only one waitress and never around to take order . the drinks was weak and the creditcard was n't working . omg . we are in vegas inside a casino , and i ca n't believe that happened . anyway , she got lucky that i tip her $ 2 . avoid this place .	3343
1	normally do n't write reviews , but have to give a special shoutout to marion ( spelling ? ) for doing a great job . was really patient in working with me and was really nice .	1936
0	this gym has had an hvac issue for over a year . it is so bad that it becomes hard to breath while working out . a disgrace to the la fitness brand .	2314
1	come here every 2 & 1/2 weeks to get my gel nails . the staff is beyond friendly and they are fast and efficient . the salon is very clean , and they provide a wide range of nail polish colors . also this would be the best bang for your buck . you can make an appointment or you can walk in , very convenient .	1954
1	fishy fish market if you 're looking for fresh seafood , come no further than fishy fish market in charlotte , north carolina ! ! ! they have a wide assortment of fish that will blow your mind ! this is also the only place that i 've ever seen that sells sting ray wings ! ! ! totally wan na try next time ! prices are reasonable and they even cook it for you !	3310
0	had a great time in my first pop art your pet class ! so much so i bought myself and two friends seats in another popart your pet class ... . and then it was unexpectedly cancelled ... and despite many emails , phone calls and request through paypal to get my $ 120 back for our class ... i 'm out the money . severely annoyed and disappointed .	3048
0	the seats in the theater are uncomfortable and broken . they squeak and squeal if you even think about shifting your weight . also , the sound from the other theaters bleeds through really bad . i 'm currently hearing someone singing two theaters down , an ominous bass rumble in the next theater , and static/white noise from the speakers in the theater i 'm in . way subpar experience compared to harkins . it 's worth the drive to go to the harkins at az mills rather than coming to this crap hole for the 'convenience ' .	2406
0	came here to get my son 's haircut , walked in an stood there for 10 mins before i was even greeted . then someone finally walks up , well actually they were walking out of the salon and asks are you here for a haircut ? i said yes for my son and then they say something in spanish to another stylist and then says to me they have no one avail to cut hair . never suggests a time to come back or asks if i 'd like to schedule an appt for later or anything and then just walks out . first impression of this place was a bad impression and i wo n't be back..	3873
1	i drive by it all the time on my way to work so last friday i stopped in . the staff was super friendly which is a stark contrast from the fast food joints i usually get iced coffee from . i ordered a ham and cheese croissant combo , the price with an iced coffee was cheaper than any fast food place and the doughnut holes ! yummy ! it has that mom and pop feel and the staff was perky !	3137
0	never fly with this airline ! ever ! ! ! ! i arrived on time my flight was delayed from 8 pm to midnight but they had another flight leaving at 11 pm . i request i get on that flight they granted my request but made me pay more money . ridiculous . exact same story on the way home . horrible airline ! on a side note i got all of my money back by disputing my cc charge : ) . this airline still sucks though	1623
0	i can not yet comment on the quality of the food . i walked in ( first time ) at 3pm and inquired about slices . i was told they were out of slices . incredibly disappointing . honestly , it takes less than 10 minutes to make a pizza for additional slices . seems lazy to me . poor customer service . on a side note , i think that there pizza is incredibly overpriced , and the parking situation a bit shady . will update when i finally get to try a slice or two . as a former new yorker , i 'm always suspicious of pizza claiming to be ny style .	87
0	this place is as bad to be expected ! the monthly fee is decent , however the neighborhood not so much . also , every time i come here it smells of urine and on very rare occasions people will clean the machines . the manager and staff is incompetent and not very friendly .	2959
0	i can echo what ned p. said of this place . i had nearly the same experience . took my car there for an oil change and tire rotation and suddenly another $ 1600 in repairs came up . i ended up taking the car to my dealer to correct what this store did wrong . i could n't confirm it but the adviser at the dealer hinted that this store made mistakes on my car that ran the bill up .	1055
0	regal cinemas willoughby commons 16 certainly has n't improved when it comes to customer service . even though it was the heart of spring break last week , there were still never more than two ticket windows open with a line out the door . the lines at the concession stand were equally long . i spent 30 minutes in a ticket line and 20 minutes at concessions to see a 90 minute movie . just awful . as always no manager jumped in to help . nope , they walked around with their headsets or ran into their office . clearly the requirement for managing a regal cinema is a pulse and body temperature somewhere in the 90s .	2671
0	i smudged my polish on the way to vegas so i stopped here to get a polish change . she said the cost was $ 20 for toes and $ 15 for hands cash only . $ 35 to change the polish ! it costs $ 40 in my hotel spa but at least there i do n't have to question the sanitation of the place .	2686
1	my experience at coulter infiniti was exceptional . aaron is very very thorough and helpful , as soon as i pulled up , a greeter came to my door and was very polite and offered me a water while i waited to be seen . they have a comfortable , cool waiting area , with sodas , snacks , & a tv . all the details regarding the service & needs my vehicle has were summarized and explained thoroughly , and a summary report was given to me upon completion of the work . i felt as if they had my best interest in mind , & upon completion of the work , my car was freshly washed . i certainly recommend doing business with them .	2133
0	awful customer service after the sale . service department is run by amateurs . i can get a better level of service at jiffy lube . i can write paragraphs here about my bad experiences , but it all boils down to a complete lack of professionalism . i 've sent detailed information to ford motor co . i now travel 15 more miles to go sanderson lincoln for all my service . they know how to treat a customer who expects a little bit more from their luxury brand dealer . sanderson lincoln will also get my business when i 'm ready for a new car .	2754
1	i 've taken my car here for a few oil changes and i 've never had a problem . the guys in the shop were friendly and helpful and got my car in and out of the garage relatively quickly . they never messed up my appointments and never attempted to sell me anything i did n't need .	3640
1	great service and a lot too offer . i always am able find what i am looking for .	835
0	if you 're interested in wasting a lovely saturday afternoon with a large group of skeeze-bags , then this is definitely the place for you . not only will you be gawked at by the mouth-breathing salesmen , but you 'll have the treat of being run in circles , hassled and treated like a complete f*cking moron . i just spent 4 hours in the god forsaken pit of doom with my family and will never return . you could n't pay me to shop there . what a f***ing nightmare . thats my review . never . again . period .	2673
0	the portions are small and the food is pretty average overall . this place seems to try too hard to be something they are not . you could get better food at pf changs and for a better price .	171
1	my home away from home..the class instructors are amazing..the staff is great and i love that my daughter has a place to have a great time and is safe during my workout..two thumbs up	3268
0	i received a certificate for a blow dry and makeup . the certificate said it expired in december . when i called to make an appointment they said that it expired , the makeup for no longer valid . i was going to get all dressed up for a photoshoot with my cousin and give the pictures to my dad for father 's day . guess i ca n't do that now .	1508
1	how does this place have so little amount of stars ? it 's pepe 's tacos , not some fancy mexican cuisine restaurant . the staff has always been very friendly and the food is even more amazing . my girlfriend and i love to come here and get the menudo and a quesadilla with al pastor meat . this is definitely one of my favorite places to go to when i need great authentic mexican food . the only place that i have to say is better is felipito 's .	857
0	i purchased a voucher for a 90 minute therapeutic session through livingsocial . i have not received the massage yet but i just called to schedule an appointment using the voucher , i was told that they were fully booked for the next four weeks . i have the impression that this company is running a scam to purchase a voucher and then making it very difficult if not impossible to use the voucher .	1785
1	believe the hype , this place is a total win . the honey toast is on point . the barista was excellent , informative , and very friendly . the white mocha is on point . the hangover tea ... killed my hangover . the ambience is perfect for a coffee shop . really chill music and the decor is super vintage . great study/date/after dinner coffee spot . go ! it will not disappoint : ] and it 's a small business ... support it .	2219
0	if you are reading this post prior to finalizing your car rental here then turn the other way and run fast . this place is a scam the price you see on your travel sites wo n't be the final price you pay at the counter . thinking of insuring the rental vehicle through your credit card or personal insurance ? forget it . they will come up with lame bull**** reason and say your card/insurance does n't qualify . they go on to forcing you to purchase their insurance at absurd rates . i highly suggest sticking with enterprise or hertz . beware .	3576
0	i have been to this location before without any issues . today i walked in and the woman was completely rude when asking why i was there . then after i said i just wanted my gel nail polish removed to let my nails breathe , they were completely confused . the woman who was doing my nails kept trying to change my mind which was irritating as i said previously that i wanted them to grow back because they are really damaged . i asked for a manicure and did n't expect to pay the amount i did for the service i received . there is still gel polish on my nails and they look terrible . i wo n't be back after today .	3441
1	i 'm writing this on behalf of my wife and myself . in addition to my wife 's regular checkups for about a decade , dr. grade was the doctor for all three of our children . we 've always felt in the best hands with her and we 'd highly recommend her as a doctor .	3406
1	the staff was friendly and respectful towards me . they were knowledgeable and the paperwork process was quick . i had to wait about 40 mins before i could get to the vehicle to get my belongings . the guy that drove me to the vehicle was also very friendly and patient . i only knocked off a star because while i do n't mind waiting , waiting outside when it 's 107 outside is pretty unbearable . water fountain was n't functional and soda machines were out of order .	2428
1	red velvet cupcakes that dreams are made from ! the ooey gooeys are great too . and the bread us delish . and ... i could go on , but you should just go . their service is good , prices are as expected for a downtown bakery , the parking can be tough , and i 'd avoid it on first friday .	1125
1	very impressed the ladies did a great job ! i have used maid services over the years and rhino 's crew was top notch . i am so very glad i found them . highly recommended	3647
0	what to say about big in japan , in one word : baaad ! ! in a few more words : the food is not authentic japanese , light years away from perfection usually found in real japanese restaurants . ramen soup was too salty and greasy , it really tasted bad . really a disappointment , go to ramenya or kazu , much better culinary experiences than this cafeteria .	1582
1	we have been nothing but satisfied with dr. kim and her staff . they are accommodating , friendly and extremely pleasant . although there are tons of choices nearby we will always come back to southwest eye institute . ps : great with kids , first timers , and contacts .	313
1	this place is amazing . the food and the selection was outstanding . they come in 3 's and its meant to share so if you are going be prepared to eat a lot of tacos and drink a lot of beverages ! ! we 've heard so many great reviews of this location and it was worth the wait and lived up to all the positive things we 've heard . great location , and great atmosphere !	1305
0	bought a groupon for $ 100 . the service man called and did show up on time , which is great . he tried to make me pay $ 180 additional when the groupon said it 's a full house cleaning . he told me there is a return vent and incoming vent , which is common in all ac units . but they only cover 1 , so additional charges apply to all groupons . i said no thanks , and return groupon .	3687
0	the soft pretzel machine is almost always broken . young man at the register was very nice . shared the machine has been down for a month .	1815
0	you get what you pay for . french manicure on toes looks like a white stripe covered with clear . gel polish on fingers is all over my cuticles . oh well . it was cheap and fast .	1306
1	we sat up at the front tables , so we had a great view of the sets & costumes . very tastefully done . the costumes were amazing , and the sets a bit dated , but it was almost like an `` overly dramatic '' soap opera . would have been amazing if the music was live . music is pre-recorded , along with some of the vocals . some vocals are live . did the backstage tour the next day , so we were able to see some of the costumes & sets up close . oh , the costumes ! !	3069
1	this is my go to place ! when i need anything vape related this is where i go . they have a very knowledgeable staff and a very wide selection of supplies . everything from mechanical mods , rba 's , rda 's , electronic mods , tanks , kits , and lets not forget the fresh made to order e-juice . if you do n't know what any of this is , but are interested in vaping this is the place to go to have all your questions answered .	2715
1	first , do n't forget it 's cash only , and then they want it before they start . second , if you want a gel soak off it 's $ 7 , but they do n't waive it if you are re-upping on the gel polish . so ... add $ 27 to your gel manicure or pedicure . they never answer the phones , which can be frustrating . however : they are nice . they know what they are doing . the decor is okay , and they do have fresh packs of tools that they sanitize between each set .	2686
1	*** edit : not sure why , but i made the update to the location and they moved my review to the old location and deleted it here . they even took my new picture and attached it to the old location . *** i believe this is a new location first of all . it is in the same general location as the old one though ? in any case the front desk girls were helpful and quick to get us signed up despite being a walk-in . i am not sure how much faster it would be with an appointment but im guessing that they fit you in as they can around the appointments . all the appointments online were full .	3325
1	keiko is the best ! she 's got the best skills in the business ! too bad i live in chicago now , but every time i come back to the city , i make sure she 's my first stop !	3360
1	loved this hidden gem ! ! great father / daughter team . yummy breakfast ... .good conversation . my breakfast was cooked to perfection .	990
1	i went today for the first time to spazzing nails , and was welcomed . they very nice and clean i will go back there .	2922
1	pretty good coffee that is located just before the sands convention center and the halfway point from the venetian and palazzo hotel . this is convenient for convention goers who needs a pick-me-up from all the hustle and bustle and chaotic events they are either required or want to go to . all their drinks are delicious . almost every time , i get my usual iced hazelnut latte ! ! yum ! ! ! ! they make the perfect balance of hazelnut flavoring , milk and espresso . my friend usually orders her ice blended white chocolate mocha . cafe presse is sooooo much better than coffee bean . come here to get your coffee fix instead .	2397
1	newly renovated with a nice gym , great breakfast and it was only $ 57 . stay here if you want a quality night sleep .	3227
1	dion and his team did a great job remodeling my bathroom . they framed out a shower , redid the plumbing for the shower head/handle , installed a window , and did all the tiling . they worked with me on price , were amazingly responsive despite me adding items to the job , and still gave me an amazing final product . would use them again and recommend them to others .	2691
1	bought groupon deal ... one massage and one facial . then i read all the mixed reviews . really ? the massage was fantastic and since this was my first facial i thought it was great ! everyone was extremely nice . loved the music ! ! ! ! will definitely recommend and definitely return !	2320
1	i 've been going to this mall for years and i would say it is one of the best malls in phoenix . i wish they would add a little more variety to the food court but overall , good .	2815
1	chris and the entire staff at ace appliance repair were great ! they were able to work with my husband 's work schedule and the customer service was the best ! i would definitely use them again and recommend them to anyone that may have issues with their appliances . keep up the good work ! ! !	395
0	buyer beware ! if your planning on purchasing hair extensions , do your research . the employees have little or no knowledge of 100 % virgin remy true human hair . they do not warrant or guarantee the hair . also , the hair care products are cheap/poor yet costly . i personally spent several hundred dollars on hair extensions and extension application . the hair was defective & matted after two weeks ! ! ! the owner was not willing to refund or resolve my issue , the owner told me that royal imex inc. does not standby their product . i will never spend another dollar at this establishment. ! buyer beware !	1659
0	this is a grand hotel with a lot of history but rooms clearly past their prime . while rooms are clean , they are a bit small and outdated , in need of renos . lobby and common areas are great however when we got to our floor , hall carpets were worn and dirty , so definitely need replacing . gym and pool areas are in great shape . probably one of the best hotel gyms i 've experienced to date . thankfully we stayed in the summer and had lots of outdoor activities to keep us busy . i ca n't imagine staying in this hotel during the winter months as rooms are very small and somewhat claustrophobic .	1671
0	even with the low rating , this is the only place i get pizza from in oakland . it 's just sort of like a tradition ; no other pizza shop can compete with the antoon 's large plain pie for less than 5 dollars . get the garlic crust . it 's not on the menu , but they 'll prepare your crust with some extra spices and flavors which makes you think you 're eating something delicious instead of cheap .	662
1	mike and his crew did a very good job on our backyard waterfall . i waterfall is about 20 years old and had a lot of cracks and was leaking water . we also had part of a palm tree growing out of the stonework . he was very knowledgeable and experienced . prompt to the minute ! and we felt he did a very good job with his crew . he was on site most of the time for the job and would highly recommend using again .	2229
1	this is one of those places that is jut on a whole new level compared to the competition . the cakes they put out are almost too pretty too eat ! and yes they are as delicious as they are beautiful . the designs for the cakes are amazing . just look at there portfolio . we had a suit case cake made and it looked like i could just open it up and pack . sooooo realistic . the cake pops and all the little small goodies they make are equally if not more delicious than the cake . if there was a 6th star ; i would give it to them	981
0	went there to get a fill on 2/3/18 . a man i 've never seen before does my nails . i have to remind him to fill some of my nails with acrylic and he completely messed up my shape as you can tell in pictures . i had a darker gel polish on my fingers previously and as you can tell the polish was not taken off correctly and you can see it on the new nails . i usually come here often to get my nails done but after this experience it may be time to find a new salon .	3410
0	first and last time i eat here . i ordered chicken parmesan chips & reg drink ... a little over $ 10.00 . took over 15 minutes ! surprised there was no real chicken breast but sliced or shredded chicken bits . this is the first chicken parm . i 've had that had sliced chicken and not a regular breast . not impressed ... took way too long , drinks are expensive and food below average .	724
0	if i could cuss on here and not have my review erased by a moderator i would . this place is over priced . the famous bedazzled lollipops are defective and the refills do n't fit . tried to bring it back for my daughter and they wanted a receipt . i just wanted them to exchange it for a local 11 yr old without driving back to summerlin and looking for the receipt . this place has ridiculous prices on everything .	2021
1	best pho in the state , the flavor is on point . i will drive 25 minutes just to enjoy their soup . everyone is complaining about price but it is well worth the extra dollars . you get what you pay for !	205
1	i came here a year ago . i liked it better last year , possibly because they had alcohol . this time that i went , they did n't have alcohol anymore . they said because it got too crazy , drunk ass people throwing up all over the place , broken hookahs . i completly understand why they removed the alcohol ... : ( but it was a good time overall .	1229
0	i was actually excited to get an appointment with this lady . i called her several times and text her twice . she never returned my calls or texts . it was all just a waste of time . she should let people know she 's not accepting new clients or whatever her reason is for not returning calls . why have a webpage ( nailspatricia.com ) that says call to schedule appointment ? ? ? ? i find that to be unprofessional and rude . i found someone great though , her name is lucy . she 's at mod nails she 's really good at nail art , 3-d , stones etc .	2742
1	i recently purchased a new trek crossrip from the trek store and could n't have been happier with the helpful staff in guiding the purchase , quickly getting a bike for a test ride , and getting the bike out of the door right away . the sales manager james gave great advise on the differences between platforms in the bikes i was interested in and set me up with the perfect bike in my price range with the features i wanted . will be looking forward to going back to the shop for tune-ups and to kit up my new ride !	2543
0	i was treated unfairly by this establishment . was told 10 min wait . 30 min later i was placed in soaking water while the individual went to help other customers . i sat for 20 min soaking in water with no communication from the staff . this was very unfair treatment . be upfront with your customers about time and provide equal treatment . walked down the road to liz nails and received exceptional service .	43
0	so overpriced , as adults we are going to watch over our kids , so if it is a family of 4 we pay $ 22 pp for one kid to sorta play ? ? for the price you pay this is n't worth it at all ! on the positive side , my little one aged 3y had lots of fun .	984
0	this is the third time this year that i have waited over my scheduled appointment time . staff did n't even tell me my doctor was running behind . this made me late for work . doctors charge us if we are late the same should apply to them .	1562
0	i meet mike at my storage unit . he looked at the contents of my 10x10 and 5x10 storage and asked questions about what was at the house . i offered to take him my house as it 's only a block away but he declined . mike said he would give the information to his boss and his boss would call me back . it 's been three days and no call . for me that 's very poor customer service . if you do n't need the business say so , do n't just leave customers hanging .	1645
1	this location just reopened , and it is shockingly beautiful for a fast-food joint . giant glass windows give a peek inside to the revamped interior , complete with the fancy-schmancy create-your-own-coke machine . we got our order to go , and service was super pleasant and expedient , although the dining room closes at 10pm which means that the drive-thru line gets backed up onto baum come 10:15pm . we 'll see if hours adjust based on demand . in the meantime , it 's the cleanest place to have `` quick '' food on baum/centre !	1199
1	spent just under 9 bucks for 4 donuts and a chocolate milk . they have an awesome selection of donuts . the flavors and variations remind me of voodoo donuts in portland , oregon . the young girl that was at the counter was very rude though and kind of put a damper on our first visit there . with the fun and sweet flavors they have , there should be fun and sweet people working too .	2053
0	this is the worst gromer puppy luv was owned by an amazing couple who were fantastic now this new owner is horrible the groomers are not good and the owners are very unprofessional and disrespectful i have never experienced such an awful service from an establishment now i have come to find out that other pass clients of the former puppy luv who have left because of the service of the new owners please be careful of your fur babies this one star is because i have to rate something to post because i would give the no star rating	3389
0	used to be very good food - atmosphere still good but food has been slipping the past few years even as prices increase . mussels were cold when brought out , many cracked shells and unopened bivalves . gritty . onion soup was good and beer choices are still great so go to it for a bar but skip for meal .	454
0	very disappointed i purchased a preowned vehicle took almost 5 hours before i left the dealership only to run out of gas three blocks from the dealership after they were closed they never even put gas in the vehicle they almost forgot to put the plate on the back of the car as well when they reopened i called to explain the horrific experience i had when i ran out of gas three blocks from the dealership . the person kevin i spoke to said he would have someone call in the morning no one did they got their sale i think that was the bottom line and they can care less about anything after	1557
1	i 'm in vegas baby ! had to get the toes done because i ran outta time back home and i made a stop at today 's nails . make a visit if you need any services . my toes look great ! ask for danny he made me feel # 1 !	2686
1	my doc was out of town so i got an appointment here . staff were friendly . i did n't face any of the rudeness others mentioned . the waiting room was packed so the staff are probably not getting paid much and are overworked . they were nice and answered my questions . these are a group of female nurses doing checkups and consultations . they even do check up on guys from what i heard . yes i did wait 30 minutes for my consultation but you can have that and more at any medical facility . if you get an appointment there 's less chance you have to wait .	2334
1	i called to make a reservation for a kid 's mani/pedi so there was a few minutes wait time . they have two pink butterfly spa chairs for little girls . my daughter enjoyed the whole experience and the manicurist was very detailed and meticulous . it was worth the money for my daughter 's birthday .	2390
1	i cant complain too much , i 'll just throw the important ones out there.. the coffee bar is terrible.. ive thrown out just about every espresso i 've ordered . probably more than 10 times.. just a tad bit pricey in the buffet/ deli section too .	433
0	let me start by saying , the place is very clean & the onsite employees were great . however , i 'd like to warn people who are about to sign a contract with them to be sure to read the `` small print '' ! my price per month went up substantially from the contract i signed , but of course it was in the small print that they can raise it whenever they wanted . despite my verbal assurances from 3 different people of the cost . my lesson has been learned !	1857
0	really got taken for a ride by the service dept . first they charge $ 125 per issue for inspection . my traction control on my certified pre owned odyssey was not functioning . also the tpms light was on . they wanted $ 250 just to inspect both issues see . it told them not to check the tpms too much . they charged me $ 202 and did not fix either issue . complete rip off . never going back	3074
1	first time for us to try this place last night . they gave us a little bucket of popcorn for free after we ordered . i do n't eat octopus but they said the takoyaki was yummy . i ate the fried squid and chicken and they were both delicious . tried both roasted milk tea and hokkaido milk tea and those were good too . their menu has so much stuff in it so we will go back and try the other stuff .	344
1	i took my two long haired chihuahuas in for grooming today and the experience was lovely . the front staff and jesus were kind and welcoming . jesus had a consultation with me first and did everything to perfection . jesus also had to work with another groomers mistakes and was not negative or complaining about having to fix these problems . thanks i will certainly be returning in the future . great vegan choices too .	2043
1	i had a great experience . tattoo artist travis was professional , the whole staff was friendly and i absolutely love my tattoo ! this is my 3rd tattoo and it 's been many years since the last two but i would n't change a thing ! would much rather pay a little more for a great tattoo from a seasoned staff than go to a place where you do n't know what you 're getting . thanks starlight !	2912
0	buyer beware ! shady business . keep looking for someone else . dishonest & unprofessional ! will take your money & overcharge your cc without any invoice or conversation , pretty sure that it 's illegal & we will report to better business bureau . rent from someone else !	1334
0	went here on a sunday night with the travelzoo deal ( $ 79 for two people -- shared appetizer , two soups or salads , two entrees , shared dessert , and two glasses of champagne ) . tax and gratuity is based on regular price of $ 198 . this restaurant needs to make sure there 's food available . they basically had only three entrees to choose from -- 8 oz filet , 12 oz filet , ribeye , or the salmon . ordered the petite filet and definitely nothing special . the only dessert they had available was the churros . finally , service was nothing special . place was very pretty and nice though .	971
1	by far one of cleanest pho places . the lady who owns it is an amazing , sweet lady . customer service is excellent and the food never ever disappoints me . my favourite drink is avocado with condensed milk . i highly recommend having one of their shakes or specialty drinks ! ! ! ! ! !	707
1	customer service is the best . i take my 4 year old daughter but she 's been going since the age of 3 . dr. stacey really takes the time to explain everything and makes sure you understand . he never rushes and is very knowledgeable . my daughter feels comfortable and he makes her smile . the office is always clean and the staff is always polite . i would definitely recommend the foot and surgical group to anyone looking for a good doctor and staff .	1795
0	we did a tour of this daycare this week and i was astonished . the director and front office staff is unprofessional . upon walking through the door my husband and i were hit with the smell of rotting food and dirty diapers . after being taken through the facility it was very dirty the walls are dirty the floors had stuck on dirt and what i think was dried food . the one year old room had about 7 infants wandering aimlessly with two instructors walking around ignoring the babies . we could n't get out of there fast enough and warn parents to stay far away ! !	3582
1	i have been an office tenant since february 2006 , and i think the place is great . the staff is very professional and attentive to the tenant 's needs .	1157
0	the worst customer service when you make an appointment and you sit for an hour and a half before you see somebody	1635
1	i tend to go to this particular place after work on tuesdays as they have $ 1.50 fish taco deal . their fish tacos are really good . place is clean , curteous and efficient staff . their salsas are the best among other fast food joints . price-wise if you do n't have any coupon or deals , rubio 's is a bit more expensive than fast food in general , but the quality and freshness make up for slight premium .	1245
0	it is very dirty , dirty mismatched socks on the ground , dirty dryer sheets all over and all around dirty with kids who run around unsupervised ! will never be back .	2332
1	i had john the owner here . he did a speedy and excellent job . very well mannered . i would use them again .	3138
1	daniel and his team are consummate professionals . they show up when they schedule , they clean up after themselves and they do awesome work . could n't be happier with our new countertop and backsplash . precision granite is the bomb ! thank you .	1861
0	rented from andrew 's `` company '' . should be called `` andrew 's mom 's company '' . experience not good . poor business acumen is an understatement . check ripoff report for complete story . fraudulent business practices , does n't return calls , ca n't keep staff long enough to establish continuity of relations with the customer . steals by blending invoices , confusing , hiding , and obfuscation . if you call him out he becomes a bully and makes threats . still owes me over $ 400 dollars . beware !	1465
1	stopped by around 1 pm to buy white non-cargo petite scrub pants . amanda showed me the product , i tried it on , bought it . i was in and out in 5 minutes . prompt assistance . polite staff . they do their jobs well . healthcare professionals get 10 % off , bring your badge : )	1920
1	i stayed in pittsburgh for two weeks this past june , and this was my go-to hangout . i agree with other reviewers that it was indeed stuffy and not at all a refuge from the heat , but their americanos were delicious , i was always able to find a good seat , and its location provided good people-watching . i preferred this place to the location on forbes and to caribou .	596
0	food was average . steak was a little tough and the bread before the appetizer seemed a little cheap . my `` warm apple cobbler '' was cold- : ( . i did enjoy the wedge salad . probably wo n't be back unless it 's free .	1538
0	the lady handling the auto registration was rude and lacks customer service skills . other than her , i was provided with fast service .	359
1	very good massage . ivy was so professional and strong . defintely coming back very good massage . ivy was so professional and strong . defintely coming back very good massage . ivy was so professional and strong . defintely coming back	735
0	i would not come here again . the food offered is the usual buffet menu you 'd find anywhere . food was warm at best . the one positive i can offer is that the place is clean .	1302
0	yes , there is a `` eat at your own risk '' type warning for the smoked salmon . i unfortunately developed food poisoning after eating the honey-glazed smoked salmon sandwich last month . i was chained to the porcelain throne from 4 pm to 4 am and had to miss a day of work . it was pretty much a bagel with pieces of smoked salmon and chopped onion/tomato on top of a bagel . no cream cheese was put on it ( which would probably help anchor down the ingredients ) , and the whole thing fell apart on first bite . the workers are friendly and the drinks are fine ; but i 'm never coming back here .	3372
0	had lunch today and would probably not go back . resturant is clean , but food and service is another thing . waitress acted like we were a bother to her from the start . never once smiled or acted like she cared if we were there or not , pretty much acted bothered the entire time . i ordered the red , white and blue sandwhich off of the `` specials menu '' it was shredded deli turkey on a dry roll with no flavor what so ever . not at all what the description of the sandwich on the menu said .	1520
1	some of the friendliest , most efficient starbucks employees i have ever encountered . great experience here . everyone seems to take pride in their work and provides great service . exemplary starbucks location . the new cascara coconut milk latte was bomb , too !	453
1	prompt and immediate service . the receptionist was very cute and courteous . ashley and jann checked my blood pressure , brought it down and made recommendations . they were both very pleasant and comforting . thanks so much banner for a gratifying experience . there was no md .	2058
0	absolutely horrible . i arranged to have them fix a small star crack in the windshield , and the repair failed within 2 days . they refused to take any accountability for their negligence , and even left a condescending voicemail that i had the option to either file a claim with my insurance or pay for a new windshield out of pocket . i would have been better hiring someone to hit my windshield with a hammer , the end result would have been the same . i would never willingly use these incompetent buffoons again .	2036
0	stick with canes which has real pieces of chicken not nuggets ! this place is overpriced .	998
1	it 's close and a bit fact ire for roosevelt area . so it 's a nice change and a fun spot . monday food bar is the best ! ! ! !	3562
0	the food was bland and tasteless . the chow mei fun was dry . singapore chow mei fun had little spice , what it did have came from a few crushed pepper seeds . we were completely and fundamentally disappointed . our son ordered sesame chicken which was sub par . again , absolutely no flavor . the boneless ribs were cooked to death and were tough and dry . the staff did not greet us or return a greeting . i will never ever . waste $ 40 like that again . if i could give this restaurant a negative score , i would .	668
0	this has to be the most over priced lkandscaping service in town for the quality of service delivered . numberous times the gardners have run over sprinklers and left them to sprout water . then you call to have them repair it and they dont come until their scheduled time . ive had to repair them myself . the last straw was a broken valve left leaking and cut irrigation lines left unrepaired . buyer be super aware ! ! ! !	2387
0	first and last time i will be going to this restaurant . i was served chicken that was n't fully cooked . i had rated the thinner side of the chicken first so i thought it was cooked but got to the middle and there was a thick pink line through the center . the waitress apologized , took the entree off the bill but still charged us for my salad . no manager came by or anything . worst experience at a restaurant i 've ever had . here 's to hoping i do n't get sick .	1147
0	never have any salads in stock . their bistro boxes all have at least 40 ingredients , many of which are bad for you ! ca n't believe they pump simple food full of so much junk !	1216
1	all of my online bidding has lead to some wonderful purchases . rachel davis fine arts has a stellar reputation in cleveland and the fine art auction world . i ca n't imagine going anywhere else for my historical art collection . this is an auction house at it 's finest , excellent communication and world class art .	3222
1	i use to always go here for banquets and the pizza and wings were always awesome ! including the ceased salad . the wings were spicy enough and the pizza is sooo cheesy . i go here about once a month .	1482
0	i 'll stick with the one on 59th and thunderbird from now on . i requested to have the bagels cut ... nope . although i received the correct kinds of bagels , they gave me a different count ... it was like they ran out and just decided what they 'd like to give me . a plain bagel is not interchangeable with an everything .	3571
1	good cleaners for routine cleaning . usually takes about 2 days . $ 2.50 for shirts and $ 4.50 for pants . took some long sleeve shirts in to become short sleeves and they did well with that , also took my jeans in for alterations and they were just okay .	2982
1	yummy food at great prices ! ! ! they deliver really quickly and you can order through the eat24 app and pay using google wallet . i have never been disappointed with either the food or service here . i have to admit i have not tried the pizza but the gyros and chicken cheese steak are delicious ! ! !	987
1	excellent ! only one downside : very very small counter for dining in , seats max 2 people now for the good : we had the rib eye steak burritos ( one with rice and one with noodles ) ask for it with no chipotle and extra spicy sauce for a kick love that they use high quality rib eye steak , cooked perfectly + fresh tomatoes and cheese incredibly tasty - would make a special trip into this area to eat again	834
1	dr. poremba and staff , so caring and finest people . i want to thank dr. poremba and mary for treating me so well . i have been through drastic dental issues my whole life and getting to the point where there is not much to do about it and having the dr. explain in such a caring way about my situation i left the office feeling hope and thinking positive on there is still something we can do . this is a great place to go , i highly recommend dr. poremba ! i wish i had seen years before !	1082
1	we turn in my wife 's car for a fender and bumper repair . i had checked with 2 other body shops . price was just a little higher . but i picked this from reviews . sometimes the price is not the determining factor for me . turn it in on monday with a week as eta for the car being done . on wednesday mid-morning received a call car will be ready at 4 pm . one thing was overlooked . but it was not the reason the car turned in for . a little chip on the door handle was missed . but it was an afterthought . can you do this ? so no big deal . still a 5 star review .	3765
1	great sushi place ! ample portions of sashimi . unagi is the best i 've had . and do n't forget the tako salad . the atmosphere is okay . it 's not bad , but not exactly cool . of course , if it were 4 miles south ( in old town scottsdale ) , you 'd never get a table .	198
1	i drive from scottsdale to come here whenever i need something done to my car . they always take care of you and try to get you on your way as fast as possible . i have been coming here for 5 years and i would n't trust anyone else to work on my car than these boys . especially al and mike . they are the two best people whom work there .	3640
1	i went and saw deadpool 2 today ! the theater was super hot inside and after telling them to cool it down a little ; nothing changed . the staff there is super friendly and willingly to help out . first time there and i will continue going there .	491
1	my friend has been recommending this place to everyone she knows and i see why . the staff is very nice and welcoming . i tried a pedicure and it was well worth it they spent the extra time and give excellent massage exfoliate and polish . i found my new regular place .	3213
0	i would recommend this place if you have kids which was n't the case with my boyfriend and i . this place is part of the toronto city pass which i would say was one of the most disappointing places offered . i know that the science center may have kids but everywhere we looked seemed like it was meant for kids and not adults . my boyfriend and i have went to liberty science center which was free and way better than this science center that costs about 20 cad per adult .	2868
0	extremely disappointed with this hotel . we stayed for two nights . it is beautiful and clean but that is where it stops . my family and i were in bed at 10:30 asleep and got woken up to housekeeping in the room next door cleaning and vacuuming . they tell us they clean rooms until 11:30 . wth . second the people in room next to us came in at 3am . you can here everything . walls are so thin you can even hear them in their bathroom . i heard every word they said . went to front desk i . the morning and just got an apology . never will i stay at this hotel again ! ! !	1859
0	i worked there in 1975 . clean , busy and vibrant . fast forward 40 years . dilapidated , ugly , empty , smelly dump . most of the stores in and around the mall have high tailed it out of there . why anyone would go there is beyond comprehension . just call for the bulldozers and do the area a favor .	2813
0	the front desk staff are nasty , rude people ! they do n't want to help , they make you feel like you are an inconvenience ! ! ! ! as if we enjoyed going in ! it 's obvious that if people go in there is because , they are in need of medical help ! otherwise we , would n't go in ! i will not be going back there , nor would i send people there anymore ! ! ! this place either needs to close or the front desk staff need to change ! ! ! ! it 's ridiculous , to be under stress because of injury or illness and to have these people make you feel worse ! !	121
0	these people do n't deserve one star . they are over priced and the manager james sucks . his people skills is horrible . i would not ever stay here again . most hotels allow for a late check out at no charge these people do n't even though the room i reserved and paid for was n't ready . the young woman who was in charge was great but the room had what looked like water damage . do n't stay here !	3162
0	good luck trying to buy a bike here . 30min inside this place and not 1 person approached me . today i was ready to buy a bike and this would have been my first purchase . kudos to you if you do n't have customer service and still be in business . being that we are in las vegas the hospitality capital of the world , this place is far from it . the mechanics working on the bikes had more to say than the people trying to sell them .	94
1	i visited this place the morning after i arrived with my wife . my bartender was tim & he was incredible . it was n't busy , so tim took the time to welcome us to las vegas . the conversation was great and tim was so damn friendly . if you ever visit the excalibur , please visit sherwood forest bar and ask for tim .	2688
1	got a 15 % off instant coupon for checking end ! that truly rules ! thanks jeff , this rules .	1317
1	i love there pizza it has to be the best pizza . there always so fast and nice in that store !	375
1	so glad i called this office , i was able to get an appointment right away . the visit was super quick and the provider was so friendly . he answered all my questions about my acne scars and moles . : - ) the staff was really nice too ! no complaints here .	3598
0	worst customer service in the store and on the phone . i went in and was treated poorly a few months ago . thought i would give them another shot ... i called to inquire about a cooking class for my daughters 10th birthday for her and 10 of her friends . i got a very rude ( `` no we do n't do kids parties '' ) . the rude lady basically hung up on me . i called sur la table at kierland and they are estactic to host a great cooking class for my daughter and friends !	2612
1	i love this place . moved to cave creek 2 years ago but always worth the drive . so very accommodating . i never wait longer than appt time . love kaila & rose and and ly for pedicures . i used to go to lily , but she 's not as customer oriented .	2297
1	we sat outside on the patio . the weather was beautiful and we really enjoyed the food . i wish they would n't allow smoking out there because having to hold my breath each time the old lady took a puff kinda ruined the pleasant atmosphere . the margaritas are $ 3 during happy hour . they were ok ... hardly any alcohol . the service was great . everyone was very nice . the food was really delicious . i 'd recommend trying it sometime !	882
0	this office has gone to he 'll ... plan on a lot of phone calls to get anything done because everybody has a different answer , usually they do n't know or tell you anything to try to aprase you !	3321
0	i got married on may . i have n't received my photo yet ! do not go this place . the lady at the front dest is very rude . she play games with costumer . do not go this place	3867
0	awful service by the pharmacy . i never been treated so rudely in my life . they 've screwed up my meds and been later multiple times and then charged me a copay that had never been a copay before ? never returning because of the pharmacist . she acts like you 're a burden .	1097
1	what a fantastic time ! ! amy mac was our hostess , and i just give her a huge positive shout out . she was so professional , and showed us every exciting corner of the taco festival ! we sampled so many street tacos and margaritas . all were great ! the korean spot was our favorite . it was great to be hanging with all our local and fellow desert dwellers . again big shout out to amy mac for showing us a good time ! !	1392
0	very expensive ! ! ! beware . i took a pair of pants to be hemmed and they charged $ 18 . everywhere else in the neighborhood is $ 9- $ 11 . nordstrom 's is only $ 11 . i will never go back . they do decent work but nothing better then the rest .	2858
1	our technician , darryl , was awesome . he was professional from the get go and was on time . he even wore booties over his shoes which was very considerate . darryl was extremely knowledgeable and explained everything very eloquently . our downstairs heater was n't working before he arrived . he went up into the attic and took a video of the problem with our furnace . he went out to his van and retrieved a new replacement item and changed it right away . i am no longer freezing ! this company pricing is fair and affordable . i will always call sierra air if there are any future issues . thanks darryl ! !	1718
0	probably the worst branch i have ever been in . average employee iq must be in the single digits . ugh !	1100
1	love this dentist . my daughter has been going here since she was 2 and loves going . they are very professional and kid friendly .	1951
1	one of my go to late night restaurants ! there 's so many options , but they do n't rush you to choose . it 's a bit hard getting the attention of the staff to order , but they certainly get your order out quickly . overall the food tastes pretty good and came out piping hot . the popcorn chicken was a bit on the salty side but definitely tasty !	176
0	this office charges an annual fee of approximately $ 50 to all of their patients . insurance companies do not pay the fee . it is paid by the patient . some at this office have tried to compare it to and equating the $ 50 yearly fee to a `` gym membership '' when it is really nothing but pure greed . i also know of one doctor in this office who has bad mouthed other doctors within the same office . wonder if they have any kind of `` code of ethics ? '' i highly suggest you find a different medical/doctor 's office .	236
0	they do n't even keep the proper oil filters in stock . had to wait forever . will never go back to big o . big o mistake !	2146
1	first time i had a waffle breakfast sandwich . - loved it ! staff was super friendly and they work fast . i ordered 10 meals to go and they got on it right away . definitely will have breakfast here again when i 'm back in vegas !	580
1	this store is clean , staff is friendly , and the store is decent . they priced matched an online company for a purchase and made a few suggestions for shopping with target in the future . the prices are great and i found a few items that other stores did not carry .	1178
1	this place has changed a lot in 4 years ! it was soooo much nicer but ... ..mila the women working front desk wednesday july 5 around 11pm is amazing and a hero ! ! ! !	3337
0	do n't bother . bad work . very high prices . gave them one chance . not going back .	1948
0	the office etiquette on the phones is terrible & every time i have called in , i get placed on hold by multiple people . not only is the office personnel rude but the dr. had me wait until 12:30 to see me when i called ahead for a 11:15 appt . yes she takes time to have a thorough visit with her patients but this is a business and punctuality needs to be taken more seriously . if you choose nursing as a career , you should understand that service should be a top priority at all times ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1598
0	i stopped into this place and evidently they do n't speak english because not one person said a word . in short , i 'll take all my `` mani and pedi money '' somewhere else .	2929
0	changing my review because when i walked out i realized my nails had been painted so badly that you could see streaks ! not only that , the acrylic nail on my pointer finger fell off within 24 hours ! went to another salon a few days later to get a much needed fill ( yup within less than a week ) , to fix my polish , and fix my pointer finger . my nail technician said that whoever did my nails the last time did a sloppy job . not to hurt any of the technician 's feelings at lucky 's nails , but looks like i did n't get so lucky .	3831
1	well first time i 've really had `` authentic '' japanese ; `` non-americanized '' ( no chicken covered in sugar sauce here ) . the chicken katsu is what i laid my eyes upon and i was pleasantly surprised when it came out . a good portion of chicken with many veggie and fruit options ; highly recommend . the place is small . the service is courteous but slow . those are negative remarks that only hold it back slightly . if you enjoy changing it up on your taste buds , check it out .	1
1	the guys here are always so friendly and helpful ! they go over everything throughly and answer all my questions !	2250
0	really bad staff suck . i had a golf cart and tire got flat and i changed my cart this came after me to get the cart that is changed and said you ca n't get a cart because i accidentally flat the tire for other car	3869
0	i was looking forward to posting a great review , but i was denied service because i live in the huntersville area . this company from what i was told by the secretary is in plaza midwood and ca n't afford to drive to my home . oh well , my search continues .	1811
0	i 've been going to this nail salon for a couple months and i love how the lady sitting in the first station does my nails shes always very gentle and she does a really good job she is very attentive . i went in today and the older man i believe his name is ( allen ) he sits in the middle station well he is very rude and rough he was huffing and puffing the whole time he was doing my nails and he cut me he was in such a hurry . i do not recommend him to anyone it was a horrible experience .	2929
1	i discovered 800 degrees after a few stays at sls ( it is tucked away , far from the entrance ) and now it is my `` go to '' restaurant whenever i 'm in vegas . the crust is divine and all the ingredients are fresh and tasty . try the margherita with yummy basil . oh , and unlike the $ 70 pizza rumored to be sold at rock in rio usa , this place right across the street is around $ 10 - $ 15 , depending on your toppings . well worth the short walk ! best of all , the staff is super kind and interactive with the customers .	282
1	i prefer yogurtland over pretty much any of the other frozen yogurt places in the area . they seem to be constantly changing the flavors , but always have the basic types . i like to mix flavors , but always get vanilla where ever i go , and they have the best vanilla bean .	2581
1	team took extra care of my car and got it sparkling ! great job !	3250
1	i love it here ! ! ! it is kept up really well and it is beautiful . everyone that lives here , that i have met , is awesome . there are a lot of restaurant options around and a variety of stores . i am happy to live here .	3475
0	pros : -quick check in and accommodating special request -extremely convenient , located minutes away from train station , bus station , restaurants -sheets are clean cons : -out dated room , feels like the renaissance era -stained carpet ( looked like bodily fluids ) -finding an electrical outlet is harder than finding waldo -2hour wait for room service apple pie and ice cream and still no where to be seen , called multiple times after the 1hour mark ( pretty sure even if it was made from scratch it would have been done earlier )	1671
1	have been coming here for years . always willing to fit me in . always great service . quality workmanship . i trust dr. thompson and recommend you try them out . they stand behind their work .	2246
0	the food is mediocre at best and my credit card number was stolen last week after making a purchase there . stay away unless you have cash . otherwise , it 's okay for a quick bite if you do n't have time for an alternative food option .	447
1	my fiancé and i are new to the phoenix area and have been in search of a yummy chinese food restaurant . well , our search is finally over . this place has very tasty and fresh chinese food . my fiancé loves the bbq pork appetizer and orange chicken and i 'm very fond of the beef and broccoli . we usually order delivery and the food is always delivered fast and hot . i ca n't wait to try more items from the menu .	1459
0	the toxic environment in my gated community , i once believed , was wholly due to an hoa board that could n't be gotten rid of . however , as the threats and bullying have escalated over the 3+ years i 've lived here , it 's been made clear to me that not only is the management company aware of the toxic situation , and the harassing and bullying board members ( past and present ) , they are complicit with and facilitate it .	3608
1	best pizza wings and fries i had in town ! they told me 45 mins but got here in 30 mins ! good delivery service !	459
0	upkeep is kept to a minimum . nhl playoff . one bartender - no waitresses . she 's busy as hell and smiling . phone rings and she 's saying fuck , please do n't be a delivery . it was .	1292
1	this is a great restaurant . the food is wonderful and authenticate . the atmosphere is nice and comfortable and a great place to bring the wife for a romantic dinner .	340
1	we are extremely happy with our courtyard fountain from little baja . emma was very helpful with talavera tile design & layout ideas . she kept us updated throughout the process , sending pictures of the install progress & making sure it was done to my specification . im impressed by the quality of the fountain , pricing , tiles , professional install and delivery . would highly recomnend them .	1987
1	great for breakfast bagels . real new york feel inside , some of the best bagels in vegas good prices . go here around once a month . i recommend the original .	414
0	unfortunately , they are extremely lacking in customer service . it disappoints me when i feel like they could take or leave my business . i live in the neighborhood and would prefer to drive across town , instead of giving them my future business . dolce lusso is right down the street - i recommend you try them for your nail & spa needs .	3369
0	this place had great deals on cars , however their customer service was lacking . my salesman was rude and did not care if my time was wasted . the manager was unorganized and unprofessional . this was the worse car experience i had . i ended up not buying from them due to my experience and their lack of professionalism when it came to financing a car .	290
1	very friendly staff and efficient service . lineup can get pretty long during the weekends , but the staff try their very best to keep the line moving quickly . the only real downside to this location is the lack of seating . wi-fi is actually pretty strong up to the couches and benches in front of claire 's ( at least in my experience ) and it 's usually easy to find a spot to sit here .	2438
1	love this place , in every way !	3891
0	what a joke ! ! ! ! ! ! these cooker bugs couldent cut a fart with a bean burrito ! they installed an amp & subs in a girls car that kept failing ? that 's because the amp was only stable at 2ohm & they wired it to 1ohm ? ! ! ? ! ! in layman 's terms it 's kinda like drinking gasoline & pissing on a bonfire ! ! ! ! ! if you want to legally get out of a car payment by burning it to a crisp take it to these schlemiel 's ! ! ! ! !	2427
1	great location . helpful and friendly staff . much better than the previous owners who should not have been business owners .	980
1	bacon turkey bravo is my favorite ! always really friendly staff and the tea is top notch	484
1	sheetz is awesome ! i wish we had sheetz in denver or the west coast ! i was very impressed going to sheetz . i remember driving down the road and i saw this very colorful gas station , trying to figure out what it was and i pulled in . i saw the whole concept and loved every minute of it ! i love the food there ! bring them to the west coast ! ! ! !	2273
0	food was good , but quite greasy . delivery was frustrating . it took over an hour and a half when i was told 45 minutes . on top of that i was told it was 'on its way ' for a good 25-35 minutes . i would not order again .	1519
1	warm and welcoming environment with capable and pleasant yoga teachers . whether you 're a beginner or experienced practitioner , there 's a class here for you . love this place .	1251
1	i absolutely love this place ! such a beautiful spa and a perfect way to relax and clear your mind . their indoor/outdoor pool , steam room and sauna and their facilities are top notch . i love spending the day here to relax when i have downtime , but yesterday i actually included a treatment . i got a massage by ivan and it was one of the best massages i 've ever received . he worked on my problem areas and i felt like a whole new person when i was done . i will definitely be back and will continue to use the beautiful facilities !	2651
1	the bagels are amazing the breakfast sandwich the farm house was my absolute favorite the staff are really friendly ^^ make sure to sign up for their rewards	1214
0	be aware ! ! ! ! i reserved 120 '' lincoln mkt limo 08/06/2017 and they sent mb sprinter ( 9passenger van ) . no email , no notification at all until we saw the car at the las airport . the driver said `` all our limo have air conditioner problem today ... ... .. '' no apology from the company yet . no refund of difference at all . terrible company .	2901
0	disgusting ! they say they are new ? ! ? ? over my dead body . i can not say enough how sick we were over this place . yes , you get what you pay for but come on . hotel impossible should come here and see how disgusting it is .	2976
0	horrible service . there was a hair in my food and all the manager said was it was probably from people at my table cause of the wind . right cause there is wind inside . never again .	549
1	dripps soft opening is this week so we stopped by to try out their selection ! here 's the vanilla soft serve with oreo mixed in , topped with pocky sticks . it 's amazing how the infusion of their ingredients create a completely new experience . they served it in a delicious waffle cone decorated with a sweet drizzle . it felt like we were kids again eating ice cream on a hot summer day . i definitely recommend trying this spot out , they have a variety of mix-ins and add-ons for you to choose to your hearts desire . i 'm excited to return again and test out more combinations ! !	3051
0	one step inside this shop was enough to see this is not where i would want to get my frames/glasses . messy , disorganized , it looked like a hoarder 's den or a rummage sale -- tons of drawers , boxes , glasses packed close and on top of one another , often dusty . the staff was decidedly unhelpful , and the prices seemed completely arbitrary .	2125
0	1 star . came after wonderland . the bar & server crew was very unprofessional . 2 girls were on break and sat beside us that worked there & were running around and yelling and screaming . so loud i could not hear my friend that sat in front of me . my food was also burnt along with my cousins . would not go back . they need to hire or retrain staff for professionalism .	393
1	the buying process has been so easy with these guys , i did n't have the best credit situation to start with but they really took the time to help me out . and now i 'm driving away with exactly what i needed at a price i can afford ... .thank you so much jeff and team !	3518
1	great food and fun atmosphere ! the loud italian workers crack me up . the whole experience feels authentic . reasonable prices too .	768
0	a hole in the wall with outrageous charges . when i seen the menu and prices i turned around and left .	270
1	try the caramel dark mocha truffle , out of this world . also , supernova sandwichthe place is clean & service is great	3571
1	food was very good ! also very fresh ! ! the staff is somewhat rude . they are very short with you . we never got a refill on drinks . and every time the kitchen staff was out to check the food , you had to watch out where they were going . they could cut in front of you and stand right in the middle of everything like you are in the way . but good food ! large variety and stir fry ! !	135
1	price is kind of rough but very good hotel . everything was great .	1741
1	it wo n't change your life , but this is a nice place to get an efficient , inexpensive mani/pedi . i made an appointment which they were good about keeping , though the time of day i went i probably would n't have had any problem walking in . however , it 's worth noting that earlier in the day when i went to make the appointment , they were swamped so plan accordingly !	2555
1	red velvet brownie is probably my new favorite dessert !	1125
0	dr. peters was great but the office is filthy ! i could n't believe the dust on the computer , keyboard , and desk the assistant was using in the room . i took pictures and will try to post them . i was shocked that any doctors office could be so dirty , and that the staff seem to ignore it !	1977
1	i had excellent service as a new patient . facility was clean . check in was easy and i did n't have a million papers to fill out . ma listened and cared . endocrinology pa spent time to explain things to me in detail . follow up was immediate as well . it was nice to feel heard and cared for .	2987
0	all these high ratings for what ? we ordered the pho here and the broth tasted like hot water . y'all do n't season your food or what ? straight trash . i 'd rather lick the floor than eat the pho again at least it would have more flavor .	205
0	i reported death threats my ex gf was receiving from her ex bf and phoenix pd did nothing about it . now they 're back together and i just got a picture after he punched her in the face . i 'm currently stuck at fort bragg , nc , but i swear to god if they fail to act again i 'm going awol to handle this myself .	2322
0	i am very disappointed from this place , when i gave them my shirts they just gave me a copy of the items that i 've left there . i 've asked for the cost and the owner just told me that it is hard to calculate , it 's too many items . when i came back i 've ended up paying over $ 75 for 12 shirts and 3 jeans repaired . i 've told them that it was too high for what i 've left there and they blamed me for not seeing the price list that is kinda hidden on a wall on the right side when you get in . everything was over priced . i will never used them again ...	2341
0	cheap car rental prices but slow shuttle response times . along with mediocre customer service as we had to call the emergency line to get a shuttle from the airport because no one answered the phone at the shop .	1905
0	jeff civillico was so boring & dry . i do n't find him humorous . my kids did not laugh . it is mostly juggling acts . not too much different that other acts . i will not see it again , ever. , , .	726
1	completely unremarkable , average target . much cleaner and safer-feeling than walmart , with higher prices , better quality ( mostly ) , and fewer items . not as nice as some super targets i 've been to in tucson , but 4 stars nonetheless .	2411
1	for a long time my kids tried to talk me into eating here , but i stuck up my nose because it was a sports bar , and how good could that be really ? i caved in one day and was i surprised . that was several years ago and now we go there at least once a week . we have tried almost everything on the menu and it is always superb . if you are into watching sports while you eat you will not be disappointed and if your not , well they keep the volume turned down so you do not even notice its on .	428
0	great customer service . pizza was ok . needed more sauce , and was bland . garlic knots were good .	768
0	walked in on saturday night . restaurant half empty but was turned away cuz no reservation ( along with 2 other parties ) ! promptly booked reservations on opentable and got seated . food good but service and general operations will doom this place to a short life : (	185
1	pricey but excellent care . they continued the care of my sick dog over the holidays when my regular clinic was closed . people may complain about the prices but they are employing staff 24 hours a day . the 24 hour clinic in our area ( on kingston road ) has had a lot of bad publicity so it was worth the trip downtown for excellent care	345
1	smooth as silk . unlike every other rental place with long lines there were only two people in front of us and we drove out in 10 minutes . everything a car rental experience should be .	3129
1	i went here yesterday to purchase a bag . after searching the internet for styles that i like , i came in armed with the names of about 10 bags . stacy was so awesome , she took each and every bag i wrote down for me to try on . she knew that this was my first lv purchase and she made the `` experience '' so nice . i wish buying something was always this pleasant . i will be back to round off the purchase with a new wallet , with no money to put in there , since i spent it all in the store .	1493
0	people on cell phones while hogging equipment is out of control . nothing can get the point across better than this video . complaints to management by myself and others do not work in making this club enforce their own rules on equipment use . here is a link to the video on youtube . please feel free to share it . https : //youtu.be/vtk-mrwvzcc	3268
0	came by for toronto 's `` best caesar . '' visually impressive but its an average caesar . the cucumber ( pickle ) that engulfs the drink makes it impossible to drink ( not given a straw ) . it would be wise to ask for a plate and cutlery . the taste and viscosity of the drink is , like i said , average . the snacks that towers over the glass are pickle , 3 olives , a spicy pickles bean and a pepperette . it just was n't my cup of cocktail .	3147
1	an absolutely beautiful surprise bouquet ! it 's been almost two weeks and they are still going strong . my fiancé said he walked in and asked for a bouquet on the spot . he said they were helpful , accommodating , and reasonably priced . would recommend and will be a repeat customers .	3547
0	i called nhw for a suspected leak . i canceled the original claim , as extensive mold damage was found and an insurance claim was made . after the demolition had completed , i called the nhw to come back out on to check the pipes and dishwasher for leaks . he confirmed to me that the dishwasher was in fact leaking.the nhw called and advised that they could do nothing for me because they could not be sure that the dishwasher was the source of the leak - against what the plumber indicated.i am seeking that national home warranty uphold their end of the contract and pay to repair or replace the dishwasher that has caused $ 1,000s in damages to my home .	3653
0	somebody please take this tired old dog out behind the barn and shoot it ! no food court anymore , at least 80 % of all the stores are empty or closed and not even the brand new adjacent walmart could save this aging pile of crap .	2813
0	save yourself the time . zero stars . too bad . was in the market for two vehicles . bought one here . if a good experience , would have gladly bought another . far from it . stay as far away from this place as you can . i bet the good reviews are written by friends or family .	3305
0	i agree great selection , great salesman on my visits . whys the manager such a grump ? bought a new bike and had to come back for some adjustments which were promptly look after by my salesman and service tech . but every time i was in mr owner/ manager wow what a grump . especially when your dropping $ $ $ $ ! on a new ride come on guy cheer up .	227
0	not good , will not go back . did the ayce and servers did n't come around and when they did , were n't friendly at all . so many great restaurants to eat at - do not waste your time or money here !	1362
0	if i could give this place zero stars i would . i worked at the new location at the premium outlets in phoenix ! i was there for two days and decided the work environment was n't for me . ( first time working this kind of job ) i informed the owner and she was rude and blocked my number . she does not pay her employees for training ( training is from two weeks to a month told to be by the owner ) and fails to tell them that during the interview process . very unprofessional and the worst experience . plus , the soaps are over priced and overrated . this place sucks . spend your time shopping somewhere else !	3171
0	not my kind of pizza . i know plenty of people who love this place , but to me it tasted like a stale saltine with tomato paste on top . my theory is that the people who love it grew up on it , so maybe it 's a nostalgia thing ? i only had it once tho so maybe it was just an off night ... . or the recipe has changed ? but i 'll give it another chance .	900
0	this place is beyond filthy and there were so many old men it was crazy . i actually saw a old guy coming in with a cane and had to have help getting up the steps . it was awful . it felt like i was in a nursing home . the staff was very nice did not have any issues there .	3345
0	horrible atmosphere : the smoke from bbq is simply annoying ; overpriced beer and food . they play loud music till 2 am on the rooftop patio ! do n't know how they get away from the law and order and more astonishing how none of the residential condos complain about the noise . not going back ; not worth my money !	1583
1	friendly and easy going salespeople . the service department always makes you feel welcome .	3788
1	i am glad we payed the money for this tour . i love to see the inner workings of many things . you can watch the mini films on the dam . tour the museum . taking the elevator down to the lower levels and walking through narrow little caves was thrilling . engineering is amazing ! !	83
1	i have had a business account at sam 's club for going on 20 years . this store and this location have always been great ! i do n't remember ever having a problem . i even bring my service dog and they are more than welcoming to him ! customer service has also been great . i highly recommend not only this location , but sam 's club as a whole !	2556
1	excellent pho . great service . cute kid works here i give five starts cuz i do n't usually eat pho but i finish all of it	673
1	lost a star due to service . the hostess was horrible with allocating tables . there were empty tables that could have been utilized . very good mango shaved ice cream . try the chewy toast too !	1182
1	my favorite thai restaurant this far . delicious food and great atmosphere , food was served hot and with just the right amount of spice .	1450
1	very nice hotel situated near upscale dining and shopping within view of university of phoenix stadium , home of the cardinals . have had positive interactions with front-desk manager taylor keisling as well . this is a prime place to stay when going to a cardinals game .	1656
1	i had an insurance change and this place was in network . i was hesitant to go somewhere new and leave my current doctor . however , i 've been a few times now ( because i like to give a place a few tries before i do a review ) . i have been able to get appointments that work with my crazy schedule . i am also treated with respect and each staff member is friendly . they also got my glasses back really quickly before my trip . each charge is explained up front so there 's no unexpected fees . i will be back and refer others .	2466
1	today was our second meal at the new cafe in chandler . the service was great ... they have really worked hard to make ordering easy and we enjoyed tasty food . they have built a beautiful , bright , fun cafe . ca n't wait for the san tan location to open ! viva la france !	1276
1	awesome place for mexican ice cream and raspados ! i love the fresas con crema ( strawberries and cream ) only reason i didnt rate it 5 stars is that if you pay with debit its 50¢ extra and you have to spend at least $ 10 or more to use credit . they need a better merchant . cause i never carry cash .	1447
0	worst service the worst michalada i have ever had and to make things worse the bar tender got mad because i told him that it was no good ... .	190
0	this was the 3rd salon i tried out in vegas after diva 's studio and limelight salon . i came in for a a cut only . the stylist i had was real nice , and at that time had 2 years experience for hair . i asked for a bob cut . i liked she used scissors to cut my thick asian hair . my hair was shorter than i wanted and i was n't too impressed by how the bob turned out . i was n't too thrilled i spent $ 55 for it either . i guess it 's worth trying if my friends in the hospitality industry and at my government job were getting nice cuts here ... just not for me .	2113
1	this place is well -sanitized and has enough space to host lots of customers on rush hours . it even has wonderful terrace seats . you know that it 's very hard to find that kind of virtues around here . wendy 's cheese burger is definitely delicious . its patty is so juicy and breads are soft . drink option is cool , too . you can have free ice tea in side bar . my only complaint is the size of burger . is n't it too small ? ? ? ? ? ? i am an asian girl and do n't eat too much but still ... .. i was n't satisfied with the amount of it .	1199
0	15 minutes for a fried hotdog . 25 minutes for kimchi mushy fries . las vegas weekly food write up , really ? for those who are giving these positive reviews maybe it 's time you got in your car and went to try some real bulgogi in china town . for whoever put buldogis in the same category as bachi burger not even close . everything lacked flavor , salt , and most of all texture . if i am going to pay 12 dollars for a dog and fries it better be tasty .	1566
0	came in today to get some ink . website says walk-ins welcome . i came in with a design in mind but wanted to leave it up to the artists interpretation . they dissed my design and told me that i 'd have to book at least a week in advance as what i was asking for was complicated , also they had no artists working . i was there 10 min after opening on a saturday . no artists ? on a sat ? they were rude and un-helpful . i went down the street to another shop who drew it up in 45 min and did it with a smile .	2028
0	overpriced junk . new campers with roof leaks and warped flooring . do n't waste your time .	1353
0	disappointing . they spend all their money on the major travelling exhibits ( body worlds , narnia ) , so the rest of the exhibits look a little old and uninspired .	3891
1	bartenders are terrific , the singing is fabulous . great atmosphere . always have a good time here .	3326
0	this place was dirty , pedicure tubs filthy , nail stations with previous clients nail clippings ... .filthy ! also , i got gels there , and when i went back to my regular lady , she had to pretty much remove my natural nails to get off the previous junk that was placed on me !	1388
0	hands down worst massage i 've ever had . i do n't know why anyone would give this place good reviews , i suspect they 're employees . i had a full body massage . it was extremely painful because instead the employee just kept digging her elbows into me . she rarely used her hands , just kept elbowing me . i asked for an hour massage , but i stopped her after 15 minutes because i could n't take it anymore . this place is just odd .	2970
0	with all the sushi burritos open in this area and good reviews about this place i have high expectations about but the results does n't turn out the way i looking for . the burrito is so dry and no flavor is like they forgot to put any sauce in it . the only good thing is fish is good and fresh . i might give this place another try but i guess i have to try the another competition in this area so i can compare .	1354
1	best massage in vegas ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if you need a rub down you must go to this location . everyone was so nice and professional . clean and relaxing ! i loved my massage from ton . amazing ! ! ! go go go !	2399
1	i like this chipotles because it was nestled inside the hotel i was staying at . this location serves up way heftier meat portions than countless other chipotles i 've been to . 4 starts based off that alone ! !	214
0	zero . stars my wife has been seeing dr. wingard for 12 years . in the last three years my wife was diagnosed with idiopathic gastroperesis and still has n't received a pain management referral . my wife keeps getting the run around from this a hole . maybe a letter to the state medical board will help remind him of what he is suppose to do as a doctor !	115
1	thank you yelp for another yelp recommended find . i tried this place because of yelp and was not disappointed . i got the chicken and waffles as recommended by the server . it was delice ... . now , the space is not much in the way of ambiance . it is the typical strip mall food spot with seats , spartan look and feel and pretty clean . but the waffle types and combinations and the bubble tea 's make this spot worth a special visit . if they upgraded their establishment and made it a bit more fun/creative/upscale , this could then be a 5 star ... .	580
1	got a standard red door facial here . great atmosphere- relaxing , friendly staff , clean and upscale . skin looks great the day after my facial- extractions removed acne , no peeling or recovery and skin is glowing . got a scalp , face and hand massage during my `` facial '' , which was a nice surprise . little pricey , but will definitely return !	154
0	worst starbucks ever ! ! ! ! the wait time is always crazy here no matter what time they only have one person working , they are always out of the baked goods in particular the cake pops is what i like ... . so would not suggest this starbucks to stop into ... unless you have absolutely nothing to do and nowhere to be because you will be waiting .	1351
1	i have been going to bonital dental for 2 years . dr batoon and her staff are great ! they do a great job of helping me to feel comfortable for a routine check-up , whitening or having a cavity filled . thanks bonita dental for doing such a great job !	3099
1	i did n't think to check the reviews but luckily these guys are great ! double shuttle was a little annoying but we were in no rush so that 's ok . shuttle driver is chatty and gave us recommendations on things to see on our drive out to arizona . we were served by jessica - she was an absolute doll to deal with , we had a lovely chat as she processed the rental and ended up upgrading our car . yes you get full insurance + fuel pushed on your but you can easily opt out of that if you wanted to .	3576
1	get the honey garlic chicken wings and poutine special . it 's amazing ! wait time is about 15 min only cause they make it fresh .	810
1	i love their e-liquid and have never had a problem here ... .but it 's also because i went in and had some experience with `` vaping '' under my belt . if you want someone to give you the tutorial about e-cigs , do n't go here . but the e-liquid is the best in town .	2715
0	absolutely abysmal . this is the most poorly , and unprofessional business , that is a national brand , i have ever experienced , ever . children could run a better business .	1456
0	besides for the excellent amenities , i have had a terrible experience with the staff . breanna in particular was condescending , rude and completely dishonest when it came to keeping her word . psa to any current or potential gym members , i suggest you ask to deal with a different manager . such a shame because equinox is truly a beautiful , clean gym , but the staff are driving it into the ground .	757
1	for some reason last spring i was unable to make it to the festival at all . let me just say it was a long year waiting to hit it again . went the other day and enjoyed the most appetizing greek food . seriously no complaints here . food just does n't get any better . in fact i 'll say the fare runs circles around many restaurants serving the same items . the rain is pouring today but that 's not going to prevent me from going back one more time . today i 've got gyros on the brain !	2361
0	supper pricy $ $ $ $ $ $ no free water even for your meds ! ! i had to take my antibiotic and they would n't give a cup of water they charge $ 1 plus for water ! ! it 's against the law to charge for water for a patient taking medication . but they do n't care ! ! she said we are in hotel and we are $ $ $ and no free water ! !	3690
0	waited for over an hour . i was skipped over 4 times because the barbers took in people they knew before me . never going back again .	1689
1	this is a great nordy 's . not huge and does n't compare with the seattle or bellevue stores , but respectable . the men 's dept has a reasonable selection and a great canali area . service is great but hard to find . small home store selection is a great add .	1907
1	i love dottys the bartenders are the best and i 've won 2 jackpots ! ! they even have food ! !	1066
1	ok , first off this place was a hidden gem in that it was so hidden i walked past it twice before i found it . the decor was your contemporary modern vintage design with the beloved theatre sign as their menu top picks . the food was good although a fair warning that it was quite spicy ! i would definitely go for the spicy sizzling plate if you are with a group . the only thing kind of put us off was that their server felt like she was rushing us the time we were there . while i love a good seared mackerel , their portion was surprisingly small and so if you are ordering it , make it for one !	688
1	we hung out at this lounge during happy hour and got 2 drinks for the price of 1 . the drinks were very good . it was not busy at any point when we were there . they made good drinks and you ca n't beat the price during hh . there are tvs at the bar and we sat at the bar the whole time . would come again next time i stay at monte carlo hotel .	2634
1	i have been coming here for a few weeks and i love it . the staff are really friendly and everything is clean . the payout is good to help out with gas or some bills . i will definitely keep coming here .	1753
0	i would agree with review from 1/20/18 . i 've gone to this theater for many years and the past few months have been horrible . usually just one person at the ticket window . only one side of concession open . long lines . a friend and i went to a movie this afternoon . it was raining . one box office window open . probably 75 people in line , all the way to the parking lot . took 20 minutes to get to the front of the concessions . this theater is grossly understaffed . we barely made it to our movie as it was starting when we finally got to our seats . very disappointing .	3680
1	their website says they take appliances and scrap metal . i called and they picked up our dead appliances and scrap metal within 24-hours , just as promised .	2302
1	my wife judy and i were in vegas this month for the wcc tournament and were looking for a well rated thai eatery . we loved this place , friendly wait staff and cooks , and the food was heavenly . we ate lunch here three times during out six day stay , and every dish was a delight , and spiced just as ordered . i can hardly wait for my next visit , it was a wonderful treat for us .	1203
1	susan is an amazing stylist ! not only is her work impeccable but she is also very friendly . i only go here for my eyebrow needs . goodbye waxing !	3016
0	my sister and i have been here a total of 3 times . the first time an older lady messes up my eyebrows , tooooo thin . the second time , i had a younger girl who 's name was rhianna ( sp ? ) who did a great job ! and now the third time , my sister went and the older woman butchered her eyebrows , after she had been patiently growing them out . she said she was just going to `` clean them up '' and `` keep the same shape '' and she did neither ! we are not fans of this worker and probably will not be going back when she works .	2986
0	after seeing my review , this company contacted me to try rectify the situation , which is commendable . it was my choice to not bring my vehicles back again , though , since i just would question if the work would be done correctly this time . i have increased my rating due to their efforts .	469
0	have been using veyo for a while , rotten service . lately when i telephone they are having problems . not reliable , sometimes have to wait close to an hour to get picked up	1232
0	very bad experience . server spilled sauce all over coat . waitress told us to clean the coat and the owner would pay the bill . after many many revisits to the restaurant the owner has still not resolved . in fact he became very rude . we do n't need owners like that . would have probably been happy with a sorry . i would never recommend going to this restaurant .	688
0	sunglasses were stolen out of the glovebox . the onsite manager and kids that washed my car gave me attitude about it afterwards . cops came . still no sunglasses . best part , their corporate vp offered me free car washes as the `` best they could do '' even after admitting to me he 'd never go back to a place that stole from him ! avoid full circle car wash at all costs ! ! !	3899
1	the einstein bros. bagels at the corner of decatur and sahara is the location my wife and i go to most often . this store is generally far less busy than other locations around town so getting a table is almost never a problem . the staff does a good job to expedite your order so the wait time is generally pretty short . i do n't want to spend time talking about the bagels because i 'm sure most everyone on the planet has had them but this location will save you the wait and seating hassles of locations like summerlin .	1214
1	we got hosed by the rental companies at the gateway airport . chris took us , his cab was clean , great conversationalist , and safely got us to our hotel . no complaints . i 'd use them again .	3142
1	we went there three times during our recent trip to toronto . the food is quality pub fare and the beer selection is great . television is not intrusive and background music is quality jazz . everyone was very friendly and the service was great .	1091
1	i would recommend this company to anyone looking for top quality work and material . they are a local company and are very knowledgeable .	1593
1	i love this location . it 's in between work and home so going through the drive thru is easy . the only downfall is that they always run out of cold brew and food items .	1040
1	stay here because flight was delayed . staff was nice . beds were comfy . being from cali ... .. i heard nightmare stories of bed bugs in cleveland ... ... no bed bugs here ! which was a relief .	1979
0	i 've been here on a couple of occasions and have been very disappointed . the tall black guy who works in the men 's clothing is extremely rude and unhelpful . he is very selfish and does n't try to help . little did he know i was ready to buy several high end items . if he actually took a genuine interest in helping customers instead of only himself he would sell a lot more clothes . i went to nordstrom and prada instead and gave them my business .	485
1	first time in , and we will be back . juicy and crispy bone-in chicken , but the boneless was a little dry . coming from the midwest we miss chicken places like this . so glad to have found it .	862
0	this store has some cool stuff , but it 's pretty pricey . i know it 's local stuff , but i feel like i 've seen the same stuff cheaper elsewhere . my biggest beef is that the staff is too cool for me . i know they 're hipsters selling hipster stuff , but c'mon . it 's like i 'm not even cool enough to enter the store ? ?	1378
1	the best car buying experience . my salesman , mark mundy , went out of his way to show me all the options and weigh the pros and cons of each to help me make an informed decision . he was helpful , knowledgeable , and friendly . i got a great deal , and i am still in love with my car .	2851
1	a diamond in the rough ( i.e . scottsdale ) . the furniture makes it feel like your having a drink in your grandma 's basement ... and it works ! very cool . they sell mad dog 20/20 in the bag ! how kewl is that ? and the pizza 's great .	180
0	abuelo 's is like a toned-down chi-chi 's , or about what you 'd expect from a strip mall restaurant . our server was a pro and the corn chips were light and tasty , but most of the food was slimy and bland . this is a good destination for a big , rowdy family because there is plenty of room for kids and the menu is very un-affronting american . it 's a shame that this chain-style of restaurant dominates the dining landscape of our country .	1094
1	my roommate and i found a groupon ( still available ) and we thought we would give it a try . i was skeptical of the pizzas because they are not traditional in most ways . give them a try ! pizza was amazing ! i only wish they had another location . the 7th street market closes around 7 . other than that they were fantastic !	809
1	does anyone know when tickets for the arizona taco festival go 1/2 priced for the 2015 year ? ?	1392
1	came here for their grand opening . i think it went pretty smoothly ! i got a mix in of the fruity pebbles with fruity pebbles topping in a drip cone . it was really good ! and also a strawberry matcha latte . i was a little disappointed with the latte only cause i feel like i did n't get much of the strawberry purée . i love the concept though !	3051
0	this property failed to protect a tenant who was attacked by another tenant . they evicted the victim and the attacker . you guys failed big time . please do n't rent here , your safety depends on it	3436
0	i love sonic ... but this location has an issue with their slushies . i visited a few months ago and was disappointed when the slush tasted off - like their water filter needed to be replaced perhaps . it tasted like our sink water more than anything else . they said they fixed the issue and we returned - and it was much better . visited today and experienced the same issue - slush tasted off . this leads me to conclude it 's an ongoing issue and i 'm hesitant to order another slushie or water based drink from them again . if it 's the water filter , ( or whatever it is ) they need to keep on top of the maintenance .	844
0	too pricey for too few exhibits . only the shark & reef tunnel was worth some part of the very pricey $ 20 adult & $ 14 kid tickets . parking is $ 10 whole day , but the aquarium itself does not take more than 1-1.5 hrs to complete . should add way more exhibits or reduce the prices .	706
0	same problems as others are commenting on . they want you to pay up from , then they will bill your insurance , and when they are proven wrong then they will issue a reimbursement which takes anywhere from 3 days to 3 weeks ( depending on you paid up front ) . also the reimbursement process wo n't even start until you show them they were wrong and ask for the refund . horrible customer service . if you want paid in advance or at time of service then submit the claim immeadl	188
1	first time that i rented from avis at mccarran . good bunch of folks . they treated me right . what a break from the dollar rent a car types ! already booked my next rental ( at lax ) with avis .	3129
1	nice environment and typical korean restaurant . the only issue is they only accept debit card and credit card on $ 20 or above , which means it may be not convenient to pay aa .	396
1	just finished my visit here today . my tech was tammy , she did a very good job . the place is in a bit of disarray as they are currently remodeling . being that we just moved here and i am on the search for a new pedi place , i think i 've found it ! i got the infinity pedi and after that was completed she repaired my broken nail & went on to give me a mini mani . upon completion of this service she went on to give a small shoulder and neck massage . by the time i left here i was extremely relaxed and very happy with both my pedi and mini mani . i will definitely be back .	2297
0	this place is gross . very dirty and nasty . smells bad and is just overall very poor quality . we drove far too come here because pics looked like a fun place but mouthinglike what you see . i recommend mason the drive to flip side it 's the best kid and adult place we have been to . sorry jambo but i hope you get replaced with a higher quality place .	3791
1	the staff was extremely helpful and positive upon my arrival as a new patient ! they made me feel very welcome from start to finish and i will definitely be returning for my next adjustment and would recommend this location to anyone seeking a positive experience with chiropractics , especially if you are unfamiliar to the practice of chiropractic . dr. mcintosh made sure i knew what he was doing , why he was doing each adjustment , and how it benefited my overall health . again , highly recommended to anyone !	2011
1	it 's a nice little play centre and very affordable . when i was there with my 5 and 1 year old it was pretty quiet and they had a good amount of toys for the younger ones . overall i find it a little small for my 5 year old but ideal for my 1 year old .	3382
1	love happy dog ! they have a great beer selection ( including downtown willoughby 's peanut butter coffee porter on draft ! ) , awesome hotdog toppings , friendly staff , and great music ( shout out to polka happy hour with dj kishka ) . i always have a hard time choosing what toppings to add to my vegan dog and normally pick the first 8-10 that come to mind . no matter how many you choose , it 's only $ 5 ! this is one of my favorite places to take my out-of-town friends when i want to show them how awesome cleveland is !	1407
0	older tech . no digital x-rays . crowns take longer . definitely needs upgrades . my first crown ever was here so i did n't know what to expect . the crown did n't feel normal for a year and a half . they said it was normal . crown failed a year later during an exam where they said there did n't appear to be anything wrong , and then it popped out . now they want me to pay full price for a new one . the quote is almost 1.5 times what my current dentist charges , and they are using better materials ( and have a more modernized office ) . i would highly recommend using a different dentist .	2246
0	worst experience ever ! ! complete run around by staff ! i 'm endanger of losing my earnest money deposit because of their inefficiencies and lies . never been lied to by any company as much these guys ! ! do yourself a favor and take your business else where , wish i 'd read the reviews first . been a member for 15 years .	1668
1	had a great experience here from right when i walked in and was greeted by chenelle the receptionist who has the best personality and always do happy and helpful to all the staff . i had a facial and i loved it . had botox treatment as well . the doctor was great and i was happy with the results and i am also not getting any more migraine headaches i would definitely recommend anyone to go here ! ! ! !	306
0	i really do love bolt fresh bar . i 've gone there a few times but did n't notice how expensive the parfait is esp the coconut whipped cream . $ 14 for a parfait ? not going to be coming back for that anymore sadly . parfait is small for that price and coconut whipped cream is to expensive for the small amount they give you .	9
0	still inadequate number of scooters for disabled , none working , despite emails and speaking to store manager some while ago . store is multi storied , so disabled need scooters . surly cashier on my visit to the store on 24th june 2014 . this is a penny pinching store , like all loblaw 's stores ... .store charges for bags ; bags thrown onto groceries , but cashier makes no attempt to pack the goods purchased into the bags ... hopefully target will get their act together , and other stores like walmart will provide the competition this store sorely needs to jack up its act ...	1665
0	i 've used this warranty company for years and i was frustrated with how they would n't repair things when they were not `` installed properly '' even they did a inspection on the house before i signed up . now they are charging $ 600 some dollars to replace the water heater at my rental due to `` other costs '' . $ 600 is enough to buy a brand new heater and installed by a plumber ! i am switching warranty company to fidelity home warranty where if you get comprehensive coverage , they would repair things that were not installed property . hope fidelity wo n't disappoint me : )	3653
1	i own a condo here where we are snowbirds . i enjoy the fountains , plush grounds and most of all the location . the amenities are excellent from the putting green to the complete gym . the place is well maintained and clean and offers a couple of good restaurants . when i read some of the disparaging reviews i wonder how they have that perspective . the place is full of hipsters as well as old people . all and all ... a very nice place to live !	1205
1	this is our 2nd time we have been here this year . christina & murna at the desk where you get your parking pass are awesome . they remembered us from over a years time and past stays . i love this place .	1057
0	unable to diagnose simple illnesses such as bronchitis or a sinus infection on 4 separate visits . also , prescribed ( not sure how ) a compounded thyroid medication that put my spouse in the hospital with atrial fibrillation due to , according to the cardiac doctor , her thyroid levels being off the charts high . not recommended at all .	1896
0	i came in one afternoon when it was slow hoping for some decent `` sweet water '' ( cantonese sweet dessert ) . man , i was totally let down . old school types like myself prefer high quality ingredients , which often require substantial `` prep work '' . for me to give a thumbs up , the prep work must show thru . aroma , consistency , subtle flavoring , and freshness via small batches are all paramount . to me , this is a very generic bubble tea type of quick fixing very common in a typical asian mall .	1062
0	tipped way more than anyone else for a song and nothing . do n't ever tip more for a song . tip crappy $ 1 for a song never tip more for a song . they 'll never play it . they 're not good ! ! ! terrible bar	1176
1	excellent , small and nice . service and food was a1 . definitely going to be a regular . near parking lot	240
1	love this deli and it 's walking distance from my place . lucky me . they serve a great breakfast and lunch with all the traditional classics you 'd expect from a ny style deli .	325
0	food , okay..service , less than..other patrons , rather sketchy..drinks were poured well for decent price..might go back when i 'm packing..	696
0	music is too loud , way overpriced and they never do the same thing twice ! i would never let any friend of mine go to this `` salon ''	300
1	if you have to go and check your kidney function at least be reassured that these professionals will take good care of you and be very thorough . admittedly , i was scared to have to deal with this check up but , truly , the doctor was understanding , willing and ready to explain everything and seemed to instill well being .	2845
0	we waited 15 minutes to get our first order and then waited for another 40 mins for our shaved milk ice and the restaurant . never have i had to wait for a dessert that long . the server also did not show interest when we ordered . absolutely disgusted on how slow the service is . 1 star for now until they start to serve their customers with respect .	176
1	customer service is great ! very friendly staff and you are in and out . i love the products , we know there is no magic pill or injection but it 's a great boost to help you with your weight loss . i 'm happy and sticking to it !	2168
0	well ... this place has two strikes and we are strongly inclined not to take our dogs back . one time , our dog came home with a cut on his eye . it 's possible it was n't the groomer and that it happened during rough housing ( we have two dogs ) . it did n't seem to bother him - but it was clearly there . then again recently , they never called us when our two dogs were done being groomed . we called and they told us the dogs had been done for hours . they needed to go to the bathroom badly ! just a general level of carelessness that 's not okay for two loved family members .	2437
1	i have never been to a strip club before , and i am so glad this was my first experience ! i am hooked ! the guys here are so nice and so . fckn . hotttt . it 's been a week since i went and i 'm still daydreaming about that night , it was amazing . it is definitely entertaining and the guys put on a really good show . if you are in vegas for some fun , you definitely have to stop by at least one of your nights . it is so worth it ! trust me ! the guys will not disappoint . we 're already planning our next visit . : p	5
1	great place to get away and drink a cold beer . great atmosphere to hang out with friends i recommend it if your in the area .	1520
1	here 's a confession . i have n't even tried the cupcakes . however , i have found myself getting to cakes on walnut as they open ( 7am ) for the certainty of acquiring one of their delicious cinnamon banana walnut muffins . it should be noted that their blueberry muffins are delicious artful baked goods in their own right , but the walnut is indeed something to write home about . said muffin topped off with a french press coffee is the best way i 've found to talk myself out of the house in the morning . p.s . their internet never seems to work but i find you can steal it very reliably from somewhere else .	3749
0	had a craving for an opera cake -- it is my favourite cake , so i 've had at least a few hundred opera cakes in my lifetime -- and ordered one from jules . must say that it was the most disappointing opera cake that i 've ever had . it did not look like a proper opera cake and did not taste like a proper opera cake either . in fact , it was closer to how a tiramisu would taste than an opera cake . this is the only thing i 've purchased from jules so far . but given how disappointed i am , i will not be coming back .	397
1	i grew up in brooklyn and now live in california . every time i go to scottsdale i load up on the only bialys that are like those in nyc . they are the best . last time i bought 4 dozen bialys and 3 dozen bagels . when i got home i cut them in half and froze them . i love this place .	325
1	came in for a couple of drinks while waiting on a delayed flight . uptown manhattan . it 's just okay but service was nice .	1400
1	aderra is in an awesome location and has been a great place to live ! your just around the corner from o.h.s.o , salty sow , iron chef , trader joe 's , whole foods , sprouts and more . there is definitely a sense of community here , and people take pride in where they live . the complex itself is very relaxed and quiet . the units/buildings are well built and the underground parking keeps your vehicle safe/cool year round . everyone down at the office has been super nice and helpful , all around a wonderful place to live !	3475
0	thai mix ( red curry ) i dont know what this is but it 's not thai . bland and not even similar to thai red curry . if you want thai food hit royal thai grill or thai rama . i would have been better off going to panda express which makes me cry a little on the inside .	474
1	i 've been going here with my fiancé for about 5 years now and we both love it . the food is delicious , the all you can eat is great , and the staff are friendly . my only comment is that sometimes water is n't filled up even when our cup is on the edge of the table and we have to flag someone down a couple times . other then that love it ! !	1362
0	generally speaking , the food is good here , especially the caramelo . i decided to get a side of chips and guacamole this time around . chips were ok , but had old , crunchy french fries mixed in with them . and the guacamole was obviously a few days old and had waaay too much salt in it ! i 'll stay away from those items ... if i come back .	593
1	came to vegas for the weekend to look for apartments . front desk staff were friendly and the check in was quick . our room was clean and great !	3772
0	eyebrows waxed and my skin was peeled off my eyelids . probably will leave me with scares .	3635
1	customer service here is awesome ! my car was repaired quickly and at a reasonable price . they have my business .	2040
1	he has been my optometrist going on 3 years now . his fee for an eye exam and contact lens fitting was reasonable considering that i did not have vision insurance . even with having vision insurance now , i am still returning simply for the fact of the great service i receive each time . his office is quite busy as he is the only optometrist and the office is very small but they always find a way of accomodating walk-ins . i definitely recommend this office and will continue to go here .	2469
0	have been to other locations before and loved it , so i thought i would try this one . my son has a different hairstyle than most boys ( surfer shag type ) and many hairstylists have messed it up tragically before , so when i called to make an appt , i asked who would be best to cut his hair ... ... considering they had no idea what i was talking about , i wo n't be risking trying them out .	260
1	after a long day of working with bothersome children , i sought out for a satisfying dinner . this is exactly what i found . my experience began with timely service and a cordial waiter , who suggested some killer mac n ' cheese bites ! the `` bites '' were delicious , whereas the wings were simply average . the wings were n't exotic , nor unique , nor anything that exceeds mediocre . however , my overall experience warrants a solid 4-star rating . if i ever find myself meandering along aurora road , i will be sure to stop by again !	496
0	called 2 days in advance to book a shuttle for my parents . driver confirmed the address , pick-up time , and gave us a quote . the driver never showed up and never called to let us know they were n't coming . do not use this company ! !	1814
0	very bland and boring food . definitely not a place i would come back to . over priced as well .	548
0	worst customer service and horrible quality i 've never had my nails look so bad and that 's besides the fact that he nipped my skin about 6 times hurt so badly and would just keep going never will i return	1838
0	we have been going to this facility over a year now with lot of coach changes every couple of months without any notification but for the past month the front desk lady is so rude not saying hello or anything just staring at you .. we liked our coach but no one is telling what happened to her or if she comes back or not .. my kid screams now with the new one .. never seen any manager or higher up .. quality is declining every week.. will not recommend this place	2521
0	beware . these people are swindlers . failed my car on the safety inspection , citing among other things , that the wiper blades needed to be replaced , when just three weeks prior , i had them replaced with brand new bosch wiper blades . another fault they found in the car which i found ridiculous : the battery was not secured `` properly '' - as if it is going to fly through the hood while i am driving ? is this really a safety issue ? attempts at deception and trickery to make a dime . insulting .	3197
1	i 've heard about this place for many years but never really had the opportunity to try it until today . i was very pleased with the pizza very good i have n't had a thin crust like that in a long time . awesome toppings , they have those cool little pepperonis . quick service . my only quarrel is weak menu , i guess keeping it simple , makes it easy . i 'll update you when i try the one in bethel park ! bonus : they have cans of cherokee red how cool is that ?	900
1	stopped here a few times for a caffeine fix while staying at ny ny . the staff was very helpful and accommodating my weird drink requests . i 'm from ohio and we have something at starbucks there that this one had never heard of . but they did their best to match it and it turned out great ! the ladies that were working at the time were very friendly and helpful .	3558
0	despite their fantastic reviews , i had a horrible experience with victoria . due to what my gynecologist called poor technique i received a burn and skin tear after a brazilian wax , leaving me with vaginal skin pain for 4 weeks which required me to seek medical attention . to make matters worse , i contacted the salon to inform them i required medical attention after their service and was completely dismissed , never heard back from the owner or waxer . as a meek attempt at an apology the receptionist told me the owner would not refund my service but would offer me a free follow-up service , yeah right , never going back again .	3140
0	the technicians at this salon move like turtles ! unless you have nothing but time to waste ; pick another salon ! ! !	1440
0	i came here months ago to see interstellar and it was a decent theater . i just saw a movie here last night ( jurassic world ) since i was in the area on my friday night . this place has fallen hard . it was dirty inside . the concessions were dirty . the theaters were smelly and the seats were worn . i do n't know if it 's just a small theater or if they chose to put the newest release in the smallest auditorium because there were not enough seats at all . also , the ac was broken , which after reading other reviews i see is a common occurrence there .	3680
1	your typical city-esque pharmacy in the heart of downtown pittsburgh . a little dirtier , busier , and tighter than something you would find in the suburbs , but it does the job nonetheless . an extra star for the exceptionally kind pharmacy tech behind the counter .	1928
0	horrible service and lousy lottery system . they seem to give the resellers all the info and not the real people who want to adopt . we will buy from a breeder now . do n't go and have your kids day ruined by there horrible practices .	3626
1	still the best place for thai food in town . been coming here for 20 years . do n't be fooled by the location and the shopping center . it 's a delicious classic !	1361
1	great location . always fast service . i especially like how this location has 2 drive thru order lanes , so 1 person does n't hold up the whole line . they 've always been personal with me , unlike other places that just treat you like a number . they always get my order right too . these may sound like basic things , but you just do n't get them at other places . they do what they promise , and that 's what matters !	1023
1	look no further for a dollar store if you 're in liberty village - you can find a lot of things at your dollar store with more - it 's at least on par with the average dollar store in terms of the variety of items and selection . the staff has always been welcoming and helpful with me . i think the prices are relatively close to what you would expect to find in a dollar store , despite being located in primo liberty village .	2048
0	really really like the nail tech but every time i come here i have an appointment and have to wait 30 minutes . what kind of customer service is this ? come on people . do n't over book or take walk ins when you have appointments . very frustrating as i do n't have time to waste . also they just decided to change their prices and charge me more for the same exact service i 've been getting the past few months since they opened .	3425
1	nice little bar in las vegas with good service and they pour heavy drinks . be nice to your bartender people !	1389
0	terrible service and understaffed ! waited with two other couples who said they had been there 10 minutes just for a host ( bartender ) to approach us . finally got seated after the sushi chef cleaned our table and waited 10 more minutes and no one said a word to us before we decided to walk out . would have loved to try the food but seeing many other dissatisfied customers we decided to go elsewhere .	973
1	mike and his crew are awesome . they did an amazing job on my pool for rock work , water fall , and a water slide . he also built an amazing built in barbecue and decks . our house is the talk of the neighborhood . if you need anything done in your back yard that has water in it , mike and his crew are the ones to use .	2229
0	first time i 've been here in years and such a disappointment . supposedly they recently changed management which does n't sound like its going well . the food was not cooked fully and had flakes of black stuff from the grill . the soda was horrible ! they could not get the carbonation right.. ended up with juice since the soda was so nasty ! ! !	346
1	best mall in oakville . hopedale , or `` south oakville center '' is for the elderly and bronte village is just depressing . oakville place really makes me feel like i 'm better than those in a lower wealth tax bracket . 50 $ for a pair of gloves ? no problem ! i 'll use them to point and laugh at those who ca n't afford them ! my two kids feel really entitled when they enter this mall , and that 's a great thing to teach kids - entitlement .	3212
0	i understand that this restaurant is very busy , but i 'd rather eat at the food court rather than wait 45 minutes for each meai only to end up with a cold dish ( i ordered the paella ) . i also found it also unprofessional that our waitress and her friend were counting their tips in front of us . i really enjoy the desserts here though , and one order can usually be shared with two people .	534
0	we requested the visit early in the morning , it is past midnight and doctor has not shown up yet ( even though we were told he would be here anywhere from 2pm-10pm ) if you really feel ill , go to a walk in clinic ! !	723
1	i always go to this vacuum repair shop because they have always treated me like family . when it came to repairs very honest and never cost me an arm and a leg . so when i went in this time my hubby and i actually purchased a rolls royce of vacuums because the owner has been so good to us . highly recommend this shop for repairs and services . they are so good i had to leave them a review .	1031
1	everything i 've had here has been very good ! the chocolate cakes was amazing.. great choice of macarons and good price . the quiches are also delicious !	284
0	rude owners . was almost going to buy a couple things but changed my mind after he felt the need to give me the evil eye and watch my move as if i was about to steal something . i was n't . left a bad taste , new going back .	3400
1	normally i would never write a review on a gas station but i had to today because of star . she is a manager there and she was very professional and helpful . she took the time to get me coffee and refill the creamer boxes . she was just very nice and courteous and i had to write a possible review . when someone does well you have to praise them . so i am .	2309
0	so disappointed . we 've seen tso three or four times now . this show was not the same . at all . seemed demonic rather than christmas-y . so sad ...	2968
0	convenient location , comfortable interior , vegan vibe service . we split the warm lentil/spinach salad on recommendation of server . just ok @ $ 10 , the lentils had a nice herbed flavor and had been simmered in a flavorful stock w some fried pita chips . the kung pao chicken was very wierd and not even close to expectation-more like bland spagetti sauce over noodles with peanuts and chicken w/chili oil for that lol `` oriental flavor '' -dish needs to be totally reformulated-chef/owner please google `` kung pao chicken recipes '' . will head to pita jungle next time . dr hummus : stick to your fine retail food products ( great baba , hummus , garlic pitas ) -you cook poorly .	1402
1	some of the other reviews got me pretty worried , but everything in the car rental process went super smooth ... the airport shuttle to/from the rental office , paperwork , getting my car , returning the car , etc . great experience and fantastic price ! btw , shuttle driver was super nice and friendly . only had to wait about 10 minutes for the shuttle to their office and got lucky that we did n't have to wait at all on the way back to the airport , even with our late-night flight .	3576
0	it is unfortunate that the lakewood village tavern is located next door to grafton street pub . comparing the two really shows off the village 's flaws . grafton street pub is a lot hipper , laid back , and over all less annoying . the village tavern is filled with hambone white hats ( seriously , who still wears those ? ) and hooknasties . it is a little dirty , too . they do serve food , which grafton street pub does not . however , would you really want to eat it ? it is a less classy version of the merry arts .	1115
0	the males that work there are always pleasant and nice , but the female manager is very hit and miss . sometimes she can be friendly but generally she is fairly cold and makes for an awkward exchange . they have a good selection of beers and prices are average .	3265
0	i 've called them and left multiple voice mails to exchange a 12x24 broken frame and they 've not called me back in a year i paid about $ 162 ! ! !	1284
1	six stars for this costco ! costco rocks as a general matter , but man , this is one great costco ! they have a killer selection , better than the average costco , and they really shine in wine , liquor , and cheese . plus , they have a great car wash. take the awesomeness of costco , stir in a bit of scottsdale fanciness , and you have the makings for a warehouse shopping destination that is frankly worth driving to even if it 's not the nearest costco to you .	1102
0	this review is for the pga tour grill express . yes , the `` to go '' option . i paid $ 11-14 for a chicken sandwich and fries . i think a mcdonald 's chicken sandwich would have more flavor . it took 15 minutes which seems like a bit long . i ordered the `` guacamole black bean chicken sandwich '' and it was like 1/4 teaspoon guacamole , black bean sauce and a grilled chicken patty and that 's it . do n't waste your time and money , go somewhere else in the airport .	369
1	old country fall apart , juicy meets smothered in saurkraut or whatever 'accoutrements ' for a price that is in the vicinity of $ 5 : fantastic . good butchery also goes on and you can buy assorted condiments from the old world that you may have a hard time finding at other establishments . courteous , polite , hard working , eastern european folk , who take pride in their craft . what more could you ask for in a sandwich ? i 'll have the spicy mustard , please . waka waka	1313
1	new owners here from new york . the salon is now called apple nails . people here are always friendly	1720
1	love how they take care of my pet reggae . hours are convenient . close to home . clean facility . would recommend absolutely .	1766
1	go there and ask for the chinese menu - in the back of some of their menus . order whatever sounds tasty to you . you will like it . they have some of the best authentic chinese food i 've had in cleveland . i have no idea why they do n't advertise it more . a gem if you know what to order !	1009
0	use to be a welcoming and family orientated ... new management you become a number and they start closing xgt classes.. seems to be about the money now instead of the people ... .. thank you brock for helping me lose 15 pounds and getting me stronger . i wish i had more time to lose more weight and get healthier .	3298
0	very inconsistent quality . my fiancé got a cold brew with sweet cream , and it was literally chunky cream . he tried to have them fix it but they claimed it was normal ... i never know if my coffee will be good or not .	3143
0	i was thoroughly disappointed by this place on many levels . i went here after seeing the good ratings on yelp but the food was average with small portions of meat and they did not have some basic things that should 've come with the meal . after finishing the main course i had some soggy baklava . i do not plan to return and would not recommend this place to anyone .	860
1	let 's face it , you are coming here to get smashed . what better way to get smashed than having 3 shots of everclear in your drink for just $ 15 bucks ? get the 190 octane drink and add +2 shots of everlcear ( for an extra $ 2 bucks , or $ 1 a shot ) . share that between another person and you 're guaranteed to stumble into your hotel room or get a great buzz before going to the club ! fat tuesday never disappoints ! ( they also have locations in other casinos like caesers too ) . the end of the drink is almost all everclear so it 's pretty much over for anyone who drinks it haha .	2528
1	i 've been a fan for years . i like the staff and the service . the wait can be long at times so bring along a book if you do n't want to read the magazines that they provide . it 's always clean and hygenic and the staff will work with you and cater to your needs as best as they can . they do provide free water and coffee also .	1716
1	excellent service , great authentic chinese food without having to drive to china town . highly recommend .	294
1	the bomb.com good beer , great onion rings , and killer hotdogs . very nice staff and i would recommend this place to a friend . when i asked what was good they did n't give me the generic answer of everything . they told me their onion rings are special and that they are .	953
1	had a great experience at arrowhead honda . bought a new 2018 civic hatchback and am very pleased with the vehicle . my sales guy ( zaid ) and the rest of the folks were quick , thorough and very friendly . i definitely recommend them . 5 stars ! thanks guys ! ~jt	2210
0	albertson 's has purchased all safeway stores and the changes they are making are going in a backwards direction . 1 . they removed all the self checkout stands - why ? terrible decision 2 . these are the chains that have confusing pricing . it looks like a sale , but wait , you have to buy 15 of this item to get the sale price . 3 . both stores are exactly the same now . just pick one because everything one store has , the same exact prices etc are in the other store 4 . this location has n't figured out how to stop the parking lot from being flooded for years . do something besides putting yellow tape up . idiots .	1097
0	we bought a groupon for 5 weeks of pool service . they did come weekly but it was a very subpar job . they never cleaned our pool walls and you could tell . they also never cleaned out the strainer baskets . we thought maybe we got bad service because we bought a groupon , but we were also looking to continue the service . needless to say we did not stay with them .	3479
1	every time i go in for one thing i come out with more ! ! from perfumes , colognes , make up and hair products . love this place . the staff has always been helpful and if they know something im getting has a special going with something else they inform me . the one thing i wish they would carry is kat vond line : ( will be back	2479
1	my two dogs oscar and ziggy had a wonderful experience today . both dogs came back healthy and happy ! ziggy is a very anxious dog and they made him feel welcome and comfortable . i will seem them again for their next exam ! thank you banfeild !	824
1	cool place to check out especially when they have an exhibit in town . way too pricey for admission but groupon hooks you up . paid $ 12.50 instead of almost $ 30 . suckas !	3891
1	moderately long wait , but what an adorable place ! got and split corned beef hash and the salmon hash and a bloody.. whew ! delish ! very different and yet amazing . great service too . need to come back and get the boozy milkshakes and the cake ! pro tip : free iced tea refills !	975
1	great place for breakfast or lunch . reasonably priced , good service , fresh well made food . what more could you want .	418
1	this review is written by my 6 year old son . `` the ice cream is really good and icy here . the twist is my favorite . also , the grilled cheese is pretty cheesy ! ''	953
0	watch this after fantasy , less interactive with audience , and not alluring at all . the only highlight is the robot dance performed by two men . maybe this what classic vegas should . but it is really not my type .	3069
1	what a wonderful place we just discovered for lunch . excellent food and staff . we will positively be back here again .	1193
1	this place has the best donuts in tempe ! their breakfast sandwiches are good and filling , with quite the variety . i highly recommend trying this place , especially if you have a late night donut craving .	3137
0	if i could give it less stars i would . we stayed 2 nights , and had to re check in each morning . one of our beds was made , the other was completely stripped with the sheets toss around as if the room was a forever 21 in a urban mall . and to top it all off , we got charged double for no reason . now i have to call after 3-5 business days and deal with more idiots to try and get my money back . stay there if you love modern styles combined with a staff comprised of lethargic morons handling your money and sleeping amenities .	3337
1	good quality pies . gluten free available . never had a bad pizza . last time we went in there were to many flies buzzing around .	1519
1	starbucks downtown las vegas 122 e clark has good drinks and very good iced teas the staff takes excellent care of their customers of 100 per cent bodacious	1996
1	good food , atmosphere and neighborhood gatherings . coffee is expensive . love the story slam !	1175
1	they gave me a solid quote and replaced my axels ! i needed new tires and they helped me price out good ones on the cheap . love it . 10/10 will be back .	2711
0	just no . hell no . not sure what health grade store is , but i sat down with my friend and could n't even get myself to drink a glass of water . i politely passed and watch my friend eat . food all the floor . old food and who knows what in the seats , floors and windows . the wait staff appears have no knowledge of personal hygiene .	241
0	i was told by the doctor that i had severe artery blockage and needed procedure done right away . after one month i did not have a confirmed appointment . the staff did not return my calls and i finally got sick and tired and went to another cardiologist . i do not recommend center az heart specialist .	1942
0	this place is the worst of both worlds - ghetto and expensive ! i guess the prices are typical of asian mall massages , at $ 1 a minute it could be worse . options are foot massage , or body massage at $ 1 minute in increments of 20 minutes .	2158
1	love to go there they usually have a coupons for an extra discount , but the most importantly is their hair salon . i go to parisa to get my hair done . she is simply amazing !	223
0	i had a parfait , and it was ok . the space was so cute , but that point is moot . 'cause the service was bad , and made me so sad , i 'll never go back , 'til they give her the sack . so , summarize , i had a mediocre , overpriced parfait , and the woman who served me was rude and crusty . way to live up to the queen west service stereotype , bolt ! will not return .	9
0	i would not come back here again . they say one thing and it 's another . they give you the run around . they 're more than happy to take your money but they have no idea what they 're doing . check your bill because they do know how to add charges on to it . if they did n't provide the service , they do n't know how to remove it . -- -- -- thank you patient care team but it should have been taken care of the first 3 times it was brought to your attention .	3292
0	went in 30 minutes before they close . i was told the fryers are off , and i can only get stuff that is n't fried . basically all that was left was the nasty chow mein from the bottom of the pan . i get that you close in 30 minutes , but what 's the point of even being open if all you have is old chow mein ?	1495
1	i have n't been here in years but i recently went for bowling with several friends . it was great until the score board froze and had to be reset completely . besides that inconvenience , we received three games in total when only paying for two . overall a good visit .	3378
0	the new car person they have dont know what is is doing on car take to a better shop the open lot car guy he is rude dont he not good with other poeple he lied too m	3851
0	i 'm absolutely disgusted , blatant disregard for tenants ' well-being . the management here needs to wake up and smell the roses !	3354
0	unprofessional & ignorant staff . older asian woman in front of me was checking out when a young female staff member came running up to stop her saying she was seen putting something in her purse without paying . hispanic male employee then arrived and confronted the woman as well and made her go thru her purse . all this was happening there in the checkout line . should have asked her back to an office area or someplace else . have had issues with this staff in the past . completely lacking in service & professionalism . will now take my business elsewhere .	2670
1	amazing customer service , i felt terrible for coming right at closing time , but the gentleman did not make us feel even worse than i already did for coming at this time . my daughter wanted their tenders . shout out to eric working nights for amazing customer service and taking our order at a late time . i feel so terrible for being so late but he made us feel just as important as any other guest .	862
1	this is the former sports and fitness gym . it 's a huge space with lots of equipment . mornings are the best time for me to go . from what i understand it gets very crowded around 5pm , which makes sense .	342
0	i used to like this pharmacy but there customer service is awful . they do not return phone calls , lie about cost , and tell you a medication is going to be delivered only to have it not show up in promised amount of time . i would use a different pharmacy if you have another choice .	3283
1	although officemax is a chain , i really like this particular store . the store is well-organized , clean and inviting . this location is my go-to for office supplies . i have recently started my own small business , and the employees here were very helpful in recommending basic supplies and answering my questions .	2022
0	as much as i 'd like to give a positive review , i did not find the powder nail process acceptable . using a drill to smooth the nails , dunking the nail into the jar of powder and finally using gel as a topcoat so your hands are still subjected to uv light . some of this may be my personal preference but the technician should not be placing the finger into the jar of powder and the reason some people do powder is to avoid the uv light .	3309
1	came in with a flat tire and was immediately served with great customer service . since my tire was salvageable they basically helped me at no cost . amazing service !	3860
1	we were very impressed with mark our salesperson . he answered all our questions and did n't pressure us at all . when we walked in the door there were several employees standing around and nobody asked if we needed help . we almost turned right back around and left . thankfully mark made up for there short commings . the delivery people were awesome ! did n't force anything thru the door and cleaned up after themselves . all in all it was a good experience and we would go back again . the only reason were not putting a 5 is because of the people right at the front entrance . first impressions ! !	2071
0	they use excellent wax but the girl who did my chin ripped off some skin : ( . they also have amazing organic products -- lotions , soaps , moisturizers , etc . it 's such a shame , i 'm just so disappointed with my service .	3140
0	do not order delivery here ! takes forever & the pizza got here not fully cooked ! sloppy doughy in the center . pile of grease . never again	1406
0	what a fantastic looking shop ! decor is fancy , two tv 's , very modern . what was incredible to me was the fact that my husband and i spent about 7 minutes walking around , looking at bikes and gear , browsing ... ... and nobody greeted us . not a nod or a `` hello '' or anything . we left . we did n't buy anything . oops ?	3513
0	i would seriously come and eat here all the time , however the bartenders and servers are some of the worst of all time . it 's like they hire random people off the street and give them an apron without any training . serious worst of all time	1311
0	relentless emails to have me come see the van i was interested in , nonstop phone calls to get me to make an appointment and then , ultimately , they used the old bait and switch tactic on me when i finally made my way up to the dealership . and to make this an even more horrid story , the car i am shopping for is to be used for a nonprofit organization . thank you , coulter nissan , for wasting my time . i will spread the word of this horrid experience as aggressively as you tried to pursue my business . stay away from this place at all costs !	394
0	just a update on my review the owner did contact me apologizing for the acts of his staff and again the food was delicious and the chef/owner was the best thing about this establishment !	57
1	i recently purchased a new stove , microwave & refrigerator and i could not be happier . as soon as i walked in i was greeted and not pushed clifton our salesman was great . the refrigerator i bought was bigger than what i previously owned and did not realize how big it was until it was delivered . i called the store to see if i could get a different one but after i looked at them at the store i decided to keep the one i bought and remodel the kitchen around the refrigerator . the only compliant i have is the stove was not leveled properly and i had to readjust the legs but that only took a few min to do .	3784
0	do yourself a favor , drive right by this place , turn east on baseline , and drive until you get to black bear diner on the south side of the street . bad food , bad service .	1029
1	was hoping to get a mitt to play catch with my son . went looking for the store and thought i walked by it . they ended up moving up the road a little bit to a bigger store . easier to see from the road as well .	2781
0	tourist trap . the production is really good , movie quality . but the puzzles are easy and they have the dumb flashlight that only works sometimes , which they say means it works when there 's a clue , but that 's bs . it 's meant to slow you down so their easy puzzles seem harder . this is not an escape room , it 's an interactive haunted house . it sucks if you 're experienced with escape rooms . do not recommend . plus , it 's really expensive . got ta pay those royalty fees to lionsgate .	1391
1	can always find good quality clothes especially when on sale for a steal . shouts out anna she is super helpful and nice !	2395
0	this racist bigot said he was disrespectful because he did n't like people of color and disrespected my sister ! ! ! please share that this business is overtly racist ! ! i find it ironic that he will accept the green , but disrespecting people of color with his racist gibberish ! !	1053
1	great spot ! food is always good , patio is lovely , and george & dora are always so very welcoming . definitely a recommended place !	1193
0	the barber ruined my hair . cuts hair unevenly . they get distracted watching tv and talking with each other leaving the customer unattended .	3574
1	i have had very positive experiences at this location . super nice service technicians who are highly knowledgeable and helpful . is it a little pricey for an oil change ? yes , but i am paying for the speed and convenience which is worth it to me . they have taken great care of my car and topped off fluids between oil changes for free as promised . highly recommend and will continue to return .	1093
1	one of the best compounding rx i have come across . very prompt response and kept lines of communication open at all times -- - highly recommend	1372
0	beware ! ! ! stay away . this company is very unprofessional . i attempted to rent a limo bus for them for a wedding . after multiple calls back and forth , we had agreed on a particular bus , was told the contract would be emailed over shortly . after not receiving contract , i called back the next day and spoke to someone else since the original lady was out of the office . i gave all my info again , date , time etc . second lady said she would have that right over to me . a week later , i finally get a email saying that it is no longer available .	455
1	i have been coming here for over a year now . i love this salon . jenny is my nail girl and does amazing nails . all the nail techs are great and are super friendly . i highly recommend this salon .	1429
1	the bubble tea was okay . but it was n't great . they added way too many ice for a small size bubble tea . and it was too bitter for my taste . but everything else was amazing .they are better alternative bubble tea places that are better . but the service is very nice so i gave 4 stars . i like bubble tea but unfortunately there is n't any other bubble tea places around danforth area.if you decide to choose a place to have the best bubble tea i recommend you go somewhere else . but if you are down for breakfast and coffee then this the place is a go .	2627
1	i 've played this course a few times and found conditions to be really pretty good , even through the summer ! it 's a fun course with fair challenges for an executive length course !	3070
1	i love regal phillips place theatre . it has always been the theatre of my childhood . recently , they have gotten 3 digital projectors . this is terrific due to the incredible difference in quality compared to the regular 35mm in the other 7 theatres . the employees are always very nice and helpful at anything that i need . regal crown club cards are always awesome because you save so much money with the somewhat ridiculous prices . i give my full recomendation to come out and enjoy a movie and escape at regal phillips place stadium 10 !	3680
0	response : your exclamation is totally in accurate so i called the company for a price quote to remove a kitchen sink and install a new kitchen sink and to use the existing faucet . the garbage disposal needed to be taken off and then placed back on . there was no major retrofitting of the drain coming out from the wall . a standard kitchen sink installation . my jaw dropped to the floor ! $ 3500 . so i was n't sure i heard him correctly . i thought perhaps he may have misunderstood me or i him . i reviewed what i wanted and he reaffirmed the price . bla hahahahahahaha ! ! ! be very afraid !	924
0	was n't terrible , but $ 7 for two cupcakes that tasted like muffins was not worth it . frosting was perfect but dry , dense cupcake was not .	1806
0	quality food , mediocre service , and horrendous price . the food here would have to be much more delicious , or a bit cheaper , or at least served with a little more attention to bring me back . meh all the way .	1441
1	they sell the fast-food they do n't seem to sell anywhere else . i like the cherry limade and the cheese fries . also , they are fast and cheap . when you feel like out-doing mcdonald 's but not really , this is a good place .	994
0	awesome to come to pittsburgh and find an ohio state bar . the problem is that you advertise on all tables 1/2 off appetizers and $ 4 labatts during all penguins games ( there is a pens game going on right now too ) but you do n't inform your staff that you 're not honoring it tonight because of the osu game ... yeah and we already ordered the specials . waitress had no idea . food is subpar at best . just not what we expected for the price .	2532
0	i just do n't understand the pinkberry hype . my husband and i were tempted by the salted caramel yogurt . while it was tasty , i was just not wowed by the selection of toppings or the price . i just know what i like . we were told we could have `` unlimited toppings . '' well , as luck would have it i chose these delicious looking milk chocolate crispies . the lady serving said they were $ .50 . so they essentially do not have unlimited toppings . i just prefer the self-serve method of yogurt where toppings are indeed unlimited and you can get as much or as little as you want .	3335
0	very pleasant staff and dining room . the food -- not so good . the flat bread is more-or-less like a trader joe 's pizza , good enough but not what i expected . the trout was dry and the couscous had way too much swiss chard . avoid the trifle desert .	918
0	thought i found a great new vet for my furry friend . but , alas , it only takes a rude vet to end this business relationship . not sure of her name but that 's irrelevant i guess . it 's a shame . everyone else was terrific . fortunately there are many veterinary clinics and we 'll find one that has nicer vets . better luck . cheers !	2864
1	came here with an upper respiratory infection and they treated me right away and made sure i was able to return to work as soon as possible . medical staff is professional and courteous and will seek to provide you with the best care possible . definitely recommend .	2906
0	horrible . they replaced my sprk plugs on suv . the next day they blew out . they said that `` it happens '' ( for 500 dollars it happen ? ! ) they said they would only pay to tow back but i had to pay to replace the ones that blew out again . what ! ? i complained to the bbb they asked for their side of the story , and after review they lost their bbb certification . dont be fooled even thought the sign says they still have it . cons .	2308
1	i received the best prenatal massage from selina . she took her time and paid attention to my concerned areas including the best head rub , she is only available sunday and monday 's i believe but so worth it . i recommend this location to anyone for the front office staff are just as great as the therapist . very friendly and organized , i wish i had kept my membership to continue at this location instead of cancelling due to the park west 's location .	3744
1	my most favorite watch has held up well for years . it only ever needs a link taken in/out occasionally and , of course , a battery replacement when it 's time has expired . ( pun intended ! ) i 've used m and i for both of these services . i 've left satisfied every time and will continue to do so in the future . the price is right and the staff is friendly and efficient . it 's also family owned , which also makes me a supporter of m and i . recommended to all !	2307
0	not good , not bad , this place is a fine choice if you 're looking for totally mediocre but plentiful food . that being said , i would not recommend the place to friends .	1575
1	their pho is usually very good , however there was once that they served pho with very salty soup broth that tasted different than before . sometimes when you come in to the restaurant there 's some fishy smell .	673
0	i had it done on thursday , on the 1st day they looked nice . but , the 2nd day they started clumping together , and a section fell out in the end of my right eye , it goes in a weird directions and the glue is so dry and hard that i feel like pine needles poke into my eyelids .	3360
1	this safeway has been here forever . great floral and produce departments and the lucerne brand cheeses are bomb from california ... due to high prices i like to do most of my shopping at fry 's or food city but i love my safeway for convenience and chit chatting with my neighbors .	2316
0	i went here for the first time for the glen jacinto event . there was a huge fight between the opening band and some of the audience . they evacuated the place but some people already left without paying . bad first impression . there was hardly any staff for a busy night and our food took literally an hour to get to us . the food was okay , nothing special . service was ok. what a disappointment . will not be going back anytime soon .	817
1	this place is so small but it 's busy which i think is great for a family run business ! the portions are huge ! i ordered a chicken greek salad and there was enough for two meals . my husband ordered fish and chips . the fish was large despite only being one piece and there were a tonne of fries . i would definitely go back !	652
0	been here 3 times now for birthdays , and each time has been awful . the customer service has consistently been slow and the staff never apologetic pricing for drinks is steep , and they do n't even have the quality of liquor you 'd expect given the prices . it has a pretty nice ambience , but it 's not enough to outweigh all the problems ...	634
0	had the owner of this store call me dumb , and was told to leave his store after i asked for help with a part-had the part # too ! spread the word-no shop ! https : //t.co/u7fhar8r2s	932
0	my debit card works everywhere but here , not sure why . they have recently raised their prices , i can now get a 60min full body massage for the same price .	1587
1	i 've been to three different places for a small part to my ro system . after a night of leaking pipes and destroyed hardwood floors i finally ended up here . steve handed me the part within 1 minute of arriving and when i went to pull out my money he told me merry christmas . it 's the little things like that that can change your perception on the entire crappy day i just had . i 'll be paying this forward and they just received a loyal customer from now on . thank you so much .	2558
0	bought a groupon for this place and they claim they know nothing of the groupon . scammers .	1360
1	the food was perfection , service was incredible , and the atmosphere could n't have been more perfect . jennifer , justin , and the rest of the staff made our 1st wedding anniversary absolutely perfect . the dry age beef was tender and delicious , second best steak of my life ! the fillet was well seasoned and cooked perfectly . we ordered the decanter of manhattan , definitely the way to go . best manhattan i 've had in charlotte .	481
1	karen langdon is the best provider ever ! she is super smart and addressed all my mom 's needs . she is very nice and compassionate and takes time to answer all my questions . my mom had never received such good care before . thank you karen	3349
0	worst experience i have had in a long time . we waited over 1.5 hours for our food . during that wait time , we saw numerous other diners receive the wrong food , have to ask for silverware multiple times before receiving any , all while the waitress kept bumping into me when she walked by me . we finally got up and left before we ever got served when the waitress brought out her friend 's food when he showed up 45 minutes after us . we will never go there again .	531
0	i 'm all about supporting my neighborhood business but this is one place we wo n't be returning to ! the froyo was very hard and ice like , the staff did n't really seem to be too concerned with the quality . it was a big waste and dissappointment	1903
0	this was the 3rd and last time we come here for dim sum . if you are not chinese they sit you at the back where the carts do n't come or the food is cold when it does . waited 15 mins for the first cart . service is poor and with the exception of the chicken feet which were great , the rest of the dim sum was mediocre and overpriced .	0
1	while looking for a new , fresh spot to do a working lunch ... we stumbled onto roots cafe ' . yes , it 's the same roots as the food truck ! the menu is farm to table , ridiculously fun mixtures of ingredients . i had the blat ( bacon , lettuce , tomato and avocado ) on fresh brioche with a side of corn salad . it was fantastic ! full of light and fresh flavors . my business partner had the veggie burger with a side of the cucumber salad ... . same reaction ! great vibe and friendly staff ! roots is officially on our rotation of local spots to enjoy !	308
0	go for the beer only . lots of good beer on tap at good prices . but everything else is terrible . the service was so bad we were speechless . the food was mediocre . veggies came out cold and food was luke-warm . kids mac-n-cheese was soup with noodles . they ran out of diet coke before we got there but it was still on the bill and the waitresses blamed the manager . but the beer was good ... if the food was good i would have looked past the service issues as that 's more the server , not the place , but we will not be back anytime soon .	211
0	eh we 've had better . way better . place looked liked a prepubescent teenagers bedroom - messy and dirty . drinks barely had any ice . over priced for what it was . wo n't be back .	490
0	servers are very rude and seem like they hate their job . i live upstairs in the condo beside , i 've been here a few times and servers pretend to not see you when you put your hand up . server rolled their eyes like i was stupid when i placed an order . i do n't recommend this place .	1290
0	when insurance required us to go to cvs this location was right near the vue making it very close to us . walking there was terrible as you had to pass homeless people panhandling you and they would hang outside asking for money outside the store . the store should have really called police to enforce the city ordinance which profits them from panhandling so close to businesses , atm machines or restaurants entrances . they did take away the picnic table so they may have been less inclined to stick around too long . still , felt unsafe walking and utilized the drive through , keeping windows rolled up when waiting .	3830
1	pedi alert ! what can i say . called ahead , did n't need to schedule , and on a saturday . in a chair and soaking within 5 minutes . lady was so nice and gentle , entire experience was very relaxing . was clean and professional . wish there was a little mood music , but i tend to play headphones . colors where not the largest selection , but for shopping nook salon , it was good . oh , and super cheap .	2830
0	the worst pedicure i 've ever had ! they did n't even scrub my feet good and the painting on my toes look like a 2 year old did it , they even missed a toe ! so disappointed , never gong back	1256
0	first time at this location in close to 10 years . had to have my last name changed from married to maiden ... the tech ricardo keeps calling me by my married name ( a name i have n't gone by in 2 years ) . completely disrespectful !	3805
1	i came in on a wednesday afternoon and i was the only customer in the store . mary is a soft spoken and kind woman who is happy to help you out in finding the correct size and style for your body . i tried on a couple of 40j bras in different styles that she kept giving me over the curtain . when i finally found one that felt right on my chest she came in and looked at the fit , confirming that it was correct . i 'm really happy with the new bra overall and the service that i received . it 's really nice to not feel like a bowling ball is sitting on your chest all the time .	357
1	tried the 6 services menu . presentation is great and food is very tastefull . i did not love the fact that the place is in the basement of the building and it is pretty noisy ...	783
0	it was ok the pictures on the wall were more exciting then he actual food i went on my daughters birthday thinking it would be something good to try i mean who does n't love waffles and it was so many	580
0	i would like to review the food , but unfortunately they didnt have any ! we live down the street from here and thought we would try it out since we have eaten here at the malls . it was 9pm and there were 6 empty bowls and a spoonful of food in the others to chose from . there were about 6 employees that appeared to be doing something , but im not sure what since they didnt have any food to offer . since i dont pay money for leftovers , we left and ordered food from golden lilly chinese . im pretty sure if you want to succeed as a business you have to have something to sell . good luck with that	1075
0	always horrible service and rude workers . plus the restaurant is dirty and the last time i was there , there were bugs everywhere crawling around . i would not recommend eating here .	221
0	i keep wanting to give this place a shot but it falls flat every time . the concept and layout of the place is really cool and they have a great menu however the products that you actually leave with are the problem here . a lot of things are frozen or bottled . they do n't use raw coconut water , they use vita coco ... i have found too that any juice or smoothie i have gotten has no flavor or is sour because they use produce that is n't ripe .	3223
1	great funky novelty popcorn . love the salt and vinegar popcorn and dill flavored popcorn ! ! solid 3 cheese popcorn as well . will definitely try more ! !	479
1	i 've been here on two occasions and so far love it . it can get crowded but the music is pretty good so ... ..its def a great party place ! ! !	2729
0	i am very disappointed with this new team that has taken over ! ! ! ! so unprofessional , very rude and presents misleading/false facts ! ! ! dr. kuiava is a well known dr . in the area ... i 'd travel all the way from aliante just for his care and expertise ! all of a sudden this `` new group '' comes in and tries taking over with a high clientele ... you folks are inconsiderate for informing us all that dr. kuiava retired ! learn how a business operates and maybe then will you get and earn the respect you seek !	2468
0	quality has deteriorated significantly . first time i visited this place ( year ago ) , the burger was very juicy and fries were crispy and spicy ! last weekend , i took my friends to this place saying all nice things about this burger joint . we ordered couple of burgers and fries and just after first bite , everyone looked at each other silently signalling that it was cold , bland tasteless and patty was burnt . felt embarrassed .	940
1	i can say that my wife and i are regulars here . we are not the kind of people that walk in and are like hi norm , but we do eat here about once a week to every other week . the food is always good , and the staff is always friendly and good at what they do . the few times that we have had issues they have always been taken care of . the portions are generous and i feel it is the best bang for the buck when it comes to sushi in scottsdale . i do eat at a few other sushi places in town , but this is my fave .	198
0	coffee was ok but the personnel was very socially retarded and rude and the food was not worth the money .	184
0	terrible service , waiter was extremely rude . waiter also snatched the menu out of my hand after i nicely tried to explain to that he explained the wrong dish to my friend . the manager came out and said sorry i 'm only part time i ca n't do anything . they also brought out my appetizer , after my entree already had came out for a while . do yourself a favor and do not eat here . this is my first yelp review and i ca n't honestly tell you this was the worst experience i 've ever had a restaurant .	961
1	i wanted to get a nose piercing and decided yelp would be the way to find a place . i am so happy i found halo piercing ! all the reviews that raved about halo are absolutely right ... it 's such a great place ... clean , great customer service , a variety of awesome jewelry and they have ana ! ana just made the whole experience so much better . she is talented , professional , fun , really cares , takes her time to get to know you and how you want your piercing to look . so happy i found halo and ana ... i would recommend this place to anyone looking for a piercing . thank you ana ! ! !	2895
1	man let me tell you i 've been to some car washes in my day , but mansion ave . car wash takes the cake ! my car honestly has n't been this clean inside and out in years ! ! i am surprised to read the negative review i just read because my experience was totally different ! the guys up there were very kind and fair with the price ! keith especially was very kind and i could tell takes passion in his business ! ! anyways i would suggest going in and checking it out for yourself ! 6star in my book ! !	416
1	i could not have been more impressed with my experience at sunnyside honda ! i needed a new car , but needed to be economical and get out of my beater . my sales consultant , vida brown , was fantastic . he was courteous , knowledgable and honest ! i got a great deal and never felt pressured . the managers were very friendly as well and my finance lady , jaqueline was very good . she put me at ease and made the whole process simple . this is what buying a car should be . it felt different than any other place i shopped at right from the get go , i love my new civic ! thank you sunnyside !	3074
1	amazing food ... the presentation , quality , taste and portion size are perfect . comfortable , easy going atmosphere with fabulous staff . we have gone several times including the last two new years where they kindly accomodated our vegetarian diet .	638
1	i used to find the bay completely overwhelming but lately i 've turned into quite a fan . a great selection of bathing suits and i love the calvin klein stuff and the whole floor of shoes . i also find the sales people at the clinique counter to be very helpful ( and always giving me free facials ! ) . i recently took my teenaged 'little sister ' here and she pronounced it her new favourite store after we were able to knock off her entire camp list in 2 hours . the best part ... .there always seems to be a sale !	2979
1	great service ! comfortable limo with bottled water . they send u a text when they arrive and are right on time .	2952
1	although my order was slightly wrong , they remade the order and threw in extra add on . also fast and courteous . comparatively , i choose this location instead of windmill store because they have consistently slow /poor service . we 'll be back here .	844
1	i 've been here twice now and each time i 've been pleased with my experience . scheduling is easy , i was seen on time ( literally 2pm appt was a 2pm appt , which i truly appreciate ) . i like the cozy vibe of the office and the receptionists are friendly . i was treated by pa deb vu who was kind , caring , and attentive to my needs . i plan to see/ request her for any future needs .	3598
1	j'ai bien aimé les expositions . c'est beau visuellement et le matériel audiovisuel est sympathique . j ' y suis allée avec mon fils de bientôt 3 ans . on a fait le bricolage ( bracelet autochtone ) . j'avais l'impression d'être suivi partout par le chien de garde du musée . on m ' a interdit mon sac à couches sauf si je le portais par devant ! ? ! pourtant il y avait des gens avec des poussettes . je ne l'ai pas trop compris celle-là .	3847
1	great ice-cream everytime . we love the chocolate devotion . the brownie is to die for and the entire thing just melts in your mouth . the place does have a lot of turnover but they always manage to make the best darn dessert in town . always a good choice with the family .	3201
0	i ordered biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs . this is what i received . two over easy eggs with two sausage patties .	1319
1	the butter chicken was to die for ! it was so amazing , the lamb masala was good too but i 'm a bigger fan of butter chicken . naan was hot and fresh , and service was amazing , i 've never been so happy to tip ! the decor was also very classy , and the food was not over priced at all ! the best part was i dined with a groupon , so for $ 15 i got 2 dishes and naan bread , which is really great . i would be happy to return and i would not mind paying regular price at all , because even the regular price is quite reasonable .	889
0	i 'd give a half start if possible ! worst pharmacy ever , no communication between their agents . we were given a date to pick up , and on the day received a call to pick up a week later . they promised to call us when the medicine was ready . never received a call . then couple of days later i called back just to hear that my order will be ready in another week . i immediately cancelled my order and went somewhere else . avoid them as much as possible ! do not recommend . extremely bad experience .	1372
1	been wanting to try this place out for a while , but saw some sketchy reviews . so glad i came ! service was great , food ... even better ! ! i had the chicken fried steak & omg ! so delicious ! you will not leave this place still hungry . the portions are huge ! i will most definitely come here again . even my picky kids were satisfied with their meal .	1319
0	horrible service in less then a month of being a customer they missed 2 of my service dates .	2387
0	as much as i like target this location is the worst ! ! the clothes are always in a mess and checkout is ridiculous ! ! ! most of the time only one checkout open and slow ! ! ! ! ! managers sometimes stand in front but do not offer help !	583
1	this is the best department store ever the only thing they are missing is a large electronics section . they have wonderful brands , great customer service , a clean store and did i say great deals on the wounderful brands they provide ! !	2910
1	i did n't get a hot dog , but i did get the ice cream sandwich . i would give just the ice cream sandwich five stars ! the butter pecan and caramel cookie ice cream sandwich was recommended to me by the cashier . she did not lead me astray . two huge cookies with ice cream ( which was at least 1.5 inches thick ) . i would go back just for that delightful treat . i also got the chocolate malt , which was very good , but not great . everything else looked decent in the pictures , but i did not partake .	953
0	very very t dentistry not compassionate to elderly people would not recommend this place .	905
1	dr. liu is great ob dr. their office is very good service.i will recommend my friend and my family	1788
0	do not go here ! they overcharged me $ 15 and i did not notice this until i checked my bank statement . i called and talked to them multiple times and they never returned my call and ignored it . waste of time and money . would not recommend it .	1229
0	do n't go to this place if you want your nails to look like you let your 5 year old do them . the pedicure was alright and they do have good products but i will never go back . my fingers were butchered , ouch ! ! plus , he filed my nails and skin after the gel was dry.. very weird experience !	1637
0	ran into a rude host . have us a hard time and ugly looks because we wanted a booth . uncalled for ...	1504
1	dr. barry is one of the best doctors in las vegas . she has been so helpful with all of my medical issues , is very thorough and prompt . i feel she is brilliant as a person but also very down to earth . she has been my doctor for several years now , and i am grateful to have her as my health care provider .	2747
0	the pad thai tasted like noodles covered in ketchup , extremely disappointed after hearing such great reviews on yelp .	973
0	bland and cold the portions are what i expect from an all you can eat , small but respectable . all the dishes that should have been served hot were luke warm at best ( fried rice , chicken teriyaki , beef ribs ) . the white tuna with mango roll was the worst . rolls are normally served cold but this was not and the mango was actually a warm sticky mango sauce . nothing was fresh and that is my biggest issue . i expect fresh made food when i go to a sit down restaurant . very disappointed .	1231
0	pushy sales staff lined up at the entrance , just like stepping foot onto a used car lot . supervised browsing the whole time here . prices are competitive , but product does n't seem to be the same quality as some other places in the area .	3738
0	we had a rain check on a sale item and tried to use it yesterday and were told , `` we do n't honor those kind anymore . '' what ? what do you mean ? this particular harris teeter must have the worst management team ever . there are very good harris teeters in charlotte , but this is not one of them . ever since they opened they have been a disappointment . they are rude , unhelpful , and i can tell you this , unlike publix , shopping is definitely not a pleasure here . i think i 'll drive a little further and spend my money somewhere else .	1061
0	here now , arrived at 10:50 am , an although advertised as a breakfast/brunch place ... guess what ? no breakfast/ brunch availabe !	308
0	worst severs ever ! dishwasher broken takes a whole week to get some one to check about it ! need hand wash for 6 people 's dishes every meal ! they just saying nothing can do about it ! also swimming pool and the hot tub water supper dirty ! windows ca n't open , carpet really smelly , all cabinets super bad condition also really dirty ... so on ... update : yesterday went to swimming again , with 4 young kids , the pool water still super dirty and maybe even dirtier than before ! my kids love swimming , but with so dirty water we 're so scared to use the pool !	2832
0	a few of the instructors were good at teaching a class . but for the most part this school is a waste of time . the student handout materials do n't help out to much for getting ready for the exam .	2880
0	nothing special . margaritas are purely mix with no alcohol on the special nights . premade poured from a pitcher . food is ok but if you try to call in for take out or delivery half the items in the menu are not available . super disappointing . not many margaritas to choose from which contradicts the name .	651
0	food is good , lovely ambiance . but disappointed in cleanliness . during our second visit we were served a cup with lipstick on it . on the third visit , there was quite a bit of dried fruit next to the drinks menu . the waitress was justifiably grossed out and cleaned it up , but after the previous visit ... i think they could step up their game a bit .	670
0	this store gets one star specifically for the soul fact that one of the baristas made it his job to tell me that my beverage order was `` disgusting '' multiple times . guess what ? being in guest services for 8 years , i know better than to talk down to/about a guest or their order .	3396
0	when you change your `` guest policy '' without notification & charge on the first time for a 12 year old . `` there is nothing we can do '' . terrible customer service .	2699
1	always delicious . very generous portions . i love the kung pao chicken . delivery is fast and the food stays hot . this restaurant does an excellent job again and again . other oriental take out just does not compare .	945
1	absolute excellent hookah lounge , very chill ! great selections of music not to mention speakers do sound pretty good . also the staff is excellent love this place . keep up the good work guys !	1229
1	so having been back to vegas several times , i have had a chance to try this place again . it must have been the dishes i ordered because since then the food i 've had has been really great . instead of my usual gau gee mein and stuffed duck , i 've ordered the minute chicken cake noodle and pork hash . the cake noodle is just like home , and the pork hash is the best pork hash i have ever had at a chinese restaurant . super juicy and fatty - perfect on top a huge bowl of rice . i loved it so much , that i ate it twice over a three day trip on two different trips .	1103
0	this place is terrible ! the park smells and everywhere you walk there is pigeon and goose poop ! the play area is in need of repair . i am shocked this park is in aliante !	367
1	we had got in late on a thursday night and the main restaurant was closed ( hudson room ) but we went to cruisers bar and grill . the bartenders were great and the food was awesome . my husband and i shared the mac n cheese . it was awesome , and so was the side salad . i would recommend eating at this place regularly .	40
0	i have never been more upset by a haircut . it was 16 $ , and i thought i 'd tip 10 bucks ... really regretting it . straightened my hair for the first time since the cut and i 'm in frustration . she asked if i wanted layers , i said yes like a dunce and ended up with hair that 's just 3 different lengths in the front and the back is all the same length . i have a mullet ! ! ! ! ! i did n't cut my hair for 3 years because i was afraid of this . sad .	3281
0	horrible place . new management . the teen girl is embarrassed to work there so there is no eye contact nor did anyone hear me ask questions ... i was informed and then given a bill . first off talk to your customers ... .make sure all the fixans are what they want . sorry but i do n't work here ... .so obviously i do n't know how to make your solvaki pita . everyone makes their differently . i hate olives and i hate pickles so wtf . anyways never never coming back to this expensive sh*t ever again . zero stars . gross gross gross .	1019
1	we had a really great experience at this location this week . their prices beat out the competition , the service was good , and they were very nice . i also was able to get the alignment taken care of at the same time as getting new tires which the competition ca n't do . i will come back again . we have 3 drivers in our house and all 3 of us go to this location and we are pretty happy .	3405
1	i have been impressed with them . always return my call and staff seemed knowledgable of building and surroundings . even updated the apartment recently .	3168
1	dr jennifer is amazing ! her staff is professional and courteous ! i am impressed how well everyone did with my 3 wee ones ! i highly recommend anyone to get their glasses here !	403
1	genet was fabulous . she was very affordable , very professional , makes her clients feel comfortable . she paid a lot of attention to cleanliness , hygiene , and to detail . great job genet , will be back for `` maintenance '' .	1875
0	this review is for some of the dessert items only . i had the salted caramel tart and it 's just plain sweet without the slight bitterness from caramel . no salted taste as well ... bland taste .	3271
0	have n't been to boston pizza for a while , but this place was super slow .. ! ! pizza took an hour . salad was awful . food was garbage ! hope you read this before you go there .	363
0	excellent staff , but i do n't get the raving reviews on food . for example , tropic thunder waffle ... menu says its waffle with fresh mango , peach , pineapple on top , but it was actually fruit cocktail in syrup . fresh out of a can maybe .	580
1	my favorite place for breakfast . they are consistently good and super friendly . they know my order and the prices are reasonable	580
1	i love the ribs here they make it perfect not over or undercooked . and the sauce is delicious . party in my mouth ! also i have tried the pizzas and they are super good ! i tried it place a few times to be sure then i decided to write the review . great place great food !	459
1	the girl at the car wash with the super long hair is always incredibly friendly ! ! she always puts a smile on my face when i pull up . she 's adorable ! ! if you 're having a bad day , go get a car wash and get greeted by the friendliest girl ever ! this place is professional and does a great job ! only place i go to get my car washed and serviced !	2198
0	although we have eaten at -- and really enjoyed -- the roy 's on oahu , our dinner at the roy 's in las vegas was very disappointing . one fish entree was raw , the other was way overcooked and served lukewarm . even the crabcake appetizer , one of our favorites at roy 's , was off at the las vegas location . service was average and hurried , likely because we did n't order any alcohol . i would never return to this location again -- it 's way , way below the standard set by the rest of the franchise .	1534
1	genet is very kind , friendly and welcoming . her private room inside the rain salon is super clean . she was very fast with my brazilian wax and made me feel so comfortable . i will definitely be returning here !	1875
1	my only go-to hookah shop in nw las vegas ! always look out for me and give me a good deal . i took in my expensive triton hookah stem a couple weekends ago , and they helped match up a good mya base and perfect-fitting grommets . hooked me up with some awesome km shisha too !	2568
0	i got a brazilian done here and damn was it a mess . first of all hair on the table ? ? nasty . i 'm not that picky but damn can you at least wax all the hair off . come on . cheap but not worth it	1508
0	bland . my `` hot '' bean curd was anything but -- had to cover it in sriracha . my husband 's hot and sour soup was nothing like any hot and sour he 'd ever had ( and not in a good way ) . the mushrooms looked canned and the chicken in the hot & sour soup was oddly rubbery . this place over americanizes their food and it makes me miss east coast chinese . we 're keeping our hopes up that we 'll find `` our '' chinese take out place in phoenix , but the outlook is n't good if dragon palace is worthy of 4 stars ! one up side : ridiculous amount of food for a really good price .	1264
0	rude customer services . high rental rates and ridiculous cancelation fees . would n't rent from this place ever again .	2949
0	used to be an affordable place for a family meal but prices have gone up an incredible amount . will not be returning until this is reversed .	252
0	rude , very unprofessional , charges wrong price for the pumpkins . supposedly the owner of this patch , tells you , you do n't have to buy them and cowardly walks away and refuses to give the refund . either she is eager to just take your money or does n't know how to run a business and care for her customers .	1900
1	best . bakery . ever . i have to drive over 40 minutes to get here , but it 's 100 % worth it . i hired baker wee to bake my wedding cake last year ( it turned out beautiful and delicious ) , and i just received my free anniversary cake from them this year . even though the cake was free , they did n't skimp - they asked me what flavors i wanted , how we wanted it decorated , etc ... .and the cake was a decent size ( enough to feed a small family ) ! everything they make is so delicious , moist , flavorful , and fresh . i highly recommend baker wee for all your dessert needs !	868
1	lots of choices ! ! and they all sound yummy ! ! i ordered the red rooster and lemon pepper which was a good choice . the young guy up front was even nice enough to let me try some of the other flavors . one of them caught my attention . the cajun butter taste just like boiling crabs sauce . i just love all the unique flavors and the dipping sauces were great ! ! it was finger licking good ! ! if you 're up north stop by and try it yourself . you wo n't regret it ! !	1397
1	i see mixed reviews about this business but for me personally i have to give them 5 stars they made my birthday something to remember , my limo driver was amazing he came a little early but that 's fine , the limo was extremely clean , we could n't get the music to work due to someone breaking the aux cord so he played music of his own and we had a party in the limo lol , his driving was good we got to our destination and back safely and on time i would use this limo service again and i would love to have the same driver each time sheldon you made me and my friends night keep up the good work !	2578
1	i love best buy . staff is knowledgable and friendly the only bad thing is you leave with your little heart broken.. so many gadgets and goodies .	494
0	went here with some friends they love this place when i was at charlie 's had couple of performances and then trivia..had a large beer for cheap i assume my friend paid..i 'm from hawaii i love drag queens there shows are amazing ! ! but here not really : ( and trivia and alcohol not my cup of tea i prefer karaoke and dancing	3661
0	time and time again , tracking shows as delivered , package nowhere to be found . paid extra for saturday delivery - ca n't be located until monday at the earliest , if ever . avoid like a plague !	556
0	the absolute worst hair cut i have ever had in my life . i had to decide between shaving my head or wearing a hat for 2 weeks or more . the worst part is 2/3 of the cut was done by the instructor . you have been warned .	354
0	great for kids between 5-7 yoa . but any older and the eyes will roll and they will think the rides are babyish . it 's nice that parents do n't have to pay if they are n't going on the rides . make sure to check online for coupons before you go . lazer tag is very popular and seemed adequate for the 7 or 8 kids per game . the video arcade games mostly take 2 tokens , about .50 a game .	3791
0	plan on waiting a long time . only person in waiting room , then watched person after person show up and called back . after 45min last appointment time was told it will be another 30min ! last time coming to a simonmed , marquis was much faster .	188
1	since i had to resort to washing my own car ( thank you to another car wash establishment that shall not be named but is named else where ) i started going to the super star car wash . i was able to sign up for a fast pass for $ 6.95 for the first month . normally $ 16.95 . they will also do an auto deduct on your account monthly . fast , easy and convenient . free vacuum 's and air sprayers to clean your car . i have not had to wait yet for a spot . staff seems nice considering interaction is minimal . overall a really good value considering you have to wash your own car .	2939
1	best beer happy hour period . a real pint - 20oz - for $ 5 . great patio and people watching . how can you go wrong .	630
1	i love kohls ! i heard they had juicers on sale ! ohhh yea ! i love the fact that you can go in almost any kohl ; s and there lay outs are about the same !	3896
1	i was at this new lowe 's location yesterday to grab some plumbing item . the place looked very organized . i was approached by a staff asking if i needed help . that does n't happen very often when i go to a home depot or rona - usually you ca n't find them when you need them . also i usually find lowe 's prices are more competitive , a little cheaper than the other home hardware stores and more variety of brands offered . so i 'm glad they finally have a lowe 's nearby in mississauga because i usually have to drive all the way to the etobicoke location to get stuff .	3279
1	had a taro milk tea with boba here . very tasty , well priced , and boba texture was just right . no grainy , hard or soggy boba pieces at all !	490
0	nothing special . small portions and overpriced . fyi - i smelt like i just came out of a deep fryer when i left the place , horrible ventilation . i would n't recommend going out of your way for this .	1417
1	had to wait a bit , but then we got connected with brett kodak who did a fantastic job of getting our pre-approval for our car loan .	3371
0	had a windshield replaced and the tech left glue on the paint and reinstalled the drivers side wiper incorrectly on our vw . sure stuff happens , but we got zero response when contacting safelite to address these issues . we tried several times over several weeks and not even a peep . we have had glass replaced by this company before with no issues so really felt let down . now i need another windshield replaced on a different vehicle . guess who i will not contact ?	1988
0	utter garbage . sold me a bunch of damaged items . worst of all , sold my personal info to a third party firm . still fighting spam , scams and international identity fraud 16 months later because of this place .	3222
0	apartments themselves are nice , it 's the maintenance and management that ruins everything . clearly , they are not paid enough because it shows in the service . i woke up one early morning to extremely extremely loud obnoxious stomps , vibrations , and noise of people working on the roof -- to the point where i woke up thinking something serious was happening . i only get one day to sleep in and it 's always ruined by the leaf blower , this time it was the roof . you will never get a notice when they work on something big so expect to be startled at random times . the gates are always broken .	1828
1	the best place to get a ticket called the last minute and they got me vip place . will definitely come back !	1995
1	if i ever need to find a rental again , i will be contacting apartment hunters . they did an excellent job handling work that needed to be completed in the last rental i lived in . unfortunately a lot of people do n't write reviews when things go right and are so quick to post negative reviews when things go wrong , which seems to be the case here .	3451
0	this pizza was not good . i was really disappointed since there was some good reviews . it had such a weird taste . my boyfriend who loves pizza did n't like it either . such a bummer .	459
1	my experiences has been decent . i knew i am not going to check in a rehab facility with 5 star services . location is hard to find in the dark . the bed is on soft side . everything is very clean . restroom is little far from the bedroom but i am not suppose to use it all night . tv is small . that is my major complaint . staffs are very nice and helpful . i dont know where the negative reviews come from or how old they were . it is getting much better . i dont want to go back there again wish everybody the best .	610
0	i wish they had 0 stars ! ! ! well , been trying to get a hold of the their weight loss physician for over almost a week and a half now . every time i call , she 's with a client so i leave a vm and i never get a call back . the receptionists takes my phone number down and still nothing . the last time i talked to her , she said she should have an answer the next day and it 's a week and a half already with no phone calls back . this is beyond effing ridiculous . you 're office is a major joke !	297
1	i m a new fan of belk ! great bargain ! blazers , sweaters and shoes . my new favorite store . if u have the time the clearance items are great bargains .	2910
1	very friendly staff and great spg recognition . room was clean and ready upon arrival .	3522
0	we went here for an escape from the heat- but unfortunately they barely had any a/c on and we only realized this after we had purchased the tickets . i 'd go to any other theatre if your goal is to have a nice cool break from the az summer heat .	1240
0	this place is seriously a joke show . i do n't even know where to begin . just do yourself a favor and do n't use them . if you decide to , be aware and do n't say i did n't warn you . had issues i wanted to address with management and they could n't find anyone for me when i called . i 've called human resources 5x with no answer each time and no call back . horrible service to say the least !	3132
1	i love this market everything is cheap , i can get all my homeland cooking stuff , the have fresh fish , marinated meats , korean food court which has awesome selection food and open late !	715
0	i had n't gone to bonterra outside of restaurant week once in two years . everything was overpriced , food was cold and inedible . the mussels were not fresh . all seafood dishes had aioli which was unnecessary and lacked any type of real seasoning . lackluster birthday dinner with the family to say the least as everyone was unpleased with their meal . this place left much to be desired .	886
0	there was a remodel for the cafe area and it looks the same . wow . they upgraded the pizza oven and took off a shelf . yet they became even less efficient . they still have 2 registers but only use 1 . costco has at least 3 registers going at all times . today 's wait for service was longer than normal , hence the review . step your game up .	2172
0	i ca n't even begin to tell you how overpriced the wine is here . last night we had a bottle chappellet wine with our meal at an upscale scottsdale restaurant . we paid 65 for it . tonight we ate in downtown chandler and they wanted 130 for the same exact bottle . my husband and i have had many red wines while visiting places from baltimore to california . never have i seen a more overpriced bottle of wine . this place needs to get over itself ! where do you think you are new york ?	49
0	great drinks and dancing but terrible staff . bartender actually refused serving me a water because `` they did n't have any . '' she also waited on three people before me , knowing i was there first . very rude . bouncer also would n't allow re- entry to bar therefore creating a huge mess with group of friends . ruined the night . very disappointing..	2313
0	terrible experience with doctors and pa and their bedside manner . do not suggest going there . go to a professional .	3566
1	this review is for ashley , my therapist , and the entire team who were at the desk when i checked out today . you will never know what you did for me today . you renewed my faith in humanity . you showed me a love and kindness i have never felt and it brought me to tears . your gesture will help me heal . i do n't have enough words to thank you . you must be angels . you definitely were to me .	1950
0	the services especially for women 's haircut is terrible and a total rip-off . not happy with the result of my haircut . the price is way too high considering it 's not a high end hair salon . watch out for the services like blow dry because they charged same price as the haircut . actually , more than the price that i paid at donato salon in square one . i will never go back to this place again .	3083
1	i had a root canal done at another dentist office less than a year ago and had continuing problems with them so i called and spike with vickie the office manager she was very nice and empathetic and got me in the same day with dr. wandershafer they did a full exam and i had to have the tooth pulled.the staff was amazing very friendly and understanding my fears . the dr. was very gentle and has a very calming presence . i have finally found a dentist i like and trust . i would highly recommend this office to everyone.. 5 star treatment	3766
1	pretty good coffee selection ... stumbled upon this place on my way to the office .	2059
0	way way overpriced , staff did n't know if they were coming or going . i had bought a solar panel off amazon and noticed they had the same one only $ 450 more for exact same fold up panel .	3890
1	omg ! delicious and authentic . satisfied my craving for authentic ramen soup ! now , i know where i 'm going to eat ! and they have a sake meter of sweet to dry . the yokohama style ramen is superb with the seasoned egg ... ..and know you can get the egg soft boiled to perfection . they have tapas , donburi , ramen , and sake . i highly recommend this restaurant . no sushi here .	131
0	this store is fine , however , if you ever want to return something , dont , you might as well try and sell whatever it is to get your money back . i have called 3 times now , sitting on hold for at least 15 minutes ( no joke ) waiting to speak with just someone about why my return label was not sent to me . i 'm at a dead end and will not be purchasing anything else from online or in store .	2910
0	great selection but one cashier ... there was about 7 employees in the building and 6 of us waiting to check out .	3943
1	good place for a quick coffee . solid drink done to order and fast friendly service . they have a small selection of grab and go snacks .	2397
0	had the buffet here..food was fine..the server was good..i only wished there were more servers here..bcoz there were too many customers for jst 2 servers..it can help the service be faster..giving it 2 stars only for this reason..had to wait for too long to get my cheque.. ambience was nice..	600
1	good place with good doctors . the staff in general is okay however they always seem so busy because the place is usually jam packed . walk ins can be tricky you better be on time and ready since they only accept a limited number . appoints can be slow and often 2 or 3 weeks ahead of what you were expecting . best to have your doctor fill in a bunch of future dates for you . friendly folk and great location overall . doctors are awesome and willing to sit and listen to you and offer great advise . thanks desert bloom !	1598
0	my husband dragged me here to try it out . the meal was horrendous at best ... and over priced . spent $ 40 for two people . we definitely wo n't be back . on a positive note it was true to theme .	144
1	amazing prices and great work dry cleaning and sewing some repairs , plus customer service from jarely is the best ! highly recommend them .	1719
0	probably one of the more frustrating experiences i 've with a restaurant . long story short : i wanted crab puffs , did n't get crap puffs in delivery , called restaurant , they told me to call grubhub , called grubhub , and the grubhub guy could n't find my order and failed ; so no refund ... maybe the staff was off its game , or what not , but all i wanted was crab puffs . so if you try to deliver from this place with your priority being crab puffs - be wary . aaaaand to top it off , there was a hair in my food . teaches me one lesson though , do n't tip before you get your food .	474
0	pretty good but the service is awful . i 'm deathly allergic to oranges so i asked for none in my bowl . when i take a bite it 's like an orange explosion and my throat immediately started to swell up song close . they need to pay more attention because this could have killed me . when i went back , she asked if i was going to buy another one . wtf ! ? she was so rude like she did n't believe me or something . i would appreciate if a manger would get in contact with me because that 's not ok when it comes to people 's lives	209
1	very nice & clean . all workers were nice & helpful . their baby section really is n't that big but they had cute toys for the kids . cold drinks . this walgreens is close to the hampton inn which is good for people staying at the hotel & it 's convenient .	2871
0	donuts are meh . good luck getting your drink order right at this location . america runs from dunkin .	1761
0	as stated in previous reviews by others , be very careful when entering into an agreement with this pm . fees are unearthly . company refused to provide me with my security deposit back and made claims that i owed them a little over 2k after i moved out . i recently had to file against the company in small claims and was awarded what was owed to me . know your rights as a tenant , do n't be afraid to file and dispute these outrageous fees/charges . i would not recommend this company to anyone looking to rent a home .	843
1	i 'm not sure the reason for all of the negative reviews . we have been renting a property through them since 11/2013 with absolutely zero issues . anytime we need a repair or have had an issue they are very quick to respond . they do not have `` in house '' maintenance and i can verify that as the few times we have needed something , a professional company has come out . clara and jim have always been available to us for anything we might need , or any questions we may have . i would highly recommend renting through this company .	3045
0	how hard is it to pick up a phone ? i called to speak with the manager 2 weeks ago about canceling my membership . i was told that she was busy but would return my call . i called again the following day with the same excuse and no call . following my third failed attempt i sent an email and again no response . the massage service has been fair but the management is very poor . do n't allow yourself to be placed in their monthly debit program . shame on you massage heights for treating your clients with so little respect or responsiveness .	2653
0	this show needs major updating . it 's a variety show that features a lot of breasts ( expected ) and men in bananna hammocks ( unexpected ) ... .throw in some random acrobats and that 's the show folks ! not much to see here at all - there are a hundred other great shows in vegas i would see before this . both my husband and i could not wait for this 1.5 hour debacle to end !	3069
0	this place was awful and the service nonexistent . i do n't know why it got good reviews . also the waiter seemed personally offended that we had brought our two young kids with us - even though it was early in the evening - and relegated us to siberia . it seemed like he 'd never seen customers come in with a kid before .	240
0	run from this place it is a black hole for automotive repair . they have had our car for almost 4 months and blames everyone else . this was only the back right quarter panel , easy job . they did n't even start on it for over 36 days . we only went there as a referral form the dealer and they have stopped referring them too . stay away ! ! ! ! ! !	8
1	i have been coming here since i 've moved to henderson which is back in 2001 . it 's always busy when i come here and staff is usually very nice . they 're on top of their game when i come here and food comes to your car quickly . one thing i wish they continued to do was have the workers roll around in roller blades . it would bring out the 50 's theme !	844
0	this store is so nasty and dirty . merchandise on the floor and the floor behind the cashiers looked like they had not swept in months . the manager looked like the store , dirty and not good with his hygiene . 1st and last time i go in there . oh and i was there at 10am . never again . i will tell my friends and family not to shop there .	2154
0	i usually do n't write to many reviews but felt it necessary . i 've been coming to this place on and off for many years . the service is never been that great but i think they 've hit an all time low . food is expensive for the quality you get . my recommendation would be to drive a little further to get better for better pricing with pleasant service .	198
1	my favorite whole foods in town ! i love the bakery department ! lianne , sophia , celina , and flavio are the absolute best people there !	433
1	dr. rollie 's office was very professional . all of the staff members were friendly and helpful . i was educated and given useful information for pre and post surgery . they all made me feel safe and at ease because i 've never had any type of surgery before and i was nervous .	3203
0	i love the reviewer who claims that `` toronto does n't have the knowledge to do his nails justice '' . what is he alien with special nails ? whatever - look , the fact is the guy who runs this place is in my experience , a bit of a jerk who is short with customers and mean to staff . the women who work here do a good job but i ca n't stand watching the abuse the `` manager '' inflicts on them . i have a much more pleasant experience down the street at m nails where the owner treats her customers and her staff with the same high level of respect .	3247
0	worst place i have ever been to ! would not recommend at all . i have never been to a place that charges $ 35 for a pedicure and does n't include a massage ... not very friendly staff either . it is worth driving a couple extra miles to another salon rather than going to this place .	2686
1	my hair was messed up from v 's barbershop came here hoping that they could fix it up and they did an awesome job sam is highly recommended and they can do all types of cuts cheap haircut to 15 bucks and they do it right the first time .	3350
1	great food , great value , super friendly staff and a nice-homey , neighbourhoody vibe . we live in the bluffs , but it 's well worth the drive on sunday morning for a great brekkie .	1310
0	merchandise and employees are exactly what you would expect in an old navy . any enjoyment you may normally get from your shopping trip will be eliminated by the skull crushing volume of the music . music that should offer background noise to your shopping experience is pouring out at such a high volume that you are forced to raise your voice to a yell when talking to someone just on the other side of the table .	2617
0	this has to be one of my worst experiences . decided to stop for a quick bite before meeting a friend and since the place was empty , i expected fast service . boy was i wrong . it took ages for the tuna tataki and buns to come out . texture of the tuna was very dodgy and the taste was more than lifeless . the buns were far from light and fluffy as they should be and the vegetables on them were seriously dehydrated . total embarrassment to asian food .	1582
0	ugh . they promised that the new door hardware key would be compatible with our existing key . it was n't . so now we 're stuck with two separate keys for the house . then the keys were either not included or they were lost , and they had all sorts of attitude about 'trying to help , but i 'm not sure what we can do ' talk . why did n't they keep the key number ? sloppy systems , plenty of arrogance and not recommended .	249
0	nicole has the worst customer service in this branch . she let customers wait in line while she chatted with a friend , and then act like she did n't know people are waiting ! definitely not good .	1996
0	worst experience ever ! ! ! stay far away ! just moved to the area and wanted to enjoy a nice pedicure . employees were rude/unhelpful ... . and asked to charge me for the pedicure before it had even started ! me and a gf went and were extremely disappointed especially when we were paying 50-70 for our pedis ! ! we will never be back and i highly recommend everyone else stay far away !	822
1	i love this airline . i did n't have any of the issues that other people wrote about . we flew out of stockton , and to las vegas . our flight was on time , did n't lose our baggage , and the flight attendants were friendly . me and dh were able to fly round trip to vegas for 200 $ together that was cheaper than driving as we had planned . we found that we did n't need the shuttle because our rental company offered a bus to pick us up , we did n't need special seats and were still able to sit together without the priority seating . i love this airline .	3127
1	i never liked burritos before i tried the mango chicken burrito from burrito bandidos ! the food here is always delicious , the music is good ( and not too loud ) and above all , the service is amazing ! there has never been a time that i have visited this location and have n't been greeted with warm smiles and incredibly friendly service . they really go above and beyond to ensure that everyone has a pleasurable visit . even after moving a fair distance away , i find i 'm still coming back to this location . totally worth it !	31
0	this is one of the trashiest targets in the phoenix metro area , and has been for years . strange , considering the location . it feels like it 's being run by an ex-manager from kmart . the walmart supercenter nearby is cleaner and better maintained .	1178
1	go to rafi , hes trying to do the business with you so he will do the best he can to get you out the door with what you want ! thanks rafi , see you next time !	2756
1	my weekend workout spot . this is a full service gym complete with childcare , group classes , basketball court , outside track , indoor pool ( swim lessons ) and a cool outside water park in the summer . just remember to bring your towel as they eliminated towel service some time ago .	349
0	very bad place many of the things here to play were broken and the rides are garbage half of them were broken you win junk when you want to get a prize for your tickets the service is horrible workers were runnning around like little kids and almost hit my son when they were running like little kids this place looks like they are going to close down this place is such a ghetto beware ppl do not come here if you love your kids	3791
0	this place customers service sucks i could imagine their service . the cashier was not helpful and rude not only to me but with a veteran also asking questions about service .	2392
1	absolutely love dr. garcia she 's great with both my children . very friendly ! i was recently in was able to do a same day sick appointment and yes there was a wait like every doctor 's office i 've been to but i do n't mind waiting for a doctor who 's going to give my kids her full attention . it also helps that the office is very kid friendly love that the kids can keep busy while we wait . very hard to find a good pediatric office who can see you the same day and has a great doctor . definitely recommend her to anyone who needs a caring pediatrician .	2461
1	the arizona diamondbacks may not be an awesome team but in the air conditioned dome it was a fun experience . we had seats in the all you can eat and drink section . only hotdogs , peanuts and popcorn plus soft drinks . hey , what do you expect from an all you an eat section ! it was a new experience for both of us , we had never seen so many hotdogs eaten ! we each had one , they were pretty tasty and a really fun day ! !	2005
0	i was offered one service but when tech arrived was told it was not possible so more expensive service was installed . service worked for 24 hours and went out . another teck came out to fix it . they tried to charge me for their mistake . i am paying double . this was not offered . my phone and tablets often lose internet i 'm looking for another proveder .	664
1	the managers are very helpful , and out of all of the pet stores in the area , this one carries the best breeds and temperament puppies . we have 4 petland dogs , no problems with any of them genetically . the workers still remember our dogs ' names and ask about them . when we bought our last puppy , but we 're going out of town the next week , one of them even offered to dog sit for us !	466
0	if there was an option for zero stars that 's my choice . they did not abide by the signed agreement between buyer and seller . when they released money without agreement and did shoddy work they were discovered . at that point they hid behind their attorneys who simply used only partial facts about the situation . by then the home was resold and i was in another state . a lawsuit would have been expensive and they were counting on that . i felt that their bond should be revoked for not being honest and protect both parties to the sale .	3783
1	my husband and i were visiting ohio , from michigan . we liked the mall it has a lot of the major stores that we love here at home . we did a lot of shopping , and all the sales people we encountered were courteous and personable , something you do n't get much here in michigan . no snooty attitudes just nice atmosphere . we will be back to shop more when back in ohio . : )	492
1	i started coming here last fall after a friend referred me and i have never had a bad experience ! the owner tammy is so sweet and everyone here does a great job ! i regularly get gel manicures and spa pedis !	3333
1	we have used firebird housing as our management company for over fifteen years . they have always been professional and managed our two properties in gilbert with the outmost of care . i would highly recommend them to homeowners . lynda h	3512
0	good range of coffees and methods , but i was very disappointed with the end result . my v60 kenya was tepid and underextracted . i do n't mean not scalding -- i mean no heat whatever . wo n't return .	1175
0	after two days of getting my nails done , my white gel color was faded and changing in color . if i could give less that a star i would . their customer service when it came to fixing the problem was less than professional , ending in a yelling match in the salon . this was my second and last time coming to this salon ; when the first time i came with a scheduled apt , i did n't get my services till an hour later .	3462
1	great fresh bread , amazing food options , friendly staff . great place to purchase am amazing rice cooker and quality rice .	2664
0	dirty . tub runs during shower . tub drains very slowly so you stand in about 3 inches of water while you shower . my phone did n't work at all . people were leaving me messages and i did n't know . i switched rooms after that . second room was a bit better and i had a view . first room was on the roof top of the casino . no view . the carpet in the hallways is awful . there is damage everywhere on the walls in the elevator etc . i wold not stay there again . the only thing nice about this place is the staff .	2976
0	thursday night @ 6 pm . terribly slow service . we were just forgotten . with a small hungry child i had to go chasing down a piece of bread . the food was so , so and only served after an interminable long wait . in all , a most unsatisfactory evening . we will never go again . ( we have been here before , not better then . ) all you shoppers - go elsewhere .	534
1	kee kee b . is always so friendly and helpful , i always do self checkout and she is always making sure i get the best deals and never has any problems helping me.. thanks kee kee !	2316
1	this was one of the worse banking experiences i have ever had . from my experience with him isaac he could use more customer service training .	3710
1	this play was really cool . a welcome change from the trampoline parks . we were lucky that there were not a lot of people . the only issue we had was the conversations between the staff members on the harness area for the aerial ropes . a bit inappropriate for kids to hear about drinking and partying and who is going where . focus should be on the customer first and foremost . manager should have a meeting to reinforce that . otherwise . awesome .	3677
1	customer service very nice , was waited on promptly , and the food has flavor to it , unlike many others panda express i purchased food at . i will definitely come back here whenever i want some panda express .	958
0	stay away ! we hired saiaf for our wedding . the week before i called to go over the details and they said it was already taken care of . -on the day of we did n't get pictures with family members that we wanted to . -the team took a smoke break before the reception started -we did not get our pictures on time . it was an argument just to even get them back a few months after they were promised to us . -the editing was not what we had discussed . they seem to be very disorganized and money driven . i would not recommend this company to anyone for their wedding .	1852
0	.we always went for the fish & chips . went a couple weeks ago and they changed it out from hand battered to frozen . very dissapointed . now we need to find a new place	3580
0	the staff is rude . katherine would not activate my guest pass that i filled out online & did not give me a valid reason . this gym is very dirty and needs new equipment . everything is always broken down & staff is always unavailable .	1802
1	took the the team for a celebration dinner based off of the yelp reviews and location . what 's amazing place . food and service was great ! ! ! would definitely go back and recommend going .	621
0	sahlers brand from buffalo , new york ( get a rope ! ) ai n't the same as chicago beef kosher dogs . these `` red '' hots are n't even red ! white hots more like it . as bland as the state of ny is statist !	58
0	used to be good 10 years ago until recently ( 2013-present ) frequent visits all left us with the same souvenir , tummy-aches after we got home . lots of chinese celebrations here for mid-summer autumn and the new year . is always booked for parties . large selection of food and drinks . decorated western-styled . parking is a breeze .	338
1	really really good asian food . big portions , 2 could dine for less than $ 15 . beef pad thai so full of flavour , in fact all the food is rich with flavour . best chinese food in chandler , arizona . imho	474
1	great outdoor seating and tables but inside seating is limited and crowded . dog-friendly and walker/biker friendly . trendy for a trendy neighborhood .	44
1	so far i got really good cuts for ivan , friendly people . kinda busy all the time but i usuall grt appointments on the same day	3469
1	i love this place . i love their pub food . i always order their moulin rouge flammekueche and my bf loves their pulled pork sandwich . i have tried other things here but those are the mains i always go back to . we always like their fries/poutine and their creme brulee . do n't come here expecting a quiet night out , it 's really busy and can get quite loud ... what did you expect ? it 's a bar atmosphere . overall , one of my go to places .	670
1	hands down , best car wash in town . my first time here & adam did a fantastic job . all of my sons accidental spills of juice was gone . it was almost like he detailed my car . this is a good 20 minutes away from my house but i would n't go anywhere else . thank you , adam !	2359
0	honestly this place has the biggest reputation for being a cheap ratchet club and it 's very true . i think people like it here because booths are cheap in comparison to downtown toronto clubs . even though i enjoyed the music , it was too much of an aggressive crowd for me . appearance wise , it was surprisingly modern looking and pretty clean for a club . i love how the vip area is blocked off and also has its own dance floor area . not my first choice club .	3724
0	funny how if you scroll to the bottom of this site and go to filtered reviews that all the bad ones are flagged so you ca n't read them . the food sucks , and is cold . staff is the laziest bunch of chinese people i have ever seen . management is rude and does n't care . beware of getting sick after eating we did . tried one more time and sick again along with they raised the prices and taken them off the website so they can rob you without you knowing	165
1	pretty good for all you can eat . the menu is quite large and you order using a notepad . the kitchen missed the rolls we had listed at the bottom so we prompted our waitress . service was ok and most of the food came out quickly . some coordination in the kitchen to put everything on the same plate would be nice so we do n't end up with 10 little plates at once .	206
0	beware , amy is a terrible technician . she is stubborn , hateful , rude and does poor quality work . she seems angry and bitter . no tip for her and wont go back to the salon . i work in marketing so i am spreading the word about this horrible place . i saw them reuse pedicure implements on others without sanitization . im reporting them to the board of cosmetology in harrisburgh	100
1	ca n't beat their excellent service and fantastic prepared foods . love that they support many local vendors like mitchell 's , erie island coffee and many more	1653
0	extremely shady company . poor business ethics . nothing but excuses and now they avoid calls when customers call for assistance . car are a joke and the managers arent any better . run far far away . youd have better luck with drivetime ... ..	3305
1	wonderful & comfortable dentist experience ! i would highly recommend them to everyone as the service is phenomenal .	3139
1	i was pretty scared when i read the reviews of this company . i never thought i 'd get my ipad from apple , that it would mostly like get lost or delivered at the wrong place . well ontrac pulled through and my package was delivered promptly and in great condition . the only reason i 'm giving a 4 out of 5 is because i feel as though an item like my ipad or anything of value should not just be left at the front door . but other than that i 'm very pleased !	556
0	the worst staff ever ! they never pick up their phone ... .when you leave a voicemail they never respond ... ... the dr. told me to make an appointment for a procedure in a few months i called to do that the staff which took a week to get on the phone ( the staff not the doctor ) told me i need to schedule another appointment before the procedure because they didnt have the correct infor in their notes ... .nice try ! very unresponsive staff..terrible ! the doctor was very nice .	1357
1	so excited for amazing people forgive me our server wallie ... ups do n't remember and hes amazing 100 % ... .my friend michelle and i want 2 catch up ... .food 100 ... .team 100 manager 100 ... drinks so great that i drop mine ... .wow 100 all accross ... ..kyrenia ... .many more visits to come yay	1332
1	the food was very delicious and it was a nice and calm place with great hookahs	19
1	this place is amazing . i have tried multiple in the area and no one comes close . hannah is the best , she ordered the entire line of kiara sky dip powder because it 's the best and the only kind that works well with my nails . the staff is friendly , accommodating and the salon is gorgeous ! i highly recommend ! !	1834
0	terrible customer service . called the store and spoke to nick about having a new magazine tube installed on my benelli m4 . he told me that it could be done today . i arrived 5 minutes after hanging the phone up and spoke with another employee.he told me that nick was busy with two other guns and he would not be able to get to mine for two days . do n't trust what you hear on the phone i guess ? will not be returning for any reason and i will urge those i work with to do the same . thank you spartan arms for helping me whittle down my gun store choices .	2247
0	went in here and was quickly turned off by the bitch at the front counter . some old hag who was completely utterly rude . seriously , who talks to people like this ? ? ? ? promptly walked out . will never set foot in there again . owner take note .	2612
1	sam is always on time and fair about pricing . i understand that with three dogs and one 3 year old boy , my carpets are in need of something other than just my dyson ! sam has been my go to carpet and tile cleaner for nearly 2 years now !	2808
0	it was an expensive mistake . the operator either could n't understand or refused to understand that my nails were different lengths and that she had smudged one of them . it was a frustrating experience !	3603
0	they broke into my apartment , my neighbors another one behind and another one in the back , another apartment got caught in fire ... i 'm thinking it must be someone that works there because they were in and out , i had gone to the pool for like 20 minutes , it 's sad low life people destroy good things , we had to break our lease and moved out . please lock your balconies get a ring for doorbell and there 's window alarms , safety first when you have kids . we lived in-front of the bus station . not safe at all .	2033
1	ducky 's is fun if you 're up for a night of drunken dive bar karaoke . if that is n't your thing , then you may want to give it a miss .	3164
1	if you 're looking for great authentic peruvian food ... do n't look any further . this restaurant has delicious written all over it ! the lomo saltado is awesome and i ca n't wait to go back and try more !	927
1	this place is great ! we go here often and always have good service and food . lunch specials are a great deal . we always take home left overs . the portions are large , so you get to enjoy jade for 2 meals ! ! !	489
0	so frustrating . i keep trying because i absolutely love my bike but maybe one more chance .	94
1	fantastic food great service . the owner assures all of us satisfied and having a good time . no needs unmet . tasty food great prices . staff was top notch . virginia and brenda are fantastic	717
1	very delicious place . the prix fixe menu is a good deal ! i tried their pork chop dish and between that and the appetizer , this was way too much food for me ( perfect for the boys though ) . we were here for a birthday dinner and they give a free small cake to the birthday person as well . it was a nice touch . service was excellent .	1534
1	just moved to charlotte from boston and looking for a good taxi service ( travel a lot for work ) . i found this service on yelp and decided to try them . the service is very professional and arrived at the exact time i requested the car . it was also a very clean vehicle that was smoke-free . i highly recommend this service compared to regular taxis that do n't show up on time , or are dirty inside . plus , this company takes cash or credit card , ideal for business travelers like myself .	1814
0	the general manager responded to my yelp review and asked that i contact him directly to discuss this and find a resolution . well , i guess that is just a comment to make it appear to yelp users that he cares . i emailed and called a week ago and he has not returned my email or call . you 've been warned ...	624
0	this is an okay location as for organization and the store was pretty clean . however the cashier 's are only when you are making purchases . when making a return with tags still attached and receipt in hand they make you wait and wait in line . then they are rude . i purchased a girls pair of mk shoes . my daughter wore them twice and they literally started coming apart while she was wearing them at school . talk about embarrassing for my 10year old . so much for buying brand name .	482
1	this is my go-to store . what ever i need for work or home . they have it here . the prices are not cheap nor are they very expensive either . remember , you also get what you pay for . i 'll pay more for quality and excellent workmanship . i do n't mind buying awesome products i can trust . this place is definitely above the rest . they always have a great assortment to pick from . not the cheap knock-offs made in china you find at walmart .	3086
1	shannon of samsung inside the store is very knowledgeable and friendly . we had a good education and great conversations aside of the product . hubby and i thoroughly enjoyed the visit to best buy .	494
1	always have a great experience here , amazing customer service and the ladies are so nice ! ! !	162
1	this is my usual morning coffee stop , and it 's generally good . the few time 's they 've mixed something up , they have always taken care of the problem with no fuss . ( and it 's been very few times ) i much prefer this location to the mayfield heights one . food and service is remarkably better .	3226
1	wow ! really good food ! i had the half chicken with beans and rice . very flavorful and cooked perfect ! not dry at all . loved the beans and the grilled jalapeño that came with the meal . definitely will be a routine lunch spot for me !	1581
1	the food here is always good . nice atmosphere too ! it 's still a sandwich place , but just different enough to be refreshing .	484
0	i was extremely disappointed in the van gogh-alive exhibit . the large screens projected muddy looking , pixilated , blurry images . i was expecting vivid , sharp images . van gogh was all about intense hues and bold brush strokes . this was totally lost . the colors were muted and inaccurate compared to the originals , and there was n't enough detail to enjoy the rich texture of the brush strokes . at $ 25 a head , there should have been an original painting or two for people to see . this exhibit was not worth the $ 25 in my opinion . save your money for a museum that can exhibit his originals .	3891
1	i 'm not even into country music but this place was so fun . you do n't feel out of place and the drinks are more than reasonably priced . dj plays in between so you get a variety .	2860
0	i 'll tell ya , today at/in the rock yard was extremely frustrating . i 've probably loaded my pickup 50 tomes w rock there n today was a mess . very busy , but very poorly organized as well . the girls in the shack we 're too busy to b able to pay attention to the scale n the new guy loading was slow n inefficient . i realize things happen but frustrating nonetheless	99
1	came in for an event in the dominion ballroom this weekend . the hotel lobby and conference rooms are beautiful and clean . especially enjoyed the holiday decor and the outdoor waterfall . great location and helpful concierge desk . also connects to the path and it was raining outside so it was nice not having to get wet . parking at city hall is also attached via the path and only $ 8 for all day parking on saturday !	1690
0	this lab is getting worse by the visit , shame on sonora for not recognizing wait times , and ridiculous appointment offer . 1.5 hour with for 5 min procedure , i was told , well you could make an a appointment . but it 's 3 weeks out ! this is ridiculous , and it 's needs to be addressed . 3 stars is not an accurate rating for this lab .	3325
0	when i went to go see zootopia last week ( great movie btw ) , i prepared myself to take the ultimate test of pop culture and moving pictures : timeplay . to my dismay , this cineplex completely skipped timeplay and went straight to the upcoming movie previews . is it too much to ask for the administration of a simple timeplay test in this day and age ? how am i supposed to collect those measely 50 scene points and bragging rights if cineplex fails to administer timeplay ?	884
0	said he would come by to give me a quote per our phone conversation and have n't heard back from him after a follow up text . maybe it 's because we only had one tree to trim and he wants big jobs only ? ? ? ? after my post we received a call from the owner to come by which he did the next day . price was not competitive however for one tree and we were able to have our one tree trimmed for 1/2 the price he quoted the next day .	334
0	i feel ripped off . i blindly ordered a carne asada burrito and i paid close to $ 10 no drink . i sat down feeling like i over paid trying to figure out why it was so much for a regular taco joint burrito . since this place is on rainbow maybe it 's unicorn meat i thought but nope . the burrito is good however not $ 10 good . i will never go to this place again just because it 's over priced .	857
0	i went to the sonic on craig many times and every time i 've appeared my server named kevin has been very disrespectful . i asked for ketchup and ranch and he gave it to me very rude and rolled his eyes as i asked . no manners for others and very disrespectful . this has happen several times now and i will not be appearing there anymore .	994
1	normally i go to the rei in boca park by my house , but my school is by the district so i thought i 'd take a look today ; i am so glad i did . the customer service was wonderful and i was n't bombarded to sign up for a membership like i am at the one in boca park . i wish i remembered the cashiers name because she was so helpful , pleasant and sweet .	1059
0	1 star review this place is a joke for sure . its dirty and they do n't take care of anything . the grounds are unkept and all the apartments have multiple things wrong . i lived here for 4 years and after paying my rent on time even early this place still treated me like crap . i hate this apartments do n't waste your time go somewhere else . this place is horrible and not safe ! ! ! !	2379
1	we ordered an arrangement today that was not pictures on there website . they asked what we wanted and they created it better than we asked for . the delivery person even sang happy birthday . i would recommend .	3622
1	i always have fun here . robert is a great bartender ! all the bartenders are friendly that i 've encountered . great live music and loaded machines . i 'd recommend stopping by and hanging out for a while . if nothing else good people watching and good conversation with the bartenders .	2634
1	i absolutely love this place . the drunken noodles are amazing . i 've gone for the past 3 thursdays in a row . it 's my new meal on thursdays ! lol ... i 've only had one issue . one of the girls who took my order was rude and i did n't like her at all . but since the food is so good i will still give it a 5 . plus the owner is so sweet and nice .	1203
1	this is my favourite movie theatre to go to . because it is in a new plaza , there 's a new shop opening almost every couple of months . so it 's always entertaining to come here and check out what 's new . i like the artworks displayed around in the building . the vip lounge is very comfortable and roomy . even the washroom is very upgraded to individual stalls with toilet and sinks . the staffs are very nice and the place is very clean .	884
0	i purchased a couch in may from the store . the services people were very nice but told me delivery would only be 2-4 weeks ( which is the only reason i purchased this couch ) and on the 4th week i called to see what the status was for them to tell me they had zero update ! very frustrating ! i called back again and the lady told me it would be maybe july . with no willing to compensate me with at least free delivery , i canceled my order . very disappointing . i will not be shopping here again .	2071
0	still upset that current ad is never anywhere on line ... losing customers over this .	473
0	so . i went here 3x to give them a chance . 1st time i ordered a pizza i brought it home and it was wrong i asked for pepperoni and mushroom they did half mushrooms half pepperoni and cold . 2nd time it was so greasy , the cheese was separating , i could n't eat it . 3rd time i tried pasta , there was no flavor and was watery , i had to put ragu on it . and they give you a mini loaf of bread with nothing on it . three strikes you are out . ‍	773
1	i would highly recommend this place when needing to see a dermatologist ; the staff is pleasant and jimmy tran is knowledgeable with a good personable manner . just recently had some minor surgery done and jimmy made this procedure quick and painless !	3598
1	this is my favorite coffee shop in oakland , mostly for the friendly leftist atmosphere . the drinks are solidly ok , nothing special . i usually get iced tea .	596
0	ate here due to great reviews . so so so disappointed ! shrimp taco was gross and was made with uncooked tiny salad shrimp with cabbage thrown on top . chips & corn tortilla uses for a shredded beef taco were stale . cheese enchilada and southwest burrito were okay .	548
0	this has always been my favorite restaurant but they have changed the chicken recipe on the balsamic chicken salad . the chicken used to be the best , now it 's less than basic . unfortunately i will need to find a new favorite salad or new restaurant .	1116
0	food was consistent with other ihops . slow service , unfriendly staff . will not come back to this location .	520
1	*this review was n't based off my experience but from the costumer before hand* it 's 2am and the couple in front of me had no idea what they wanted and the barista , rocio , was very accommodating and patient with them . from what i heard they sounded non-american , so i kinda expected for her to be rude or be irritable . rocio was the complete opposite ! i 'm a stickler for costumer service and she 's a1 . my drink costed $ 6.49 ( a venti ) , where in hi i could get less even when they 're still pricey , but happily tipped because again , a1 costumer service .	683
1	not much to say , i absolutely love this fry 's . the associates are always kind and professional . they always remind you to use your fry 's card . produce is always fresh . prices compared to albertson 's are obvious savings .	914
0	for the second day in a row i have gone into two different starbucks the first being the one in the new summerlin downtown macys and their not be any coffee ready . really ? you do n't have any coffee ready ? the macys starbucks had about 5 people behind the counter so they had no excuse .	44
1	from right when i walked through the door , i 've never been treated so kindly at a nail salon . the nail techs took their time on my nails and toes and were very thorough . i will definitely tell my family and friends about this location and will be coming back soon again .	1288
1	awesome food , excellent service-antonio is the best services . place is clean , bathroom clean n cool instrumental music plays to soothe the soul ! food is authentic and classic peruian ! great food !	927
0	our visit was during their first several months of operation - and , in all fairness , was still getting their footing with kitchen and staff ! sorry - a chain restaurant - and very very average to lousy food . the salsa was weird tasting , the meats tough , the rice and all of the extras were simply bad . also - for carry-out , just do n't bother . they will not get your order correct - ever ! there are better mexican restaurants in town that are not a `` chain '' that have excellent kitchens and experienced chefs ! !	1094
0	the grocery store itself is okay . good selection , and the pc-branded housewares are fairly cheap . plenty of parking and there is a beer store on location . really the negative review here is for the on-location pc financial `` pavillion '' or booth whatever they want to call it . the one guy manning the booth in the evenings is straight up terrible . we came in to open a new savings account to weeks ago . just as we were getting things started , he leaves us and starts helping other customers ! needless to say we left immediately without finishing the process .	1665
0	there is nothing special about this place except for convenience if you are staying at the fairmont . the drinks are standard , food is about the same , if not below . positives- interesting cocktail list , and decent service if you do n't sit at the bar ( the blond waitress is lovely and great ) . the negatives- all of the food is overpriced and not so hot . my friends and i used to put down a lot of money here until we realized we realized we were better off at a places in market square like revel and roost and poros .	1261
0	my friends and i went in for brunch this morning ( on a sunday ) the service was horrible . our server served us one round of drinks . came back to the table a half hour later to take our food order . our food took over an hour to come out , meanwhile our server never came to the table to offer refills or more drinks . we expected to have a couple drinks and a nice brunch , but it was the opposite . my friends and i all work in the service industry so we are always understanding in these situations but this was outrageous . we will never be back .	1253
1	i come here once every couple of months and i 've never had an issue with the front desk staff . they are always friendly and get you checked in and out quickly . the facility is pretty big and easy to find . there is also plenty of parking . dr. cohen always takes his time and is very friendly . he is the best and i 'm glad he is the one i see . there is also a lab onsite ( sonora quest ) and there is almost never a wait !	2845
0	i thought i would really like this show but it was so boring i kept falling asleep . i felt like i was a parent forced to watch the school play cause i had some retarded kid in it . we ended up leaving during the intermission . we had excellent seats-section b row n and got the tickets for free . the costumes were neat and there were some cool set/scenes but i would be upset if i had paid $ 440 ( $ 110 each ) . i would rather watch the movie any day .	3022
0	terrible job . toe nails were trimmed and when i got home notice they 're not even . cuticles look terrible . gel pain job looks sloppy . will never go there again . nail girl that i got was rude and mean .	2929
1	cream cheese and custard cream `` donuts '' were excellent . not your traditional pastries , but a great find	3229
1	i recently moved to pa. my first experience with this jiffy lube was amazing . well-trained crews with fast action . prices are clear and posted on the wall . waiting area is equipped with free wi fi , coffee and vending machine . truly : i like this place . highly recommended	1592
0	super dirty and falling apart . staff is a bunch of high school kids without an adult manager in site . rides are not manned at all times and gates are held closed with bungee cords . play gym has duct tape holding it together and metal pipes not covered properly . never going back . yikes .	3791
0	i thought my dinner at the covenant was not good . i ordered the roasted chicken , which came out with yellowish skin ( not well roasted ) , and not the 1/2 chicken as advertised -- a breast and some weird lumpy chicken-like pieces that looked like fat and skin and a little meat . the potatoes were ok but billed as `` truffled '' ; i do n't like truffles so was happy that there was no truffle flavor . i would not recommend this restaurant .	1331
1	i went there tuesday . it was very clean . the people were very nice , friendly and rather speedy .. defiantly would recommend & go back ! ! !	2686
1	i 've been coming here to see dominique for the past 8 months or so . i 'm asian and my hair is the brightest/lightest blonde color . it never gets brassy and i do n't get split ends . i love it ! i do n't even know how he does it and i do n't care .	2274
1	i enjoyed my week in this motel last week . clean , great bed , next to restaurants , close to shopping , charming downtown willoughby , the freeways . well kept , beautiful flowering grounds , ease of parking . very reasonably priced . altogether a wonderful experience that i will repeat .	3160
1	i had a wonderful experience from start to finish . the installer mark was great and heather in the office was fabulous ! ! recommend highly	2444
1	this is a lovely place . the staff superb and room service prices perfect and no guilt indulgence for a few days off . my only complain was i could never find a closet to hang my cloth ... i dont think there was one . if going on a bussines trip call ahead and ask if they have a closet or somewhere to hang your cloth . make sure to have a car because is not close to the mall or restaurants . still and incredible getaway and perfect view of the golf course .	187
1	i go here all the time . they do change staff frequently , but the baristas are friendly and the location is convenient . i drink my iced vanilla latte daily . i love the espresso at starbucks and the frequent customer card gives me free syrup and free drinks . the breakfast sandwiches are awesome and are only $ 2 this week .	3396
1	5 star service ! jacob went above and beyond great customer service . we would definitely be going back to this location for our needs . thanks again jacob and staff at the decatur petsmart ! ! ! ! !	2108
1	i was concerned after reading the reviews but all my concerns were abated . there was security , but there was n't anything extreme about them . drinks are priced at club prices . the venue was clean . i felt no anxiety about the area . sound was good . not a lot of decor but i was there for voltaire , not the scenery . we 'd come back .	17
0	ordered food and came to pick it up 45 mom later . not ready ... . they said to me , it 's friday ! waited another 15 mins . not i 'm sorry , we screwed up , not anything close . will never repeat . sushi is mediocre .	41
1	coffee and bagels ! very good ! if you love coffee and bagels and i do you will not be disappointed here ! everything is so fresh , and good quality , if you can think of a bagel and something to put on it ( or just order off the menu ) you will not be disappointed , i promise . might have gotten 5 stars , but i would have liked to see the shop just a bit cleaner , not gon na stop me from going back .	477
0	very rude and disrespectful staff . empty chairs and did not want to seat us . been to plenty of hookah lounges and this one was by far the worst . vegas 's best is olive lounge .	1229
1	best boneless chicken wings ever ! ! ! they have great service . everything is awesome on the menu . the fact that they have golden tee is the icing on the cake ! ! ! best sports bar in town ! ! !	428
1	russ the manager took care of me ! so kind ! everyone here was quick and friendly ! ! he even hooked me with a new phone case and screen .	1237
0	they 've got the best pizza in town . the service is completely unreliable , whether they 're busy or not . bring your appetite and your patience .	87
0	it 's disappointing that the hair salon uses straight bleach for coloring hair instead of adding color . the woman who did my hair was kind , but truly did an outdated job of adding highlights . i had to get my hair re-done somewhere else twice to fix what she did- chunky streaks instead of blending and the bleach has left it so dry- would not recommend .	510
1	great experience with sales and delivery for my daughter 's bed for her first apartment off campus . she has said mattress is extremely comfortable . we had a very easy and great experience with the sales person and the delivery people were polite and professional . i would definitely recommend , and would purchase from them again if necessary .	321
1	friendly and helpful service . they helped me with my pool cover rebate and even carried my purchases to the car . ill return to leslie 's for other pool supplies .	3311
0	5 weeks for a lens repair . paid them in may but they claimed the parts did n't ship until last week . 7 days to ship from new york to arizona . they must have used pony express . i had a ups ground package arrive from the east coast arrive in 4 days . is this length of repair time normal ? i hope they do good work because the repair cost me almost 35 % the value of the lens ... it was a zoom function issue . nothing wrong with the glass or electronics .	633
1	this place is so beautiful ! very chic . the display cakes are jaw-dropping . they do cakes for celebrities , so you will not be disappointed in the cake design ! i love the cheesecake and macarons . they 're giant ! my personal favorite was probably the mint chocolate one , the one where they put an entire girl scout cookie inside . they 're open very late , so you 'll love it if you get a late night sweet craving . and they serve wine ! great for a ladies ' night out , or date night ! brenda is super sweet and helpful !	981
0	i ca n't comment on their work because i have tried twice to get them to come by and give me an estimate for some landscaping ( my times were very flexible ) . both times i was told that they would come and both times no one followed through or showed up . i can only assume they do n't want my business . newsflash , guys , we are paying customers , and this is no way to run a business . i 'm very disappointed because it appears that when they show up they do good work , but i need them to come when they say they will .	2139
0	after being reassured by my insurance company that i could get the exam i needed here , i was rudely informed by the person at the front desk that they never do that here . when asked why i would have been told that she said did n't know but they do n't do it . rude front desk and since that is your first impression , it does n't say much for the rest of the place .	2580
1	it 's starbucks , what more can you say ? they 're consistent with every other location i 've been to , so they kept the status quo .	438
1	great truck accessory shop . i dealt with matt there after i was referred by two friends to the shop . i needed s hitch for my truck . they were excellent on customer service , well stocked showroom and good prices . next will be wheels , tires and lift .	203
0	wait is way too long . needs more staffing and brighter customer service . i know economy is tight and all but removing sides for the $ 7 and $ 8 sandwiches for bagel chips ... not impressed .	1125
0	one the worse experience i 've ever had ordering food from a restaurant . oyster omelet was cold , hard , sandy and had a very bad odor to it . at first glance it almost looked like a pile of scrambled eggs . taiwanese vermicelli was very bland and had chunks of some sort of gelatin . as if they reheated left over food from the day before . fried chicken skin was dry and stale . overall i would n't recommend anyone trying this restaurant .	566
1	this giant eagle is a perfect one to go to . they have a great selection of prepared food and more options to choose from . it is in a safe location and i can easily hop on the bus to go there . the only thing i do n't like about this giant eagle is everything in giant eagle is outrageously expensive .	3430
1	from the woman who checked me in , the young lady who took my vitals , and the physician . i was in and out within 20 minutes , waited on with respect and top quality care . i recommend this location oppose to the urgent care off 16th st and thomas ( where was treated like a robot by their physician 's assistant and i wo n't ever go back ) . thank you banner urgent care saturday night staff ! no need for blow up hands , other than giving a high five ... great experience !	2906
1	i 'm happy they finally have a dunkin ' donuts close to luke afb ! the staff is friendly , but the the drive thru wait time is ridiculous . with time and exposure , the speed should get better .	1774
0	my husband tans here regularly because they seem to have better beds than some salons , however the service is very inconsistent . my husband has driven to the location at opening time and on a few occasions the person opening shows up 15+ minutes late . pretty unprofessional , huh ? they should considering hiring a more reliable person to open the store . the lady that showed up late , does however arrive with a cup of hot coffee . she should probably consider skipping the coffee to arrive on time .	980
1	great authentic tacos , gorditas , and quesadillas for cheap . rated by food network as great comfort food . fast service , likeable staff .	270
1	it 's like they put a west 6th bar in the ville bartenders are amazing and the atmosphere is unbeatable . guaranteed to find a girl to take home every time you go there during the weekend	1200
1	i like this canadian tire a lot . for a downtown store , it seems to be pretty spacious . sometimes stuff is n't laid out in the most logical fashion . for example , i 've been on a frustrating quest for leaf bags and taken forever to find them . why are they at the end of the kitchen appliances aisle instead of in the gardening aisles ? otherwise , it 's a pretty decent canadian tire . i really like the fact that its a dog friendly store . if i ever have to ask for assistance to find a product , the employees here are actually helpful .	2520
1	this is the best village inn i have been to i all of my life and they serve good food the help is always good and helpful and the place is always clean	1029
1	where do you go during blizzard conditions in pittsburgh - kelly 's bar and lounge . we walked in and parked at the bar . there was a great vibe with a diverse crowd . the music selection was great with many alternative / punk tunes playing . we just walked in for drinks . i will be back . atmosphere - great vibe , great music , lotsa people service - the bartenders were preoccupied as some reviewers mentioned but i did not have problem getting our drinks price - great ( one of the cheaper places i have visited in pitt )	279
0	the sandwich may be good and the restaurant clean but what would it happen if you need to use the bathroom ? ? good question ! ! ! there is none totally gross and not up to code , , wonders how come city of henderson allows them to do business ! ! ! !	870
0	the building is nice , but the wifi internet is about the slowest i 've ever encountered at any starbucks ( perhaps good enough for mobile phone users , but way too slow for laptop users ) . the small starbucks down the street ( in the bank of america building ) has blazing fast starbucks google internet , but for some reason this much larger starbucks on casino center dr. does not . service also seems to be a bit lacking , perhaps because of the additional drive-thru traffic ( e.g. , i ordered a hot tea , and did not receive a sleeve on my cup ) .	1996
0	have been trying to get a hold of doug hale the general manager about my issues with my mattress for a month . no response . all i see on the website is how customer service is # 1 . crickets . wish i would n't have listened to brad lewis when he said he would fit me to a mattress . a year later it sags just like the cheap warehouse mattress you get for $ 500 .	2003
1	there was a little confusion with my appointment but they were quick to fix it and then did not charge me my co pay . tina , the store manager , and her team went above and beyond .	1345
0	if i could this place no stars i would . worst customer service ever ! i walked in at 5:30 pm for a gel manicure and was told that they were unable to provide me service . the shop closes at 7 and the place was not busy at all . i travel and the the owner could n't even accommodate me .	1783
0	this place had great interior design , but their cook should change profession immediately , i think food and service was the reason why the place immediately shut down !	729
1	excellent service ! on a busy saturday with no appointment i was greeted at the door immediately . work was completed in about 45 min . had a screw in one tire that we had just recently had replaced at this same location . they were able to remove the screw at no charge . they replace the valve every time they dismount a tire , so ask about that ahead of time if you have any concerns . will definitely keep coming back !	3158
1	wow ! ! ! i was starting a grooming class last minute and needed clippers and some blades . i asked ryan 's how much next day shipping would cost $ 98.00 . i said never mind , just send it regular ups . two days later i got a package from fed ex . it 's been a long time sense a company made me feel like my business mattered . thank you ryan 's ... .. you got my business for now on ... ..	3904
1	okay okay ... if your looking for karaoke in calgary look no further than ducky 's . with a bathroom straight out of train spotting and a wafting odor ... like the underpants of your girlfriend after a night of dancing to marky mark in a 90 's club ... this place is a straight up black light thoroughfare of lyrical murder . ps . order the peas and carrots .	3164
1	i absolutely love the way the owners have created a family friendly gym that 's also inexpensive ! i 'm all about supporting local businesses and this gym is definitely a local fav !	2750
1	my wife and i have been going here for around 8 months and really like the smaller feel , although it can be crowded during the normal busy hours just like every gym we have been to . our trainer lisa is great and continues to push us to be stronger .	3898
1	i love a good sandwich ... firehouse does n't dissapoint ! the wife and i were very pleased with their selection and the quality . i just finished my meatball sandwich and can honestly say , it 's the best i 've ever had .	1494
1	i have n't had any bad experiences at this store . staff is always friendly and helpful . i especially like the array of office chairs in the back .	1782
1	house music i 'm there . the venue was very crappy i 'll admit that but when you hear the music they are playing you just want to dance . yeah you will see some strange people there after 3am . i saw a guy rolling on the couch and a girl giving him a shitty light show . i took one star away because well not that many people there and if you want to bust your moves you can . oh yeah drinks are very water down no alchohal at all . beware : if you house there you might attract some gay people and they will probably dance infront of you .	3568
0	i was n't impressed at all . too cramped . it was so difficult to even go to the bathroom without losing my standing spot crunched on stairs that i held it . could n't get to the bar . no service once there . only good thing was delta rae .	225
0	i came in with a couple pairs of pants that needed alterations . they were too long and i needed them shortened . when i got them back , the hems were not straight , the legs uneven , and they decided to iron a crease into the middle of my pant legs on one of my pants ( only one , left the other alone ) - leaving a visible , unwanted crease . these pants were new and i feel they were ruined .	3484
1	i ride up the escalator and head straight to this coffee place . it 's faster than mcd ( which has a wicked long line nine times out of ten ) when i just want a cup of tea . a very hipster place in the airport , but i like it . the workers are eclectic and efficient both things i appreciate .	2804
1	perfect acrylic and shellac service here ! the salon is clean and well-decorated.the owner is really sweet as well . highly recommended .	2050
0	i would not recommend this shop . this shop has undeniably the worst customer service i have ever received anywhere . do not go here if you have a question or want assistance . be prepared to pay a fortune for things you can get with awesome service down the street at another shop . horrible experience rude people	2895
0	for the price of their pho , their portion size is small compared to other pho places . it 's quite expensive . the soup is okay and i found the noodles kind of hard . parking is very limited here and you 'll often find yourself waiting for a spot during lunch and dinner time .	577
1	came here again but 3yrs later and with a different car for the same ac issue . travis was awesome , very professional and knows what he is talking about . a plus is they never tried to up sell me on anything	565
0	for the third time now in one month their machines have messed up while i 'm trying to go through on my monthly pass . i sat in the queue for 10 minutes honking my horn until i finally had to get out and go find someone to try to help me . after another 10 minutes i just decided it 's time to use a different car wash service . as convenient as this is to my house i would rather go somewhere where i can actually get serviced .	2939
1	dr torres is an amazing doctor	3059
0	staff was rather unfriendly . contrary to what is posted on yelp , this laundromat is only open until 9:00 p.m . i found out the hard way .	2638
1	they are the only company we trust our hvac system with gregory who came out today is extremely knowledgeable and really wants you to feel good with service provided	1718
1	the smell you get from this place as you walk up to it is enchanting . being portuguese i basically took the reigns for ordering for my friends the chicken was amazing perfectly tender with crispy fries and an awesome spicy sauce . if i lived in montreal this place would be the death of me . i also bought 6 pastel de nata ( custard dessert with a flaky crust ) by far the best version i 've had in a while . i usually get them in ct but these were defiantly memorable . btw you get a 1/2 chicken fries and salad for 9.95 theres no beating that .	1109
0	we come and stay at the orleans about 3 times a year for 4 days at a time for the past 3 years . we 've only been to koji once , we 've only had sushi , and we have n't returned . we were not impressed . the 5 rolls we ordered were very small and kind of sloppy . the taste was `` meh '' at best - not so bad i wanted to spit it out , but definitely not something that would justify the prices . i think we 'll travel around the area looking for another sushi spot .	1196
1	new entry in my top tier of coffeeshops/tea shops in vegas . their products are fairly high quality ( not cheap , but not overpriced ) . seating is reasonably comfortable . and convenient to some good restaurants . they were fairly busy when i was there , which is a good thing for them but be forewarned seats may be difficult to come by .	2984
0	horrible customer service experience ; could n't even get past the receptionist . refused verified insurance coverage , inaccurate cash pricing , poor attitude . overall an underwhelming and less than positive experience .	272
0	worst service from people who clearly do n't care . waiting 20 minutes for nobody to acknowledge my presence . never going back again .	2375
1	if you 're looking for an authentic , traditional haircut and hot towel shave , this is the place to go ! the atmosphere is clean and professional , and the barbers are extremely skilled and friendly . i left mesa with the freshest haircut of my life ! i will definitely be coming back ! danny and luis , keep doing what you 're doing !	1551
1	wow , i felt like i was back in brooklyn for a minute or two . great selection of better pastas and did i see goat cheese ravioli ? i will have to try that next time . they ha many of the italian specialty things i search for . some nice lunch sandwiches as well .	283
0	spring 2017 race-all this hype about a second race in 2018 and you ca n't even provide good customer service now . petty grandstands ran out of water ... could n't buy a bottle anywhere . shame on you ! you do n't deserve the extra business if you ca n't fix the problems .	2955
0	never got to try as they closed early- called to make sure they would be open and when we called at 8:45 said closing early ... planned on picking up pastries for christmas . oh well- will try somewhere more reliable .	1160
0	the guys are the worst . if they show up at all they will contaminate your house as they come with 1 rag to clean the toilet and dust your furniture . these people are real phonies .	2854
1	been here on a sunday in summer of 08 . the dj , venue , and everything was on point . was looking forward to coming back this summer but heard it was replaced with vanity .	3596
0	the hostess was extremely rude when our group walked in . she exclaimed a profanity upon seeing our group and said `` oh great , 10 people that are going to just go straight to the bar '' . we feel sorry for her and her opportunities in life with such a poor attitude . the fact that there was only 5 other people in the bar , you 'd think they would be happy to see new people walking in ... we do not recommend this business .	717
1	this is a pretty good mexican chain . the chips and salsa are very good , and so was the margarita 's . the enchalata 's i ordered were average .	1558
0	i took 2 skirts in to be hemmed . the woman who waited on me was very rude with an entitlement attitude ! then she wanted me to pay for the alterations before they were done . i told her i would need to see if they were done satisfactorily before paying , as in every other service . she was quite insulted and informed me they could not do them then . fine with me . i would suggest going elsewhere .	2702
1	pacific landscape is by far the best landscaping company in vegas ! very customer friendly . very good prices . i highly recommend them to anyone and everyone . marc the owner is very knowledgable as well , he knows how to properly keep the yard looking awesome ! the design he drew up for me was absolutely beautiful and it looks even better now that it 's my yard . not big into writing reviews but i had to after the awesome service they provided for me .	2357
1	yesterday we come back to nice nails total 4 girls . this place is my fave place i been here many times for pedi mani with shellac today all my friends very happy with theirs mani shellac the staff take . time to do their job the salon very clean the staff very friendly we very happy we will be back	1866
0	i normally do not leave reviews but holy crap . all i wanted was my eyebrows waxed and i told her just a little touch up please i still like my brows thick . and she waxed them so thin wayyyy to thin . and on top of all this she got wax in my hair . and was just so aggressive and not friendly at all . very disappointing	686
1	thanks to reading yelp reviews i found our new local wing place . used to frequent township grill years ago and thrilled to learn that the owners resurfaced at crossroads . we 've had the regular buffalo and carolina wings . carolina is my go-to for a little added sweetness . calling in takeout orders is super easy with the friendly staff .	1248
1	we really ended up here , because it was the only place that was open on an awkwardly late sunday night . the waitress was very friendly , and really wanted us to get the best drinks possible . i had the carrot cake cocktail , with cream cheese frosting and all . it was good , different good , everyone else loved , while i just liked it . me being me , thought it was a little pricey at $ 18 a drink , but hey , yolo . i would want to come back to also try the food , just during a little bit earlier in the day .	456
0	you cant be that rude to people when the nail service you put out is mediocre at best .	3607
0	i can see why these guys have such a low rating . poor experience the first time when i went in for a simple car wash and all they wanted to do was upsell me on additional services ( which i reluctantly purchased ) . the actual wash left half of my car i vacuumed . when i returned to use those services ( detail mats ) , they again pushed selling me more and were reluctant to honor the services i had already purchased .	1502
1	i use my chase~ ink card & my cahse ; ) freedom ) '' . card for all my purchases on yelp n the staff at chase banking centers are always so freindly n help with all my banking needs .	2983
1	the pickle barrel is quite good . they are willing to accommodate a large group at last minute notice as well . : ) the portion sizes are quite big and the prices are very very reasonable . their menu is quite large so you will have plenty of option to choose from . they have a very good smoothie/milkshake menu as well which is perfect for the non alcoholic drinkers like myself . : ) i was quite impress with my food . i paid $ 13.99 for egg plant parmesan , with spaghetti and a side of cesar salad .	534
1	i love this place . the kids mac and cheese is the best ! i was n't a fan of the truffle mac and cheese though . the impossible burger was so yummy ! the only reason i 'm not giving a 5 star is because of the truffle mac and cheese and the buffalo cauliflower . it was basically just boiled cauliflower with hot sauce . would highly recommend this place though ! ca n't wait to go back .	1405
1	the pizza is yummy . the crust is soft and chewy on the inside with just the right amount of crunch on the outside . even just the plain cheese pizza is tasty . not too greasy and does n't flop around when you pick it up . the people in the shop are super friendly and personable .	1521
1	awesome salon ! very clean & professional ! been coming here 2 years now . i recommend to friends & co-workers . lovely family business . free wi-fi . massage , waxing & eyelash extensions . angela does the best mani/pedi & eyelash extensions . perfect shellac & choice of colours . i am a loyal customer . free parking in back or side streets . starbucks & timothy a few doors down . i brought my friend for a facial & he loved it . try the 15 minute chair massage too ! love it & ca n't beat the price ! ! !	3516
1	top notch service and workmanship ! i have been coming to firestone for years because of how clean and neat the facility is . this location it one of the best i have been to . i never leave here feeling ripped off , i have never had an issue with customer service or quality of work . ian and that staff today blew me away from the time i walked in to checking out , i felt good about to whole experience . i will always come to firestone and recommend to all my friends and family for all my automotive needs .	2212
1	its a 3 star and thats what we got . if youre looking for 5 star ... then sure you might not be happy . i thought this was a nice hotel . primarily because the staff was just awesome ! louis was one of my favs , and i cant remember the other guys name . but they were great ! the front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating . the free espresso and/or tea was also a huge perk . it was a bit cold so we didnt walk a lot , but when it finally warmed up we could walk anywhere . great location cons : wifi was awful , but at least its free	1680
0	hurts donuts lost a customer today . which i 'm super bummed about . i drove the 40 minutes over to hurts to get a donut shake and half dozen donuts . i pulled up and the guy said he would only sell me the half dozen . i would have to go inside to the order the shake . wait ? why do you even have a drive thru ? there was a sign that no single donut sales in the drive thru . okay ? but by my calculations , that 's 7 . i thanked the guy and said no thank you . i left . i wo n't ever make the mistake of going to hurts again .	2053
1	food is consistently good . we often go for weekend brunch . i 'm from nj , which has a lot of 24 hour diners . this is one of the only places in madison that offers breakfast all day , so it 's great in my book . do n't come if you mind long lines or kids ; do come if you like yeasted doughnuts !	975
1	fiesta pools is such a wonderful company . they work in such a professional and timely manner . i would recommend them .	2721
1	just got done signing up for my sister and i 's gym membership and the atmosphere was amazing ! everyone was so nice and accommodating , especially jason , ben , and devon , coming from previous management the improvement is phenomenal i would definitely recommend this gym to anyone !	3446
1	high end golf club with very well maintained course & professional staff . primarily open to members , but will take non members if booked through online golf app , golfnow	259
0	there are tons of reputable charlotte ac businesses - use one of them instead . these guys are nothing but a scam .	1803
1	excellent service ! i would highly recommend this company ! price was right . car was clean and looked brand new . the driver , steve , was very professional and i felt very comfortable letting him drive my daughter to the airport . that says a lot ! ! ! when you call , ask for nina ! she was great , too ! my go to company from now on ! ! !	455
0	food is good , long wait ( 30 min from order to table ) overly loud , not enough trash can spots like in chopt- preferred salad spot ) seriously over priced for the amount of food . always happy to support local but not when the value is n't there .	1269
0	i had tom and he did not do a good job and i got charged $ 260 . i asked for a black to blonde ombre and the ombre was very uneven . and the colour was a really weird brown colour . on top of it my hair was so dry .	3697
0	first time at this location . probably the dumbest idea ever to put both drive up atms right next to each other ! ! i do n't know why anyone would do such a thing .	2760
1	great late night eatery ! or after shopping snack pizza 's pretty good like the owners going from table to table greeting the customers , showing family pics and food awards of course its $ 5 a slice , can you imagine the rent ? i 'll be back for sure !	1371
0	very similar to panera bread . however when the employee dropped my salad off at my table i was completely grossed out . i 'm uploading some photos of my plate . there were thumb prints and greasy wipe marks all over the outside of my salad plate . it looked like it had n't been washed in weeks . also my friend asked for a side of chips with their sandwich ( which comes free with it ) and we somehow got a side of chips plus the chips on the plate with the sandwich . we checked the receipt and we were charged twice for chips ... even though they come free with a sandwich order ! ? ! awful	1387
0	today i was seated outside the cafe while having lunch . it was quite windy and at one point the wind blew over our table umbrella and spilt my smoothie . i went back in hoping they would replace it because i had not started drinking it yet . but the manager refused to do so . that to me is poor customer service . i have been going here for the past 2 years but will never go back after this . hopefully they stop being so inconsiderate !	3225
0	spa is ok. green valley ranch really needs to step their game up . broken trash cans and empty water features prove the lack of attention to detail . hopefully things improve over here . outdoor pool area is nice tho .	2651
0	nice and cool and dark and all but they neglected to give me a treat receipt for a week . they gave one to a woman in front of me who ordered a regular coffee and i ordered a grande americano and did n't get one . disappointed . the starbucks at 10 dundas east has better customer service .	3294
0	no one even came up to us to ask us if we needed help . horrible service . i understand my husband and i look very young and they might not take us serious as buyers , but seriously ? i 'm disappointed with their customer service .	2659
1	i had been to the location downtown & loved it , this summerlin location is fairly new . great food & plenty of coffee/drink options . friendly staff , ordered the empanada platter & chilaquiles , of course the chilaquiles are made with a slight twist , yet still tasty ! new hot spot for summerlin , worth trying .	1332
0	i ordered flowers through 1-800-flowers and the order was fulfilled through this location . i 've attached pictures of what i ordered versus what was received . do n't expect to get what you paid for , and do n't expect for any issues to be resolved in a timely manner if you use this florist . after calling back 4 times over the course of the past week , the redelivery is supposed to be today before 4pm . i sincerely hope that they redeem themselves , i 'll post an update once the new bouquet is received .	38
0	went last night . sadly disappointed . save your money . fish over done and dry . see pictures of carrots . waste of $ 150 never again . no wonder locations are closing . positive notes : server was great , pear salad awesome . manager does n't like criticism . not accommodating	1534
1	i have nothing bad to say about this particular starbucks . i was met with nothing short of friendly , punctual , and above and beyond service . my drink screamed delicious and they even told me about the exclusive rewards program they offer which in the end would save me money . it is an outdoor starbucks considering it 's inside of the outlet mall . decent amounts of seating and a more than visible menu that is n't complete but has all the favorites and well known menu items everybody loves . below are a few pictures i snapped just so you guys have a good idea of what to expect if you 're ever in the neighborhood .	1797
0	i strongly recommend that you do not hire college movers . we attempted to hire college movers to move a three bedroom row house . they failed to book a crew , but did not tell us about the problem until two days before the move was scheduled . they told us not to worry that they would get a crew . then at 10 pm on a saturday night they emailed us ( did not call ! ) to tell us they would not be coming the next morning . we ended up renting the last truck in pittsburgh and begging all of our friends to help us at the last minute .	1666
0	whose **** do i need to suck to get a drink around here ? oh joy . the owner 's . the tired bartenders are over worked and under staffed . when they are n't being molested by their boss they may have time to service you . this is too painful a scene , which could very well lead to more drinking.. fortunately , i have money to purchase a drink , so ill be at hideaway west .	792
1	we got there at 3:30 with a sick baby and we 're told it would be a 3 hrs . but within 10-15 mins we were pulled back , he got his vitals checked and giving a private room to wait . by 5:30 we were done and out . the staff in the back was great and showed care for our son .	2517
0	i found the food overooked , very odd flavouring - one pad thai dish simply unedible and a noodle soup blan , skimpy and uninteresting . i was not compensated for returning the dishes-paid full price and left . this is my first 1 rating ever . not recommended .	594
0	called office twice this morning to make an appointment to view countertops for home bathrooms . no return calls , really ! ? ! will be calling another showroom . loews is looking very attractive .	3875
0	this was my first and last time here . i got the vanilla bourbon gelato . it was overpriced , and old . it was not creamy , but had started to turn icy . i will go to enzo 's or angel sweet instead . ( enzo 's has awesome cannoli 's )	164
1	this is the best burger i have ever had , it was made super fast , super juicy and the beef was very tender . the lady at the cash register was very courteous and friendly , she even handed back my receipt with double hand , a gesture of gratitude and friendliness . the restaurant and bathroom were clean . this restaurant is highly recommended .	445
0	supervisor `` jason '' was so rude , arrogant , disrespectful and doesnt know how to value customer service . he told me `` leave my store and never come back '' .i 've been a loyal customer since 2013. i love superdry but i do n't think ill ever go back to fashion show branch till `` jason '' is there .	2395
0	drove all the way from northwest las vegas and place is closed , come on its wed at noon ! ! what kind of business do you run ? ? sign says `` closed for thanksgiving '' really ? ? ! what does n't that mean are you closed all week ? ? it 's the day before thanksgiving everywhere is busy and you are closed ! ! wo n't be back !	84
1	steve at mitch 's was way more than a great representative . he was honest and forthright in his analysis of my situation . he recommended what needed to be done and did n't use the usual terror to get me to overspend on a car that may not have worth the investment . his goal was to make me safe on the road and was very accommodating to my $ and time constraints . mission accomplished . thank you steve and your excellent team as well .	1854
0	horrible staff members at the office , the dispatcher pamela is very rude and aggressive lady . she uses inappropriate jargon on the phone and literally told me to shut up , and hang up the phone . when i called back she put me on speaker and was rude to me and the driver . i feel very terrible that someone yelled at me on the phone . when i asked if i could speak to the manager she said `` i am the manager , you have a problem ? '' . customer service is below 0 . the driver was very nice and professional his name is oliver .	3717
0	despite being leery of any place that calls itself an `` eatery '' , i have been to combine twice now ( with 2 and 3 people ) and ordered different items each time . sad to say it 's hit and miss with nothing in between : either wonderful fresh flavours , or utterly bland . decor is also lacking flavour . got ta say if you 're depending on a hot sauce for flavour then the food is not doing its job . also : what 's with the pepper mill pushing in a mex-ish restaurant ? ? ? ... another signal that combine does n't stand behind their flavours .	273
1	clean , attentive and food was delicious . nice ambience . i was with my 3 yr old daughter . they did n't had crayons but immediately looked for markers and paper . excellent service . pasta portions are generous . they do n't have koda menu but do offer any pasta half for children for $ 6 . my daughter ate all her pasta which was bolognese . i had the vodka which also was great . ingredients seems very fresh and food was delicious . really nice lunch . we were very satisfied .	728
1	food is great . gravy dipping sauce and sweet tea is fantastic . place is clean , general manager is very friendly . everyone should try this place . plus 3 drive thrus	862
0	had lunch , sesame chicken & fried rice . portion was large , but tasteless . owner was attentive and friendly . open kitchen and tables by window . counter service was reasonably quick . the food was better at their old location on guadeloupe/mcclintock . new cook perhaps ? it now occupies the old `` chopstix '' location at the albertson 's shopping center . try china king a few blocks away .	474
0	i got wrong order after waiting 30mins when there was only 2 customer ordered before me . cashier did not speak any english so she was not able to explain the drinks when i ordered . that is how i received my order in correctly . also , i got refund incorrectly so , i showed her how much i supposed to get refund . the quality of my drink was totally bad ! i liked to come here . but now i change my mine . i will not come back ! !	3563
0	i had . friend from out of town . we had the honey toast and the nutella toast . they both were good . my friend ordered an american coffee and they did n't give her sugar nor milk . when we asked they gave her sugar but we had to pay a dollar for milk . i will not be returning. '	1821
0	this is a fine place to meet friends or just sit and watch the action . the service is horrible however . only about 6 other people there when i was there and it took over 20 minutes to get a beer . the waitress never came back and i had to go to the bar for a refill . customer service at this hotel needs an upgrade as much as the hotel itself .	3343
0	rather mediocre coffee and pastries . tables and counter are n't very clean . this place could be much better .	3684
1	frozen chocolate-covered cheesecake on a stick with artificial strawberry swirls . see you in october !	2076
1	i had a great time here . bartenders were quick on their feet . not too much wait . the shows were fun and the music lively . great free judgment zone .	3661
0	once my favorite sushi spot ; it has gone downhill . i went in on a saturday for lunch and was so disappointed that i will never go back . just poor quality fish , no attention to detail . i ordered a spicy tuna hand roll , salmon , hamachi , and unagi , all of it poor quality . i left most of the food on my plate , paid the bill , and left .	198
1	brought the 4runner in @ 2 on a saturday , had it back @ 5:30 . i knew the roters were warped , i needed an oil change , and i had a brake light out . they called with a few options on the brakes , changed the oil and brake light , and did n't try and sell me a bunch of other add ons . friendly service and did what needed to be done .	2552
1	we stayed here through a timeshare marketing pitch..we knew it was going to be a sales process and we knew that going in . we were not planning to buy anything , my wife really liked the deal and convinced me to buy it saying we would travel more ... had a bad case of buyers remorse but decided to try and use it . we stayed at their jockey club in vegas for 3 nights used our points . had a great time and it was easy to use . booked again for tahoe and i have to say so far so good ... feel like we did make a great choice .	1929
1	i do n't know why we never think to get the pizza here but i 'm so glad we did ! the crust is very light and crispy and they do n't drown it in pizza sauce either - the pizza does n't leave you feeling weighted down , tired and greasy after eating it either . next time i 'm trying one with sausage - it sounds like a must try from the other reviews . staff is very nice - will be back	900
0	1 2-star review on 3 brewers 4 poor 5ervice and food . i 've had wonderful experiences at the 3 brewers in the financial district with the great food and beer selection so i thought this one would be no different . the lack of attention from both the service and the kitchen staff is embarrassing . i understand it 's busy , but when you service everybody around us and neglect us in favour of others , it 's distasteful ( get it ? ) . overall , would stick to other locations if you want your 3 brewers fix .	670
1	gin was a great tech . knowledgeable and very polite . will def use your services again . the service call fee was very fair .	1699
0	nourriture fade : œufs brouillés caoutchouteux pancakes qui se délitent . un service à la limite du correct . boissons chaudes non comprises dans les formules .	243
0	we have tried this place 3 times . i always give places more than one chance and this morning was the last straw . not only was the food mediocre but the prices are too steep . manger said 2minutes , it was 30 . then we got seated and overheard a couple who had been waiting 45minites . in this 10minute time of being seated , no one came by to give water or coffee . we walked out 45min later with no breakfast and are headed else where . never again .	1319
0	this is the first and last visit to this restaurant . we ordered the lamb steaks . meal was so so . we both left lots of food on the plate . we had the butternut squash soup and the waiter brought the main course before we had finished it . not good . will never go back . a total waste of money .	534
1	dr. andrea watson gets 5 stars in my book . i was on my way back to phoenix ( driving ) and needed some adjusting for the long car ride . her husband actually saw me the other day before to help loosen my back ( much needed ) . she was on her way to lunch , but i mentioned i was literally heading back right then , and she set aside some time to take care of me . my back gives most people problems , but she was able to handle it ( some credit to the other dr for helping the previous day ) and i felt ready to go for the drive home . very nice and very helpful .	2011
0	although the service was decent ( the waiter was overwhelmed but well intentioned ) the food was lackluster at best . the prices would have matched the quality in any city except in montreal where the cost of this meal could have bought some quality , more flavorful cuisine . do n't come here expecting to leave satisfied . in the heart of a culinary capital like montreal there are better options worth your time and wallet .	574
1	great staff ! very clean and i love how up to date technology wise they are . state of the art equipment .	3752
0	my first time & last time the workers they moved really slow like they did n't care to get the food to the customer & food was prepared very sloppy , like they did n't want to serve us	800
0	zero communication throughout the process . i saw signs around gilbert saying she was going out of business . i have two chairs at the greenfield location . both telephone lines are disconnected i went to the new store - celebratory signs all around of new grand opening . weird . when i asked , the women behind the desk who identified herself as terri , she told me i needed to go on-line `` everything goes through corporate '' . my experience with corporations is more communication and valid telephone numbers . seems dodgy .	2924
0	potato . i collectively ate 1 potato . i ca n't recall if there was meat , but i vividly remember all of the potato . so . much . potato .	783
1	they have really tasty , rich , cakes . great decor . very chill , laid back atmosphere . glad that it 's open late . would definitely recommend for a late night dessert .	2410
1	bought all new appliances for our kitchen . the range had issues right from the start . ge handled the warranty work . after ge came out numerous times and replaced various parts , they finally gave up and said they just wanted to replace the whole thing . however , by that time the exact model was no longer available . we called the manager at the ahwatukee spencer 's and explained the situation . turns out they still had our model in stock in their warehouse . he said they could have the replacement out the next day ... and they did ! very happy with the customer service .	3784
0	first visit after moving into the neighborhood- had very soggy fish and chips to go . sat at the bar to order and service was slow and uninterested . second visit a couple months later with friends on a saturday night , too packed to easily get to the bar for a drink , horrible band with no stage space . drunks were literally tripping over their equipment . maybe i need to give it another chance , but since it is attached to panini 's which offers pretty good bar food , chances are i wo n't ...	1510
0	be careful they charge a corporate rate if you 're short on gas so 1/4 tank will cost you 51 dollars ! they do not make this clear .	3129
0	this is the worst whole foods ive ever been to and ive been to many . i stopped in to grab some food from the hot bar . none of the food was replenished and tje food that was there was undercooked , looked dry or there was no food at all just empty pans . i took the risk and purchased foods anyways never again ! dear whole foods markham please do better .	3271
0	worst manicure , pedicure ever ! for manicure , nails were filed unevenly - different shapes and lengths . he did n't clean up cuticles at all . i have hangnails all over that i did n't have when i went in . he missed sides of several nails when he polished . for pedicure , hot , hot water when i put my feet in . again , nothing done for cuticles and polish is smeared over bottom of toes on skin . worst part , no massage on feet at all and no lotion on hands ! i could n't believe what i was sitting through .	2915
0	very rude costumer ! when i walked in for help , i got ignored then was rudely talked to . sorry , i 'm not an antique expert ! geez ! if you want to make money , you have to be nice to the costumers !	1842
1	visited this asian grocery once as a tourist , i was astounded how big it was ! and the ready-to-eat section have so many variety of food that i normally liked . i could picture myself living in mississauga area without having to cook everyday ! the prices were reasonable too . sometimes i think that north americans in general are blessed with the abundance of convenience that many people on the other parts of the world does n't have . i mean , i ca n't find so many different types of vegetarian milk in my hometown like i did in canada and the states !	2069
1	amazing amazing amazing ! you wo n't be disappointed ! rosa is fantastic . patient , caring and amazing at cutting wiggly kids hair .	3548
1	this is a very nice , updated hampton inn with reasonable prices . in my opinion though , what really makes a hotel a five star hotel is the hospitality , and sharon at the front desk is the bomb diggity . her excellent customer service made me feel well taken care of after a particularly long and exhausting day . i guess you could say i 'm really just giving sharon 5 stars here . the hotel is fortunate to have someone like her rocking customer service into the wee hours of the night !	2583
1	great value ! went here for mother 's day lunch and the lunch combos offered soup , salad , rice , then 2 of the following chicken/steak/cod/beef ribs , mixed veggies and dessert for no more than $ 12 !	516
1	i went yesterday as a drop-in client . i got in right away . the staff was very nice and professional , and the salon was clean and comfortable . i had a full set of acrylic overlays done on my natural nails . they look fantastic ! ! it was $ 30 plus tip which is very reasonable . i will be back !	3711
1	i got diesel at this `` chevron '' in chandler , az on 12/11/2009 for my r.v . `` the black pearl '' . it was my first time there . the prices were competitive .	2681
0	awful ! do n't waste your time ! i 've waited three days for just an estimate ! they act like they 're doing you a favor . does n't return calls/texts , very unprofessional ! i 've waited for 3 days and still nothing , wasted my time , i could 've been looking elsewhere . update : the owner contacted me after i text him that he was unprofessional and he said ( text ) , `` i was going to give you a free estimate , but if you want to pay , i can come now . '' i have the text as proof ! who charges for an estimate ? wow . mind blown . beware of this company !	2387
0	might as well buy new - this place charges so much - it 's not a deal . not only that i tried to sell them a treadmill - they offered practically nothing for it - then i look at how much they charge - sheesh . this place takes advantage of people who are desperate to sell stuff and sells it at a rip off price . i officially hate this place .	2781
1	other than cora 's , i really do n't know any other brunch places uptown . i am so glad my friend introduced me to mains mansion . when i want to get my brunch fix , this is where i go ! the portions are generous , the food is flavourful and the best part has to be the variety of fruit you get on your plate ! it inspires me to recreate their dishes and host a brunch at home and invite friends over ! until that happens , i will look forward to trying the veggie eggs benny and the farmers breakfast and the waffles on my next subsequent visits !	1037
1	in our quest to dine at all sun prairie restaurants ... i 'm not sure how glass nickel fell under our radar . you ca n't live in this area without knowing their pizza and once again they did n't disappoint . we loved the atmosphere too ... . right down to the trivia pursuit questions at each table .	1519
1	love this place ! ! ! great beer selection ! ! ! walk over to a non pretentious bar and have a great time ! i wish it was n't so busy all the time ! ! ; )	3039
0	it 's soooo ovvveeerrrprrrrriiiiiiced . in phoenix where outstanding , authentic options are nearly limitless , there is no reason to charge $ 3 for a single taco that can be consumed in literally 2 bites . they do n't offer anything that a classic , unassuming hole-in-the-wall does n't do as well or better for a fraction of the cost .	270
0	my lawyer has tried several attempts to rectify the situation with the manager irwin , ivan , whatever his name is and is not cooperating . you ca n't change a story when i literally have proof of everything . add in proof from the two places in which you `` claimed '' to have fixed the car '' and i have you so far in a corner you have no where to go . i always thought the manger was like a rat , go figure .	1926
0	terrible customer service . transferred around 3 times and nobody was willing to check on an item for me . i was super sick and expected the staff to be somewhat helpful but they were rude and lazy .	929
1	cute irish pub with a good menu selection . good place to relax and have a pint however and it can get quite loud at times . would n't go out of my way to make a visit but if you 're in the area stop in !	1064
0	they charge for every little thing . will not go back to this location . workers needs some attitude adjustments	1365
1	love this place . offers an expansive selection & the staff is always very friendly ! i recommend coming during the week as the weekend seems plenty more busy	2071
0	the dealership promotes themselves as one that gives you their best price the first time around . that appeared to be exactly how they operated and they did n't change their numbers . it was somewhat annoying however to have them advertise a car ( used ) at one price on their website and then tell us that the price was higher . it was a quick experience to take a test drive , get a price on their car and have our trade in evaluated . their overall price on our trade in was lower than we could get elsewhere and their 'firm ' price on their used car was higher than what we found at other dealerships for the same car .	307
1	i am really pleased with my gel nails that were done by nikki ! she even asked if i wanted an additional coat , which nail salons never do . it 's been a week and my nails still look amazing .	3508
1	deana is a gem . listened to exactly what i wanted . best haircut of my entire life . very pleased .	1746
0	i 've never been to o charleys before now and i probably wont ever go back . i wish i could say it was just the staff that was rude . but it was also the food . steak was undercooked and so was chicken . mashed potatoes were crusty ? how 's that even possible . and then to top it off we had trouble with the bill . the manager was friendly and apologized . look elsewhere before settling on this resturant .	1549
1	i love their coffee ! it 's delicious , never tastes old . also , their prices are great in comparison to starbucks , and the flavor is much better than cheaper coffee , like mcdonald 's or burger king . i would give it 5 stars but sometimes they are really busy and have long lines , and a few times they have gotten my order wrong . p.s . try the hashbrowns . they 're amazing !	1131
0	terrible service ! i got a simple pedicure and they had to fix it three times . then when i got home there was still bubbles and bumps on my toe nails .	2362
1	i have been a customer for the last 7 years and have always had a positive experience with sierra . their customer service and their technicians are always courteous and knowledgeable . just had my summer tune up today performed by derek s. and as usual i am totally satisfied . also a thank you to the customer service rep that kept me updated as to my appointment time .	1718
1	i frequent this starbucks on a daily basis during the work week . recently i 've gotten in the bad habit of also making an afternoon trip for a second coffee ( bad , i know ) . this is the closest location to my office and always has my mobile order ready quickly . the staff is great and they 've never messed up my drink . this location does seem to run out of cold brew more often than not . they also have a small seating area that 's usually full when i 'm there ( right after lunch ) . the few tables they have out front are in direct sunlight .	2358
0	i 've been with state farm for over twenty years and have had agents in many different states and jen sias has been the worst by far . there has been so much trouble just to get on autopay , it is laughable . very slow to get anything done and error prone . i love state farm and will continue to use them , but i highly recommend you look elsewhere for your agent .	2675
0	terrible service . literally sat at the bar in front of the bartender for 20 mins while he ignored us . then a couple sat down right beside us and the bartender introduced himself to them and served them right away . at that point i got up and walked out	97
0	let me start with this as you walk in the first establishment on the right is empty it 's one of those malls that you literally have to avoid making eye contact with the employees in the kiosks down the middle of the hallway they will literally pressure you with all kinds of stuff really making you feel awkward and uncomfortable if you shop at dillards or jcpenney 's or sears great other then that the mall has nothing to offer i would say 1/5 of the rental space is boarded up really a horrible experience	2815
1	i 'm so sad they closed it . i used to go to this bk because it 's close to my work . the staff is pretty bored but they are cool though . i 'm usually blasting them out with music so when i do n't have it on they ask where the music is at . they have gotten all my orders correct for the most part . they could use some help at making sure the hamburgers are hotter because i would think they let the patties sit in the trays too long sometimes . i 'd like to see bk bring the debit card pin pads back at least inside because they accepted android/apple pay previously .	458
0	i will never let my children go to such an out of control place ! ! ! ! the employers and supervisor were nasty and unwilling to listen to accusations that were made about my children . the supervisor does not know conflict resolution . my children were kicked out without having the chance to tell their side of the story . they called the police without reason ! my child went outside to wait for the rest of the family and the supervisor followed him out to continue harassing him when he was standing on the side walk . when i called to discuss the matter , the supervisor hung up on me ! do not take your children to this insane asylum !	1664
1	consistently delicious , the go-to dishes being the lucy , squash poutine , cheese steak sandwich . i usually walk out of there having spent $ 25 on myself and feeling satisfied . not 5 stars because : can be long wait , especially if more than 2 people . if it 's a busy night the servers sometimes try and rush you out . service is hit or miss .	688
0	if i could do less than one star i would . these people came out after we had a home inspector tell us there was corrosion all over one of the pipes showing an obvious very slow leak . i could see the slow leak . they refuse to replace it telling the home warranty that they could not see an active leak just corrosion . dumbass where do you think the corrosion comes from . wo n't ever allow them on one of my properties again .	910
1	belsito saved my day ! ! ! i am having a dinner party in a matter of hours , and the garbage disposal broke , causing a flood under my sink . from the time i called to the time it was fixed , under 1.5 hours ! jim was beyond professional , and honest in his repair . very fair pricing , and the voucher from yelp ( $ 50 for $ 100 ) was just an added bonus . belsito has my business for life ! !	1473
0	always low on stock , store is a mess so i wo n't be coming to that location no more i think it 's worth driving to 24th st instead .	3107
1	these guys went above and beyond when it came time to get new headlights in my car . their customer service is on point , and these people who know what they are doing/talking about .	2850
1	great place to stay people are friendly and they have recently upgraded the hotel looks very nice	3248
1	wonderful service . 1st visit - just moved from reno and got to say that i was very impressed by my advisor and costs were very reasonable ! ! thank you !	2133
1	food was good and served quickly . the customer service was great . they have a nice collection of beer and the place was clean . i 'll revisit this place .	383
1	i 've shopped around several vape places since i started vaping , but this shop is by far the best . excellent juices and excellent service . they 've always helped me out in everyway possible and i always walk out a happy customer . being fairly new to vaping , they have helped educate me and of the liquid is n't how you want , they 're always willing to correct it . i love it and hope they never close down .	1747
0	bartender was extremely rude and literally pushed me out the door 5 mins after 2 ..with understanding to people in the service industry as i am one who is i involved i felt extremely disrespected and will never return ..especially after tipping well and being mistreated ..what became of subtlety ?	279
1	i 'm not going to lie , my first experience was not good but i am so glad i gave them a second shot . i did n't like their nachos ( i 'm from texas so i put queso on my nachos , not shredded cheese ) . i came in again for taco tuesday and i must say , these are some of the best tacos i 've had in charlotte . the portions are really good for the price . i come here anywhere from 2-3 a month .	1137
1	our air conditioner went out while we were out of town . when we returned home , it was 98 upstairs . fans on and windows covered did not help significantly . we were pleased when the technician arrived wednesday morning and diagnosed the problem and while he did not have a new fan motor , freddy contacted another doctor cool technician who arrived a little later and fixed everything . we were so grateful for a cool sleep that night .	2776
1	i definitely like these guys . i have bought close to $ 7,000 worth of appliances from them in the last year . they have made some errors in delivery and installation , but when given the chance they have made it right . i bought a floor model of a close out big screen hi def tv . when it arrived , it had a chip in the screen that was n't there at the showroom . they let us return that tv and get the sale price on the new model , costing us a few hundred dollars additional rather than the normal $ 2000 difference between clearance and the standard price . they definitely did right by me .	3784
0	this store is incredibly messy . has bad smell . employees horribly rude . books priced at 12.99 . electronics just thrown on top of each other . other goodwill 's have a much better shopping experience .	1657
0	yikes . ummmm ... this coffee was not great . specifically , i had a latte and it was watery tasting and what flavor it did have was `` marginal at best '' .	362
1	jessica at caesar 's palace salon gave me the most fantastic blowout ever ! my hair looked amazing and stayed for 3 days ! love this salon and i will absolutely be back there next time i 'm in vegas ! it was elegant , professional and so gorgeous inside and everyone was so wonderful and friendly ! loved it !	3300
0	i was in this location this morning and was really disappointed . i waited five min before anyone acknowledged me and helped me and they did n't have caramel . i typically go here because not only do i love their coffee , i never have to wait long in line and have a good experience with the employees . today was definitely not the case . wo n't be coming back to this location again .	606
1	great customer service and employees who really care . i highly recommend this firm ! the years of experience they have and the sincere compassion they offer is really wonderful .	2261
1	we found a groupon for a great price for the 3d/4d ultrasound . we only had to wait 5 minutes in the waiting room , the technician was amazing , she was very patient trying to get nice pictures of my stubborn baby that did n't want to show her face . it was a great experience ! ! !	3313
0	overpriced ! they quoted me $ 179 to fix my iphone 6 shattered screen and they did n't even have the white face in stock . the guy then proceeded to tell me that the screen is very expensive and my cost is barely covering their cost to fix it . this is a complete lie ! i do not recommend wasting your time . it 's cheaper to go directly to apple to fix for $ 100 .	3817
1	had an amazing dinner experience last week with them ! our friends were impressed with their steaks so we decided to go check it out . it took us around 30 min from downtown to to get there . we did n't make a reservation , but they gave us one of the best tables available on friday night . menu has a nice variety of meets , fish , salads , desserts . we ordered two dry aged steaks which were amazing ! the meat was so tender and medium rare was cooked to perfection ! as well , cocktails were well done ! this is a must spot to visit for all meat lovers !	1368
1	the good was terrific ! no fancy sign or decor , but the food was delicious , especially the red curry chicken ! !	1501
0	the worst service ever ! ! their technician came change the parts for my fridge and in ten minute he was out without even checking if the problem is solved , i called their customer service to complain she refused to send their technician again to check the same issue and she was so rude and hang up on me , they charge me flat fee for a 10 min job excluding parts , and the fridge is still freezes i called their customer services 4 times to complain and they are totally unprofessional expensive and rude	1208
1	really enjoyed this place . good drinks , nice staff . liked the music . not cheap but welcome to vegas ... .	2513
0	everything are over $ 20 , not worth it at all , my girlfriend were so disappointed by the food they offered . worst spicy pork bone soup ever . and the bogo go is also really bad and it 's 17 dollars ! ! !	688
0	i contacted north shore customer service to see if the why evo remotes offered on their website are compatible with my garage doors . customer service told me they were , so i ordered two , only to find out when i tried to program them that they were not compatible . when i finally received a refund , despite showing them the initial correspondence , north shore only refunded me the price of the remotes , not the full price including shipping . obviously , had i know the remotes would n't work , i would n't have ordered them in the first place .	3470
1	wow , ca n't believe someone gave this store such a terrible review . the hole in their bag of dog food was obviously an accident and not intentional . i have been purchasing from choice pet now for years and find their staff to be friendly and knowledgeable . as for the prices . if you feel they are too high , do n't shop there ! i give them a thumbs up for their courtesy to us and our dog whenever we come in !	1775
0	it 's painful enough getting the service done . i 'm not usually so critical but you 're already on display through the windows and then to speak in your native tongue in an animated way after you begin a service ( on a different area ) is in my opinion rude . i was from out of town and do n't go here regularly but will never return .	2062
0	had a better time previously . they were out of almost everything from food to pies . the server took our straws because we did not use them fast enough . server commented about having to work extra hours . not the greatest time on father 's day	1029
0	did n't really like the soy latte ... also noticed it was way too expensive ... . you call yourselves the brockton haunt ... but you need to earn that title and not just name yourself that ... much prefer the common ... .	268
1	what a stark difference in treatment between this hotel and the hgi i stayed at in irving tx this week . these fine folks know how to treat a customer . very nice . hotel is unique and a little different and this was nice as well .	3503
1	i love this place ! truffle pizza , lobstar mac and cheese , and duck tacos . the three things needed after a long day of work . sign me up anytime and everytime ... . : )	1116
0	place is big and nice..hair stylist is kinda ok but make up stylist didnt do much on make up just a little bit of this and that ... customer service is very poor when we book for appointment didnt explain much about the take home make up thing which we ended up paying $ 30 more.even told us to bring our own stuff like brush set etc ... will not come here again !	2509
1	such a great variety of food for those who are have allergies or other dietary restrictions . although we had a bit of a wait , everyone in our group had a substantial number of meals to pick , and enjoyed what they decided to get . plus , the wait staff keep the coffee coming ! can not wait to return .	975
1	i have used rv phx multiple times . great variety of trailers to choose from . easy and convenient pick up and drop off . i will continue to use them every time i rent a trailer !	1334
0	very bad location & no prove at all & they have bad attitude & very rude & very hard to get schedule . do n't go to this location not worth it all not recommend	343
0	came to buy a bedroom set and noticed that they did not have their flags at half-staff for memorial day . i politely informed the manager about the situation to which they responded `` i do n't have time for that . '' since you , as a company do n't have 30 seconds to lower your flag to honor all those who gave their life for our very freedom i do n't have time to shop in your store !	439
0	i would love to be able to give them a better rating , however after several visits in the last month the inconsistency and the poor service and the workers who are not knowledgeable in proper customer service , i have to say that the only reason i return is my family 's love of the actual bagels -- that is if they have n't run out before 10 am on any given day ! if you want or expect the best deal make sure to ask questions because they will not offer the best deal to you .	477
1	bomb diggity fried chicken ! crispy and flavourful . small cafe like joint in a run down plaza . bubble tea was terrible . would n't recommend the popcorn chicken unless you want to be mistaken for having halitosis .	566
1	good food . ordered the pub burger and added jalapenos and onions . the server christina was real attentive . would recommend	717
1	even though the pima location is still my favorite . i had a great time here , too . after playing in the park with the twins , it was an easy decision to just go across the street and have an early lunch . my kids love the meatballs , and i liked my turkey ruben very much . i still wish they would have the long booths as they do at the pima location .	1387
1	good food , hot , and on time . this is all what we need good job paramount . servers were very efficient and fast .	39
0	place was fast and friendly when i ordered my burrito . the only thing that really had me mad was when i told a cashier that there was no more ice in the machine . she brought it out with full of ice but did not pour it in where it was supposed top go . like what the hell was that am i supposed to do it . i ended up putting my hand in the bucket and got ice for myself this was on june 16 2013 around 8pm . smh lazy people .	214
0	went in to have service done on my a/c . just needed a recharge . been taking both of my cars here for 5 years . did n't see regular crew around so had to talk to a guy i had n't seen before . some pos with gauges in his ears decide to be argumentative with me . wanted to correct everything i said . i 'm 59 years old and do n't need some pos talking down to me . got my key back from him and left . that 's the end of me dealing with pep boys . if they ca n't treat their loyal customers better than that , then i 'll take my cars to firestone ...	959
1	these are probably the best cookies i 've ever had . we 've ordered 3 times already , and the cookies are always warm and melty when they 're delivered . our very first delivery , they put a bow on our box . the confetty wap cookies are best !	1522
0	went by today at 7:20pm and they were closed ! says they 're open until 9pm but nope ! : (	284

1	i can not say enough good things about things about this place ( and i have been to a few ) . i can honestly say that i have continued to stay clean and sober since i was last here . this is an excellent program for those seeking help with recovery . they are doing something special here . they a first class gym with an awesome boxing ring ! incrediblely motivating 12 step meetings ... .the best ever ! i liked the staff that really care . they have a lot of other unique extras such as a nice store , a beauty salon , and a great music therapist ... but still ... this really all about recovery and they do it right !	2493
1	love this eye glass boutique ! owners dan & ouida are awesome people ! good customer service is alive & well here ! sassy glasses has a customer for life in me !	3501
1	i absolutely loved this place ! i ordered the tallerines verde and it turned out exactly like the pictures . the meat was tender and the pasta was perfectly cooked . i would definitely come here again to try other dishes . the service was also great , there was a young guy working the place and his spirit was so lively ! such a pleasant experience for my first time trying peruvian food .	927
1	we went in on a thursday evening around 7pm ... only a few tables taken but alot of activity with take out . the place is very comfortable and welcoming and the reno job is great.. the service was great . we specifically went to sample the pizza and have a couple of beers . the flavors were tasty ... tried the margherita ( had to ! ! ) and one of the specials of the day ... very good and better that its just a short walk away . would like to see a couple of more items on the menu ... ..	257
0	second time here in a week , they so ok car washes . but sick and tired of the harassment of the window repair guy whwn you first drive up . it 's like damn what part of no thanks do n't you get . thinking about not coming back just of the sales harassment .	3250
1	excellent alteration work , the tailor alberto and his wife are very sweet , prices are great ! alberto is the last good tailor in pittsburgh ! !	2858

1	the is the heart of shopping central in north mississauga right where a lot of the big box stores are located . you name the retailer , they are pretty much all represented here with large spacious stores . costco , check ! canadian tire , check ! walmart , check ! home depot , check ! heart sushi , check ! best buy , check ! winners , marshalls , check , check ! ! you could spend a whole day driving around from store to store to indulge in non stop shopping and then spend the evening in one of the many restaurants in the area ! yes i am addicted to the heartland area ... .	318
1	just bought a sectional from ashely 's . the salesperson christian was very helpful , and they text me to keep me up to date on my furniture .	1794
1	the rooms are huge and pretty good . i took a star off bc i came to the pool right when it opened hoping to get some early morning sun , but the entire area is fully shaded i called front desk to ask when i should expect to see sun and the lady had no idea . super bummed out .	2973
1	this is a very clean facility . the management is friendly and helpful , and the rates are reasonable . we got a better rate by signing up online -- and when we needed to make a change , the management was very helpful and did that for us . we only needed the storage for a short time , and the process of discontinuing with them was easy and fast . i highly recommend this public storage facility .	3288
0	worst place ever ! anna is so rude .. not friendly at all super moody . has no manners what so ever ! i will never recommend this place to anyone ! please save your money and do n't go deal with moody people !	3333
0	our car was dirty , smelled like cigarettes , the gas was only half full , and car made whinning noises while driving and steering wheel shook at high speeds . the car was new so did not have license plates and from where we live this is illegal . made pay to parks impossible to use . was a quick and easy return of car . the shuttle driver , donny , was the best part of the rental company . he was super friendly and helpful . he is the only reason i gave one star .	3576
0	we went there with 2 other family , the food were nice , the surprise when the bill came he charged a flat charge of 30 $ per person and this is n't a open buffet but more like a set menu of arabic mezza and grills not only this they charged all children above 6 yrs full price ! ! ! ! ! . cut a story short it is a rip off never will go back there . do n't recommend at all	1235
1	dr. myerthall is fantastic ! i chose him after interviewing three other surgeons to perform a total hip replacement . he is a real person a very nice man . has a solid education and great reputation . my surgery was more complicated because i stalled and suffered for two years . all the while depositing more arthritis and scar for him to cut through . surgery was 16 hours ago . i feel great . i 'm walking and it feels much better than before surgery . dr. myerthall is very skilled and i highly recommend him . also i might add i 'm a veterinary orthopedic surgeon .	2896
1	a fantastic local supply store for explorers and outdoor adventurers . the extent of their offerings is immense and impressive as this is the companies only location . since the main content is all about presenting an unparalleled quality , the prices are unsurprisingly high . however , they do provide a great selection of surplus gear in the back that is sure to keep the more frugal shopper busy . if you 're in the area and need some gear for an outdoor outing , check this place out !	2259
0	i went for an oil change the other day and dealt with a guy named chris he was gross they dont practice hygiene ! ! ! ! and the whole while this creep is trying to flirt with me ! ! ! gross ! ! not to mention they totally ripped me off ! ! dont visit this pep boys ! !	1778

1	saw the reviews and knew the wife and i would love it or hate it . our experience was great . this is a real massage and not a romantic setting so if want that go some place else . they wanted to please and kept asking if we were ok. we went on a monday at 4 so perhaps they were n't overly busy but i know there was another couple and a single who were there at the same time and each group had their own room .	2320
0	candy side was amazing . however the ice cream soda shoppe had the absolute worst customer service . after speaking to a person behind the counter about being seated and telling us there was a hostess `` somewhere '' and being completely ignored by the other 3 people behind the counter i asked one of them if he was the manager . he said he was and i asked why it was taking over 10 minutes to be seated or even acknowledged . he said well we are trying to set up for a party of 25 ... [ you only have a party of 5 ] . we left . fyi i bet we would have tipped better than that party of 25 kids ...	2418
0	i 'm giving only one star because of the service . food and beer was great but the server molly was not good at all . not attentive at all , walking away before all questions were answered , not checking in on how we were doing , etc.. we took initial orders at 2:57 and she gave us a nasty look because we asked for the happy hour prices which are from 3-6 . maybe this was a one off thing but my first experience here was n't pleasant .	630
0	i sent a friend to this store to see an item that i knew would have been perfect in her home , and she was rudely hassled about her stroller by one of the sales staff . in the past , they had been kind to my own family when my potty training child asked to use the bathroom , so i was dismayed to hear how rude they could be to another mother . i bought lovely old chairs and other small items without incident some time ago . then i noticed that they advertise and sell offensive black americana , which caused me to stop shopping there .	1842
0	worst service i 've ever had at a restaurant- hands down . took us 20 mins to get waters and we asked three different servers ( including the bar tender ) . ordered a wrap without tomatoes , and it came with tomatoes . did n't even get enough silverware for my party of three . wo n't be coming back	393
0	the pharmacist is a moron ! ! ! ! seriously a monkey could do a better job ! ! ! they have no clue what thy are talking about and horrible customer service	2287
1	i absolutely love dr sheth ! he does n't rush you during your visit , but rather makes sure you are able to share all concerns and then he makes sure you understand his diagnosis and treatment . he is very thorough and you can tell he genuinely cares for his patients . i have recommended him to everyone i know . thanks dr sheth ! donna whitty	3349
1	very good food ! solid choice while i was here in town for business . cute little place with limited seating , but you can order full menu at the bar .	1171
1	i stopped at the rebel gas station in boulder city to use the restroom and grab some caffeine . while this is n't a high-end gas station like lenny 's c-store , back in my home town of aberdeen , south dakota , i was pleasantly surprised by the pungent , yet overwhelming urine aroma and quaint decor . the cashier yelling at her register and telling my daughter and i that her manager had given her consent to , `` kill it dead , '' offered an unexpected earthiness to what is usually a superficial transaction . i would love to give them five stars , but i 'm docking one because they do n't carry seven layer dip combos .	2786
1	i have used the biltmore group as my property manager for several years . they 've done a great job , very reliable and responsive . highly recommended .	3723
1	there usually is a wait , but the work is always worth the wait ! they get really creative with their designs , i can come here and ask for just about any design and they do it !	2297
1	i have been coming to this particular dunkin since i moved to vegas 14 years ago . large iced coffee , cream and sugar . they never get it wrong . ugh some places put sooo much cream and leave you with 2 inches of sugar in the bottom of the cup . lol - not these guys . daughter loves the donuts , and of course , chocolate milk . we will keep coming back . wish there was one further down craig road though .	618
1	dr. raymond bunch keeps me coming back . if you are looking for a truly gifted child psychiatrist ... ... ..this is the doctor you want for your child . trust me i have met the gamut around this town . i drive 40 miles one way to see this amazing man . his nurse that takes messages/helps you is also freakin ' fantastic , lahsen .	888
0	dear arnold , i wish you were my employee ... .. so i could fire you . you are the most rude and lazy person i 've came across in las vegas . this location sucks .	1237
0	visiting scottsdale , arizona usa from france in may . came in for fullset because of the 40 % off promotion . polly did a terrible job on my nails . it took her almost 2 hours to finish my nails , yet all my nails lifted and came off in 3 days . i had to deal with ugly nails for the whole trip . very frustrated .	2008
1	there are very few companies i have dealt with in my life that will stand behind their word . although there was miscommunication initially , perfection handyman came by and fulfilled their contract with me . they could not fix the problem only because of a faulty item which was not their fault . however , they came by and did their best and explained the situation . they were very professional , courteous and clearly have many people who have had good work done by them . thus i am retracting my harsh criticism of them since all has been resolved to my satisfaction .	3221
0	we had the three meat platter the mean was very tender but was not what we expected from a great bbq joint .	966
0	i bought the wrong item rushing tried to take it back for an exchange and nope ! i was told all sales are final ! never going again and would n't recommend it to professionals .	1659
0	i used a coupon for a white tips set it was trash . i asked for my cuticles to be pushed back he ignored me and began to bump my nails and put acrylic on my skin my nails are also shorter because he cut them unevenly if he was good i was gon na put an extra ten for tip but now i 'm never going there again putting them on blast on ig running to a different salon now they ruined my nails .	415
0	this hotel should be so much better for a supposed `` elegant four-star hotel . '' noisy heating , small rooms , pebbly-feeling sheets , smelly pillows , tv did n't work , thin walls . i was horribly embarrassed to have booked this hotel for my boss and myself during a business trip to montreal .	1671
0	horrible fucking service ! ! ! ! barbers here will not greet you as you enter the door . they will take there sweet ass time cutting hair and will not acknowledge a customer if they are working on a client . they will literally watch you sit for hours before asking if you need a haircut . i was sitting for 15 mins seen a barber just got done cutting a clients hair , and went straight to his meal . barbers here are divas and feel like you came there for them ! wo n't ever come back to this unprofessional establishment . oh and by the way , i seen them reuse the same razor blade to line people up .	761
1	always fast , always honest . even on an oil change they do n't try and up sell unnecessary repairs . and even thought they are full service they recommended other companies for services they might not be able to complete to expectations . a little pricier than some other places but you get what you pay for .	2262
1	i can not say enough about how great penny is at cottage of flowers . i recently got married and she made my day a dream come true ! she was so thoughtful and committed to keeping us on budget . the day before our wedding she even facetimed me to make sure i loved my bouquet ! she went far beyond any expectation we had . simply , amazing !	1600
1	we went there for winterlicious last week . i liked the place . the service was gast and efficient . the food was good . i had spring rolls , veggie curry and crepes . my only complaint about the food - really not spicy enough . i did not feel the kick at all . i guess next time i go i will ask for more heat in my food . : )	1425
1	celebrated our father 's birthday on saturday , february 18 we were lucky enough to have kristen for our server she was incredible ! the food was absolutely fantastic the coleslaw blue cheese side and loaded potatoes are a must all the meats melted in your mouth . if you have not been here it 's a must enjoy ! tt	1147
0	petsmart would not take my small dog because she had a bandage on her neck while another petsmart had no proble two days before . you would think the company would be consistent . thanks for the inconvenience ! i 'd think twice about leaving your pet at this location .	2649
0	rude as hell ! they do not acknowledge when a customer comes in and when you ask how long the workers never answered ... i read all of the previous comments and the number one complaint is how rude they are . i thought i had finally found a nail shop in vegas that can do nails and be professional but i am back on the hunt again for another nail shop because i refuse to spend my hard earned dollars in this establishment and deal with their rude asses ! as time passes i noticed that the quality of their work decreases !	2929
1	i heard about dr. bikoski since someone referred me to him as best dermatologist in town . i really liked him ! he can be a little rude but he is a good doctor . i can not tell anything about my results since i am still in treatment . he is the kind of doctor that tells you straight what you have and sometimes can get a little rude .	3438
1	i have been a member at lvac for almost 5 years and have visited almost every location . but the north decatur gym is by far the best . friendly staff , state of the art equipment , and everything is always very clean . unfortunately it is one of the higher volume locations , so parking is difficult at certain times . but all around , it is a spectacular gym !	3268
0	i was drawn to the store because of the variety of nba jerseys . i collect them/workout in them as well . i intended on buying multiple jerseys until i realized i was being visually tracked by a store employee . i gave him the benefit of the doubt , but as i shopped i realized i was the only customer being followed around a pretty populated store , and had no choice but to assume i was being racially profiled . i do n't throw this accusation lightly , because i realize its magnitude but the actions of this employee can not be allowed . not only did they lose money that day but i refuse to shop their in the future as well .	871
0	i ca n't comment on the food yet because i have been waiting for at least 20 mins , not even counting the waiting time ( another 10 mins ) . we were standing at the door , i 'm sure the waitresses saw us but not greeting us .	796
0	my daughter ate thete on dec 27th 2017 got severe foid poisoning . she had the salad w chicken , eggs , ect . abdominal pain , 101 temp vomiting . w/in an hr or two eating there . lasted 1 and half days .	1259
0	after wanting to visit earth for a couple of years i was truly disappointed when my boyfriend and i went for summerlicious . the food was subpar and the service was mediocre . i heard recently that they 're closing and i 'm not surprised .	918
0	loved this place but he suddenly went ouf of business . after i paid for a vip subscritpion . sad	2320
0	i stopped by kirk 's before a show at the nile theater . people need to know that this place is attached to a best western hotel and it 's dirty and gross . it was very crowded and they only had two bartenders that were extremely slow . it took us 40 minutes to get two beers . it is , however , one of the only bars on main st that is open on sundays .	130
0	pretty terrible , even with a hangover . i would n't have eaten here unless i was desperate for eggs ... and that 's exactly what happened . it 's a tourist trap restaurant in a busy location with no reason to bring local patrons back . small eggs , overly onioned potatoes , mushy , cheap sausages , the service was rushed ... all sorts of things to keep this place off my breakfast/brunch list . i 'm quite certain i will never ever return .	243
1	been to this place twice and every time i have went the food was got and excellent and the service provided by shakira was absolutely magnificent ! definetly will be back ! ! keep up the great work !	862
1	best indian food in toronto ! highly recommended !	889
1	great gym . it has a ton of strength and cardio equipment . i especially love the group fitness classes , which are free . the only complain i have is the annoying high school kids that think it 's fun to hang out at the gym after school . they just take up space for the rest of us who are serious about working out . also , some of the mats are old and warn out .	1740
0	really slow service , people too busy talking and not enough serving . i had to leave and did n't even order cause they were so slow and unaccommodating	1346
0	i got a detached retina and dr. hollifield operated on my eye the same day it was diagnosed . i was patient number four that he operated on that night . i went into the operation with 20/20 corrected vision and ended up with 20/50 vision ( corrected ) which essentially messed up my vision in that eye for the rest of my life . i felt that followup care was very haphazard . i was then told to go get a cataract operation in that eye yet two other ophthamologists who examined the eye said i did n't need a cataract operation . i 'm very unhappy .	3527
0	i was pretty disappointed . they have a large selection , but not good prices . the barbacide is cheaper at sally 's . i 'd rather go to direct beauty supply . i think it was the owner or manager that helped me . i asked her if they had a clear get on a certain brand and she responded `` what you see is what we have ... '' they are n't very friendly .	1659
0	there are so many other cabinet companies ... do n't waste your time or money here as customer sat is not a priority for them !	1085
0	would n't let me take a test ride on a $ 600 bike because i did n't have a credit card . i offered to leave my iphone and passport with them while i rode , but they were pigheaded about policy . i mean really , i 'm going to steal a bike when you have my passport and iphone and can easily have the police track me down ? i will never shop here again . stupid people ...	1624
0	this place is for suckers . they put pictures of cars online that they do n't really have . that really really irks me . we had a salesman before we even got out of our car . he immediately started lying through his teeth . this place is a joke . i have no idea where they get their prices from . jacked up thousands of dollars . i highly do not recommend .	3305
0	my kids are no longer at the age where i need to use the daycare so it seems the magic has worn off here ... outdated equipment , bogus fees each year , not the cleanest anymore , and i cancelled . i wish there was a nice clean gym with good classes in surprise	2699
0	it 's 96 degrees today may 30th , memorial day weekend . we thought to spend a nice picnic day at this park and enjoy the water feature of this park , but when we got here the water is not working . i do n't understand why ? , there is no signs with any kind of explanatio . weekends like today should be the peak weekends for this parks . my whole family was very disappointed , this is why i only give this park 1 star . typical city/government workers mentality , not proactive at all .	3808
1	went in today for a thermalo with maria , the owner , and she rocks ! super friendly , super attentive , appropriate etiquette ( as i had to undress a little more ) , and of course extremely knowledgeable ! she was training two other women on thermalo , great teacher too ! totally recommend senza pelo med spa ! i 've gone in for other services in the past as well ; april-electrolysis , and kiara-blow out , always a pleasant experience . now i see where everyone gets it from , their leader maria !	3366
0	took my car in as it needed its scheduled maintenance . they called me and gave me an estimate of over $ 4,000 ? ? ? seriously ? i told them i wanted a second opinion . i took my car to 2 other mechanics and neither of them quoted me over $ 1,000 . i do not think they are honest and i definitely do not recommend them ! on top of it , they were rude to me when i told them not to perform the work , even though i paid almost $ 100 just to look at it !	1067
0	went downhill when all the regular guys left , new girl seems forced to fake it 1/2 the time , i 've avoided coming here for the past few years but idk if it 's worth taking the extra 20 minute drive to go to a store where i know they are not just talking out of their you know what ...	2687
1	this was my first time here and was worth it found 2 pair of nike shorts for 16.37 dollars that not a bad deal i will be coming back and i recommend it to anyone who looking for cheap clothes	1446
0	dirty place ... .average donuts average donuts dirty tables , dirty floor and he customer who opened a new creamer container with their mouth ... .bleh ... . wo n't return	3322
0	very slow service . not sure about the prices - more than seattle certainly . employees were nice but the way they place orders just takes soooo long . they were steady but not super busy so i would have expected quicker service . the floor space is huge but mostly open space and shirts/merch . no custom/unique glass . not a super crazy selection which surprised me considering the size of the location ... did have a good variety of edibles/tinctures/salves/etc . they messed up our order and waiting for them to fix it also took ages : / tl ; dr i would n't recommend this place or go there again - the large floor space is basically the whole gimmick .	1025
1	we rented an intermediate size car - we drove away in a car that i would n't consider intermediate - i thought it was a compact . i called back to sebastian , who told me to come back and they would find another car . no intermediate cars available , so he upgraded us to an suv , at no additional cost ! not only that , he transferred my groceries from one car to another . i could not be happier with sebastian 's customer service skills and will certainly go back to enterprise ( mostly because of sebastian ) !	2371
0	just go to apple to get your screen fixed . it 's the same price and this place fixed my iphone glass at the cost of creating internal damage that apple verified was from improper screen replacement . when i went back to this place with my receipt and all , they refused to refund me and said it was already like that which it was n't . again ... .apple is the exact same price minus the tempered glass addition but they actually know what they 're doing so forewarning .	3817
0	worst service i have ever had two visits in a row . service has always been around a 2/3 out if 5 ... the last two times i went i 'd give then a 1 and only because our food actually came out . our waiter was awful . had to track down another server twice for drink refills and our check . rude employees . will not be back to that location !	178
0	i had a number of issues . first they did n't have the king i reserved ? the outlets in the light at the desk did n't work so my computer did n't charge , the alarm did n't work , the tub drained really slow and what really irritated me was the tv in the bedroom did n't work . i found the breakfast to be mediocre .	2296
0	what a pretencious bar full of leather drag queens . 2nd worse bar on church st , after crews/tango . been here 2x and never wish to go again . its a shame there is such a street a nice as church , but not one good gay bar to go to , your better off going to bistro on college and bathurst or cadillac lounge on queen west .	1827
0	very dated , paint chipping and wallpaper peeling everywhere . needs a facelift and makes you worry about how clean everything really is . pull out sofa broken and not useable . breakfast was good and the attendant , laura , was very nice . we usually stay at the hi express chain but this was $ 40 cheaper . you get what you pay for .	3387
1	perfect for one stop shopping . i always get my oil changed here and get extras i need at home while i wait . place has everything so you end up getting more than you need . cashiers are always nice and smiling	2443
1	staff is nice , place is clean , food is yummy . nothing entirely special or stand out about it but delicious none the less .	1116
1	southpark is probably one of the few malls left that still looks new and fresh ! i 've shopped here for years , always find a great selection and bargains , and have never had any issues . i 've always felt safe . the `` strangers project '' on display near dick 's was so incredibly touching as well . some writings broke my heart . the world is definitely a challenging place but my thoughts are with all of you ! thank you southpark for allowing so many to share this experience !	492
1	once again on thursday night after work i take the bus east instead of west and end up at wild wing . the pint and a pound deal ca n't be beat . sitting on the patio watching the world go by . usually have the hot honey flavour and it is awesome . today i was hankering for something different and went with the desperado . yummy it was . now this comes with fries unless you order the deal . if you are in the neighbourhood stop by and enjoy . service is fine .	866
1	my son and i love going to kangamoo ! the staff is wonderful , the environment is clean , and it is so much fun ! we have only been twice , but each time has been a lot of fun . each parent and child is given the same stamp when entering . the stamp is checked before leaving to ensure safety . the staff are very attentive and interact with the kids . there are different activities going on each day for the kids to participate in . they even have healthy snacks available to purchase . this is my favorite place to go with my son during the hot summer months .	1631
1	friendly staff and quick . each table comes with a button to call the server if you need them to come by for water/bill/etc . food comes out fresh and delicious . the portions are fairly large . the ambiance is nice . slightly dimmed lights and nice music playing . not a high end place , but still nice .	89
0	i ordered avocado smoothies it taste like shit worst drink ever ! ! ! yuck never ever come back here again	1898
0	ok place the servers are nice . some of the games were n't functioning properly . we played beer pong for about 40 bucks a pitcher . order a lot more drinks maybe a few hundred dollars worth then when asking for water ... they only sell bottled water for a ... you guessed it , astronomical price . probably wo n't be back unless i bring my own camel bak	2494
0	3 employees ringing concessions up . i have literally counted 12 different employees that are not assisting customers , cleaning or taking tickets . bought tickets to the movie 21 mins ago . still waiting in a line to get popcorn . why have employees if you dont provide customer service . next time i 'll netflix and chill . this is why movie going is becomong part of the past . still waiting to order	491
0	i went in to inquire about my dog 's medical situation and the receptionist did n't smile or greet me . as i was talking , her attitude was horrible and did n't seem to care about my situation . she also said they are booked for the next two weeks and said to call back in a week to see if they will take new clients . very unpleasant and unprofessional ! !	2887
1	the most incredible experience ! barbara is an amazingly talented estician that made me feel so at home . followed by the facial , stacy did my cut and color . she is the best ! do n't hesitate if you can grab an appointment here , you wo n't regret i promise !	2265
0	i was in here one day with a friend letting them look around , and i saw who seemed to be the ( male ) owner of the shop call his employee , in all seriousness , a `` f*cking moron ! '' super unprofessional , made me feel uncomfortable . while skimming through the other reviews , i see that the owner has a reputation .	794
0	i was so excited to see this place open . i used to love it at scottsdale fashion square and was sorry to see it go . so when i saw this new one i was stoked . ehhh not so much . food was mediocre and forgettable . if you want to go french ! go french !	1276
0	got a dog , had to be put down three days later with distemper . thousands of dollars spent and a child 's broken heart . there is no recourse when adopting a dog from this place , they are not responsible for anything . they do n't care for these dogs , they just sell them . i will never adopt from this shelter again .	2689
1	this target store is always clean , has the friendliest staff , and they always have amazing clearance items . i go there so often i know most of the staff lol . the only downfall of this target is the bathrooms are always filthy and there are never toilet covers . someone please scrub them .	1178
0	service was not good at all ! opens at 11 but says the ovens are not ready until 12:30 . what kind of place opens but ca n't make pizza until hour and half later . there are many better places to go to then this .	328
1	tried the dbox seats ! they were pretty cool . it was a fun experience - good location and theatre was clean & friendly	2486
0	after having my first review removed for not enough detail i will provide more information . brother 's tailors did an ok job altering my husbands pants in april . this service was charged a huge fee over what was quoted . brothers tailors may take pride in their work but i think paying $ 65.00 for a simple adjustment is overpriced considering the quote was much lower . also , sticking by a quote is very important . i have my discover card receipt to prove this is a valid review so i will post again if this one is removed .	442
0	wow , lvms 's inclement weather plan for high winds is to move 115,000 people from the electric daisy carnival up into the grandstand so they can be exposed to even more wind ? i understand the need to prevent another indiana state fair disaster but this shows a complete failure on the part of lvms and insomniac to plan for this . poorly handled , pathetically managed once again . lvms finds new ways to give las vegas a black eye when it comes to managing large events . in short this is what constitutes an epic fail .	2955
0	had the matcha maiko special with red beans and cereal and jelly . first time having this dessert , having never tried matcha before and having no idea what it is . but after having it , its a bit stronger and tastier than the green tea ice cream but i dont think matcha dessert is really for me . its not bad or anything . ice cream cant be bad . but just nothing to rave home about . the difference between green tea ice cream and matcha isnt that much and i like red beans already and the cereal .	2984
0	i 'm a huge fan of paradise bakery , but this was my first experience at panera . terrible . service is slow , staff is obviously undertrained , the restaurant is unorganized and does n't flow , the food was mediocre , my fork was dirty ( and you have to ask the staff for another one , as they do not place them out for customers ) , and the espresso machine was down . i wo n't be going back , at least to this location .	148
0	so , here is my delimma , spoke to jeremy when i walked in and greeted me not in a firendly way . i asked to get a navigation to be inputed in my civic and he did not seem to know what i was talking about . anyways at the end , it was n't a good first expression and this is why i left with a quote . i would have happily paid for a navigation with the quote . but it was the way he acted maybe it was a bad day he had i do n't know . i wish i could have given this shop a chance and refer to my family but now i will take my service somewhere else .	419
1	love this place ! i go here for lunch a lot as my office is right down the street . their perch sandwich is outstanding . the perch comes with melted cheese on it with outstanding tartar sauce on the side . the fries are amazing as well . the staff here is very friendly , attentive and fun to chat with .	1080
1	from start to finish with the purchase of our suv was absolutely amazing . they are very professional and will make this purchase as easy as possible for you . will spencer is our man and guy that we trust . thank you again ! !	2851
0	in a recent klas tv and their website , one of their journalists , caroline bleakley , wrote a story which had the title : `` man arrested in connection with body found in cement . '' ms. bleakley should be forced to go back to school and learn the english language . the word `` cement '' is a form which is a liquid/viscous state . what she should have written is : `` concrete '' which is a solid state . shame on channel 8 , specifically their editors . unprofessional which , to me , they lose credibility .	1870
1	i orderedtaiwanese sticky rice , crispy spicy squid , takoyaki and icy formosa bowl . it all tastes so delicious ! !	344
0	just got a note two weeks after our drop-in at black lotus from 'tyler ' telling me that black lotus does n't do piercings . . really ? ! that must be why we were shown all the jewelry available and introduced to the piercer ( on his way to the bathroom ) . why lie ? if i could give a negative rating for this business , i would !	2621
0	no more lunch buffet though the equipment is still there . new chairs and tablecloths . maybe new owners ? the lunch specials were similar to mall chinese food other than a huge serving of rice and a very good hot and sour soup . too bad .	568
1	top notch care ! shout out to dr. comeh and dr. segreti you two women are rocks stars in my eyes and i want to thank west penn for getting my mom all fixed up brand new . she went in for major surgery on 01/16 and was released 3 days later . the hospital is kept extremely clean and well managed and her surgery went like clock work .	3214
1	the food here is so good ! i ordered char kway teow , satays and chicken curry . truly malaysian food with great flavours ! i 've been there twice and will definitely order from them again .	1425
1	ashley is the bestest . they 'll let you act like an asshole on the reg of you tip them well	2718
1	happy atmosphere with lots of good quotes . all day breakfast draws my attention and the container bar is right next to the high ground . iced cappuccino and cranberry lemonade are good . we ordered bagel toast and tuscan sunrise ( with eggs and sausage ) abt 18bucks all together . a lot ppl came to study , work or chat .	2163
1	so far i 've been on here twice . each time the lady ( i think the owner ? ) has been the one to take our order . service is excellent and the crepes are delicious ! i have only had the dessert type crepe here . i would like to try the other items on their menu . i will definitely be back to try them .	762
0	i found this restaurant a very unwelcoming place . the employees were not at all friendly . they did not care about their customers . it was hot and uncomfortable inside . they advertise three types of ice tea availble , and there was none . the soda machine was not working properly and the employees could care-less about it . the food was relatively good , but nothing special . i would not come here again due to the rude and aloof attitude of the employees .	875
0	went for winterlicious - and this is what i summed up from my experience there : food - small quantities , good presentation , overpriced , lacked pizzazz . service - host very friendly , server not so friendly and had memory loss . ambience - very nice , well furnished and good mood lighting .	753
0	i live in scottsdale but stopped in this tempe location this week ( was next door at whole foods ) . never heard of pet planet before so i wanted to check it out . the girl working halley told me they were locally owned , they are not ( just looked it up they are canadian owned ) ! she also acted like i was an idiot and knew nothing about dog care . left irritated , worst brief experience at a pet store .	2999
1	my dryer broke and the sears appliance guy was n't going to be able to get out to the house for a week . i decided i would try to repair it myself . a quick look on youtube and after starting the dryer and seeing there was no glow coming from the dryer igniter i thought it must be bad . i took it down to apc , just one look and eddie confirmed that my igniter was in fact bad . they had the part , a 15 min install and my dryer was up and running . i saved the time and expense of paying the appliance technician . great service ! thanks again eddie !	3242
1	never ever fails to disappoint for the best mexican food in the valley . it 's been open for many years , it 's family owned , and the quality is great . i always skip the bar after my youthful failed frozen margaritas and just go for the combos on the huge menu . their enchiladas are excellent and the owner is so nice !	1346
0	the lobby was ok , we had to wait a while for them to clean the theater , which was ok i guess , but there were too many people there which led to a lot of getting up , moving etc . there were these really bright lights in your eyes the whole coming attractions ( and poor sound ) but when the credits rolled , you couldnt see where you were stepping down the stairs at all . the screen was smaller too . i would much rather go to sunset way better .	491
0	went here because of the good reviews . i just bought a couple batteries and the reason i 'm giving this low score is because the batteries were dead when i purchased them . any time i 've bought batteries from any other place they were fully charged . the girl i spoke to was very friendly though.. i do n't want to take that away from the place . she was a blonde girl and i did n't catch her name , but she was very friendly . the place is very clean and neat and i liked that . if i try them again i will adjust this rating .	2839
0	they by far the worst pharmacy i 've been to . i come at 12:02 and was told come back in 20 mins and your prescription will be ready . it 's now 1:24 and was told they did n't even put it in the computer nor was it filled and it 's going to be another 20 mins . smh . now ima be late picking up my son	758
0	unfortunately , this restaurant has gone downhill over the last 20 years . the food is still great , but the overall experience is disappointing . no wonder why it 's pretty empty on our visits !	1558
1	ca n't begin to express my gratitude towards kathy wilhelmy flowers . when one of the national chains failed me and did n't deliver my flowers on time with 4 days notice , the kind folks here saved the day on 1 hour notice and did n't even flinch . they 've gained a customer for life .	1132
1	the layout and lighting of this store is more open and brighter than some of the other smith 's and grocery stores in general throughout vegas . their prices are better than the couple other grocers in our area , which offers a very limited selection for grocery purchases . this location 's staff is pretty friendly and helpful when we have questions or ca n't find something . their deli has a habit of advertising food specials , then never having the food available . the ads work so well i start craving the food pictured , run over to buy it only to be told , `` we do n't have that '' .	1223
0	1 star is too many . went to the vig to actually get some service and recover from the rudest staff and ownership we 've ever experienced anywhere .	1707
1	i used to go to somewhere close by but was n't impressed anymore . read the reviews on this place and decided to try . i will definitely go back . they were helpful , courteous and very good . i did the green tea pedi and it was worth every of the $ 45-50 . very clean , thorough , cleansing and relaxing . the shoulder massage while my toes dried nearly made me fall asleep it felt so good . i recommend this place highly .	2148
1	the orange cow on the patio is a great indicator where this place is and making it hard to miss . we just grabbed a couple of beers on the patio . beers will be beers ... but love their patio ! it 's facing a pretty big street - however - the fact that there are a few trees/bushes kind of secluding the patio , makes it for a very nice place to enjoy your drink . it did n't seem overly busy , and was fairly easy to get a spot indoor or on the patio .	3147
0	called to get some info let the phone ring for almost 5 minutes no pick up what kind of super store is this	2443
0	terrible service ! i wish i could say something about the food , but we never got to try it . after waiting 20 minutes for service and watching the waiter attend to the 3 tables that were seated after us , we finally gave up and left . we will not be returning !	192
1	love this place ! i 've had the shrimp rundown and it 's presented beautifully ! red pea soup is amazing and the ox tail is my favorite ! staff is always super sweet and attentive when i come in .	1325
0	pedicure was awesome ! i got the coconut milk pedi and had no complaints . however , i was given a mediocre manicure . my gel nails were not cleaned properly and they stuck to my fingers . today is two days later and my gel manicure has already started to lift . disappointing experience .	838
0	typical dealership . they know the car well ( i should hope so ) but every repair is extremely expensive . you can usually do better to go to a local mechanic . we needed a new antenna for our jetta ... $ 50 . yeah , no thanks , i bought one on ebay for $ 11 . they do have loaners which is nice , and a nice little waiting room area with free coffee and wifi , but the location is bad ( way far out in middleton , not near any public transport ) and the prices are just absurd .	3774
0	approximately 40 a month . adequate equipment . slightly crowded - not a big deal after all this is scarborough . minor annoyance - always hip hop music . not all of us enjoy hip hop music . major problem - this gym is not properly maintained . the metal cable holding the pins are always exposed - i cut my hand two times so far . not hygienic . loose pieces everywhere . it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously injured and they face a law suit . otherwise it would be a 4 stars easy .	1552
1	amazing as always ! ! ! missed this place since leaving ny and best part i walk in and the banner has a ny giants cake ! ! !	1201
1	my fiance and i had the pedi-colada . it was great ! my fiance loved it ; he found it very relaxing and when his pedicurist ( ? ) was done , he felt as if he was walking on air . jackie r was hilarious and very fun . i did n't get a chance to check out the amenities , but i think my fiance said the facilities were pretty nice . it 's obviously more than i would pay for a regular pedicure but it 's vegas !	2317
1	i love their balsamic chicken salad ! i 've always had great service and when i have guests from out of town i always bring them to sammy 's !	1116
0	i will never go there again ! it was $ 80 for a mani/pedi and the service was n't great ! did have wifi from local shops so i could get some work done .	3213
1	it was very nice and the location is excellent ! ! .. you can access eaton center easily ! . and go anywhere in downtown just walking ! ! .. the parking is not cheap . but it is downtown toronto , just for that , it is expensive . the view from the room is incredible ! ! .. for me it was really beautiful ! ! .. even when is not a new hotel , i think the rooms are very well maintained . and the service is very good . i would recommend this hotel , just for the gorgeous view of toronto ! ! ...	1690
1	it is a little pricey , but love this place ! very good pastries , cakes , etc . it is a grocery store , but it has its nice ambiance .	1160
1	chinese delivery that actual tastes good ! the egg rolls are sooo good not your typical basic bland food . i got vegetable fried rice and beef with broccoli . a lot of vegetables and good flavor ! the beef with broccoli was so tender and the sauce was delicious . so glad i found this place	1575
0	target does n't understand what plant based meals means ! lol . finally found what i was looking for three freezers down , not labeled .	3259
1	the ambience is great ! perfect for a date night , they have a full bar and the food is amazing ! seriously , i think this is my favorite indian restaurant of all times . i just got done eating and i think i want to eat some more , its that good . there was also a bellydancer that was amazing and super friendly . they apparently have dancers every friday and saturday , perfect for a girls night or just something different to do .	1497
1	stayed here for one night when i had an early flight the next morning . check in was fast and the front desk agent was friendly and answered all my questions . the room was clean and the bed comfortable . breakfast the next morning was good . one of the reasons i chose this hotel was the park and fly option they offer . i was able to leave my car there for 4 days for only $ 50 , much cheaper than leaving it at the airport . also , they offer a free shuttle to and from the airport ! i would stay again .	3248
0	they finally responded to my post . i contacted them by email and gave them my contact information . they have yet to contact me . do n't let their response to the poor reviews fool you . they do n't care about you and your family 's safety . they do n't correct their mistakes .	3860
1	cute place and a great atmosphere ! i got an iced rolo ( a mocha with caramel ) . it was super tasty . the employee that helped us was very friendly . definitely will be back !	407
1	delicious food . they have mutton biryani on weekends , it is very good and affordable .	1540
1	we live in northern california and just bought a fifth wheel from them . we have had great service and the most friendly courteous people that have bent over backwards to help us .	3453
1	i had an mri there and they were extremely nice , accommodating and understanding of my need to be comfortable since i was in a lot of pain and a wheelchair . both the patient care and mri technician were very thorough on why i was having it done and what we were looking for/ruling out . they made sure i was comfortable the entire time from start to finish . i would go back there anytime and feel like i was in good hands . i even got a copy of the cd as i was leaving . thanks everyone !	3093
0	we are regulars at the sushi but i was a bit disappointed with the service last night . we had to ask for a menu because they forgot and it took about 30 minutes before we got any food . the food was great quality is always but i just did n't feel like a valued customer	408
0	i was a long time member . unfortunately things have gone downhill . after the 3rd incident involving service blunders , i will never go back .	2300
1	i took my dog here twice for life threatening medical situation . first time , she had anemia and the second time she had heart failure . dr. hechko and his staffs are just wonderful . they got me an appointment on the same day i called . he correctly diagnose the symptom right away on both time and gave her the right medication . he saved our dog twice . he is very patient and spent a lot of time answering all my questions . i think his charges are reasonable .	2770
1	had a `` veggie wrap '' - whole wheat wrap with all the veggies and pesto . this is a fantastic vegetarian / vegan option ! for $ 4.99 + tax i received a super tasty and very filling wrap !	447
1	one of the best wing restaurants in town . meaty chicken cooked well . lots of flavors and dipping sauces . gr8 cole slaw , thick sliced fresh veggies and texas toast done right . prices and service are superior . gr8 for leftovers so order extra . has everything but hooter girls .	1397
1	yet again the sands does cowboy christmas right . great people and wonderful gifts for friends and family ! love the bulls	587
1	we just found this place while heading out to shop at the eaton ` s centre-and what a great place ! ! the ladies were fabulous , the dresses sooo cute-everything my 16 yr old tried on fit and looked amazing ! will definately be back ! !	1594
0	one of the worst place to live ! ! ! i wo n't be listing the issues because there 's too many on the list ! do yourself a favor your better off living in a trailer i 'll just leave it there ! ! ! save yourself a big freaking headache with this place trust me . or check this place out for yourself if you do n't believe me..	1828
1	i ca n't say enough good things about this place . the food combos are nigh infinite and you get to do everything to your own taste . great place to eat . and it is way more food than what it looks like .	209
1	erika met me at the front desk and she was very very very very nice . i am very excited to start this program because i have been trying to lose weight so long and so many of my friends have lost weight here .	297
0	this place is mainly a bar . the bar is located in the middle and is very large . tables around it . the food is good but very expensive . probably not coming back .	1331
0	used to love this place but i 'm here now and all it is is anything but country ... . last time i came with my wife for a rare night out it was the same thing so we left . going downhill quick	2554
0	michelle made it to 4 of the 6 appointments i scheduled with her . i received email confirmations for all . after the first time she was a no-show , she had a decent excuse so i figured i 'd give her another try . she made it to the next appointment we set up , but then she failed to show up for the following one . the facials ( imo ) were pretty good and she has products that are effective but that just does n't add up to very many stars if she is n't reliable .	750
1	it has a good atmosphere and good beer selection if the beers you like are german or belgian . although i have n't personally eaten here there is a good and varied good menu . plenty of seatig that can accomodate larger groups and large open garage style window that gives that patio feel in thw summer time . i would definitely come here more often if it were closer to the east side !	3344
0	the rooms were okay for what they were . the complimentary breakfast was a joke . the lines were ridiculous and some `` crowd control '' was definitely needed in my opinion . the restaurant ( rocky river grille ) was horrible . service was slow and food was very bland . i would not stay here again . it is not worth the price .	2101
1	love this restaurant . favourite thai food . love the queensway establishment if still there . price is reasonable too .	1362
1	chicken was a bit dry and the potatoes are n't pealed but the dessert was big and delicious ! our waitress mallory ( sp ? ) was excellent , she checked in on us throughout the evening and even went the extra mile at the end of dinner service when she ran up the escalator to return my friend 's phone to her .	534
0	store was nice . little cramped making it uncomfortable but pretty clean and tons to choose from . however , the service was disappointing . i walked thru the store for about 15 minutes , no one even asked me if i needed help , and when i finally asked one girl she said she was already helping someone else and did n't offer to find me anyone else . i went in looking for all new makeup . from foundation to mascara ... i need everything and with all the choices and brands it 's very overwhelming . i could n't get anyone to help me , so i guess i 'll have to try some place else . any suggestions anyone ?	2574
0	the food definitely does n't taste traditional , the sinigang tastes like straight up fat , like the meat was n't washed thoroughly and is very watered down . the kare kare tasted cheap . overall , i was n't satisfied . it 's my first and last time coming here . good luck . lol .	658
0	money in pocket to spend . not even a hello in an uncrowded but nice looking store with what looked like a good inventory . looks like i 'm going to bass	1561
0	absolutely disheartening ! i 've been trying to relocate to arizona . today is april 19 , 2018 . since march 28 , 2018 , no one from this office has responded to my online requests to view properties through them . also , no one from this office has returned any of my phone calls . smh , i guess they do n't need the business .	1805
0	i 'm so disappointed i 've never used 1800flowers before . i picked out my bouquet , ordered the medium size asked for same day delivery and at the time of order it said i missed the deadline for same day delivery , ok fine . then the flowers arrive at 6pm , which is pretty late for a delivery . ok fine . but the flowers arrived in a tiny case overly shoved with flowers that are not even close to what i ordered ! ! i 'm so disappointed and would not use them again !	38
1	the service is great the staff are wonderful food was 100 % enjoyable , my family will always makes this one of or stops when in las vegas .	1071
1	great display of all the games at the theater place..but seats are theater seats ... so not so comfortable by the time you get home.. esp after sitting in them 3 days in a row for mm . great price for beers , dogs and good use of tellers at the machines to get all our bets and 1/2 time bets in too keep the lines moving ... better that the past 3 years..bravo hilton bravo ! ! !	2271
0	i 've been coming here on and off for over 5 years . medical staff is fine , but the office staff is horrid . referrals take 1-2 months to process , after you come in to the office requesting them a 3rd and 4th time ... this has happened to my self and husband ... today , the front person forgot to check me in , after waiting an hour and a half ... i will try their scottsdale location for one last shot ...	2303
1	great spot at the arboretum for a date night or dinner with friends . low lights and cozy booths make it a comfortable atmosphere . wine selection is good but the specialty cocktails are tasty . the steaks are perfectly cooked and can be cut with a spoon . i recommend the wedge salad which can be split , any size filet and the charleston statue shrimp and grits .	1147
0	i went to purchase a piece of furniture that was on a `` black friday sale '' . funny thing is i had taken a picture of it a few months back and it was the same price , not on sale . this place runs line a car dealership . the salesman has to go back to his manager to wheel and deal . it 's a scam . and the quality is very poor . had to return some furniture i bought months back a few times because it kept falling apart . i 'd shop else where .	439
1	i ca n't believe how good this place is . if you are looking for an ehrnfelt recreation center in strongsville , this is the place for you .	1620
0	truly a 1 star establishment . i love a bargain and i love marc 's but i will never come into this marc 's again . there 's a large sign over the front counter that says `` customer service '' but let me assure that 's fake news . there 's no such thing as customer service here . you ask an employee a question and they tell you `` i do n't work in close outs '' and walk away . you go to the customer service desk and hear `` ask someone in close outs '' - it 's just a store filled with people not willing to help .	3216
1	this is one of my new favorite stores . customer service is excellent here ! great selection . staff is very helpful suggesting products specific to your needs and letting you know about sale items and discounts . thanks guys !	2716
0	no refunds once they have your money that 's it there 's no exchanges ! do n't bother with this company ! ! ! ! most of the clubs are free if you 're a girl and if not you probably get tickets anywhere cheaper than going through this company because it 's by far the worst ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i hope this can help someone avoid the situation because i was going to book with them but forget it ! ! ! !	2122
1	i had waited a little late to bring my son to his first dentist appointment ( he is 5 ) . the hygienist nicole was absolutely wonderful with him . he was scared , but she took the time to ask him other questions and show him what each tool did . my son had a great experience and now he thinks he wants to be a dentist ! part of the reason i picked it is because of the train theme and my son loves trains , so this also helped immensely in calming him down . there 's a train out front where you can climb and take photos , plus everything in the place is train themed . great experience !	3004
0	made an appointment 1 month ago only to call to verify my appointment time and have them tell me that they made an error and never scheduled me and ca n't see me until next month . horrible customer service .	34
0	been back twice since i had the fried chicken sandwich and believe it or not both times i came back a manager/supervisor came over and told me they `` ran out of buttermilk chicken '' once i can understand twice your just incompetent . service was absolutely horrible you lost a customer	1417
1	this store is awesome when needing craft supplies for my 1st grade class art projects . i have been able to find everything that i need here . yes the lines have been long at times but this location is in a busy area so i get it . i go at times that may not be too busy . i had a very nice gentleman help me out the other day . he had a smile on his face and he actually looked like he enjoyed his job . great coupons to use plus they offer a teacher discount card . i appreciate the different selection of items that they sale compared to other places .	3943
0	welp . the food was pretty bland and it gave 2 out of 4 of us the runs .	600
1	my boyfriends mom and i went and it was so fun ! ! ! the dancers were amazing and very interactive with the crowd . they really made it a fun time !	2149
0	for several weeks i tried to start a full corporate membership here and the staff there could give a darn . i 'd use other words but they are not rated p.g . never in my life in the service industry have i seen a business held to such low standards . i called several times and left my information and never did i have one call returned . the customers here are treated like a nuisance and do n't get me started how the front desk/salesman completely lie to you when signing agreements . i 'd rate zero stars but they do n't let you . thank the lord snap fitness is right across the street .	3898
1	a lovely condominium development with about 900 palm trees , gated , three pools and spas , tennis , fitness center , clubhouse , onsite hoa which is very on hands keeping the development in great order . the surrounding area includes walk to gaming , dining , banking , shopping ... a great grocery store ... hospital and school . vistana is nestled in between spanish trail country club and rhodes ranch golf and country club . right across from the 215 with quick access to the strip . takes about 10 minutes to strip as well as the $ 750 million dollar shopping extravaganza town center . close to the downtown summerlin shopping and summerlin .	244
1	love the red bean slush there ... . plenty of whole red bean give you the texture of the drink and yet not too sweet ... this place can get crowded especially with teenagers ... so if you prefer a quiet corner to enjoy your drink , take it to go ; )	490
1	melissa gable has been cutting & coloring my hair for the past three years . she does an amazing job each time and is current on the latest trends and techniques . very highly recommended .	605
0	i purchased a wall clock in store , but unfortunately it stopped ticking . i changed the batteries out multiple times with different brands of batteries but nothing worked . i called customer service to exchange the product for a clock that was n't defective but customer service refused to help . this was n't consumer error ( it just hung on the wall , there 's no way it was ever damaged ) nor was i trying to get money back . i just wanted to replace their product that was defective . never shopping at kirklands again .	1576
1	having tried the beans and rice ( which does have pork in it by the way ) , the meatloaf , etc . but remains stuck at 3.5 stars , although they have consistently tasty preparation and not many places in town serve this kind of food , i 'm stymied by them pretty much sticking to po'boys ( see preview review ) and beans and rice every time i 'm by . would be nice to try the sweet potato poutine or the gumbo-laya . one nice thing to note if you ca n't pick between beans & rice and po'boy , you can go halfsies .	1007
1	i get the red curry thai hot ( just dont ask for thai hot and then some ... was numb the whole next day ha ha ) and my wife gets the pad thai mild . always very good and the owners are very nice.we always leave out of there with a couple thai iced teas which are very good also .	1450
1	i love that the sweet people who work here greet you kindly upon entering , and it seems sincere . the shop is cute , and the specials for which they are known -- strawberry latte , nutella pancake , and the like -- are just right for a sweet tooth . the caffe americano , black , is strong and rich , without much bitterness . i just do n't like the neighborhood , and parking can be a challenge .	1821
1	modern hotel . very clean . you have to pay to park which u would think that would be included in your cost . staff was very friendly ! there are a bunch of bars and restaurants very close by . i 'd stay again for sure !	3337
0	called and asked if an appointment was necessary and was told no . drove all the way there and the `` one '' person there told us that we did need one . oops ! ! ! oh well , we wo n't be coming back here and from the look of the place i do n't think that will be a bad thing .	3548
1	overall , i like the work that they did with my truck . i dropped my truck off around 8:45am and they called me around 11:50am to let me know it was all done . i did a quick glance over after i got the truck back and did not notice any over spray , dings , scratches , etc . i would definitely come back here again to get my bed sprayed .	203
0	food was good and service was good but the music was way too loud ! ca n't even have a conversation ! i love music but i could n't wait to get out of there ! our party of 10 will never go back since we could n't even enjoy each others company ! turn it down !	560
0	love the low prices here but half the time all of their gas pumps are out of order . yikes . i tend to go somewhere else now because they are not very reliable on having working pumps .	3057
0	waited an hour and a half for my first appointment . no one called me back , no one said anything . i finally ask and they say it will be another hour . are you kidding me ? i had a babysitter with my newborns . i ca n't be away from them for 2 and a half hours ! not only that , they used previous patients as the excuse .	676
1	terrible location but excellent products and staff ! : ) i came here on a sunday afternoon so parking was n't a problem . i parked in one of the residential streets .	2743
1	when i lived in charlotte this was one of my favorite places to catch a movie . i stopped going as often once the stonecrest cinemas opened but i would still go . the phillips place stadium 10 has plenty of before and after movie options . parking can be an issue on friday and saturday evenings .	3680
0	the worst place to have your car worked on i saw so many horrible things that this place did to people while waiting for my 4 hour oil change and now my service light is on , tire pressure light now . the worst ever if you get your car worked on here and have read this prior to then the only one to blame is yourself dont do it do n't be there next victim .	2146
0	has to be slowest one of all time.paid 4.15 for 2 large coffee an had to throw away so bitter ... was so hot i mean so hot ... i visit dd all over from massachusetts i know dd ... stay away from here .	1774
1	went to this shop for an oil change and an opinion of what some coolant leaks that i was totally aware of would cost to shore up ... .dee was very hospitable , and gave me a fair repair price helping me out wherever he could as the situation progressed . goodyear up the street tried to nail me for 8 hrs labor of which i knew was a much shorter job , of which dee showed me to be true and it was done in about half the time without having to replace a water pump that gyear said needed to go ... .i would recommend this place and will return .	2711
0	i came in today to return some fabrics . i know that this is not the most convenient thing in the world . i too have worked in retail but the woman helping me process the return in the fabric department , kaelin was very rude . she kept making comments such as `` what was the problem '' , `` wish me luck '' to her fellow coworkers and glaring at me . she took over for another young man who was initially helping me- he was great and very kind . i just found it very disrespectful for her to cop an attitude with me over a return . i will not be back to this store .	1937
0	ca n't find anyone need to cut a sheet of drywall all of the employees state at you ... f-	124
0	this is the second time i 've gotten food poisoning from this location . do n't bother going here .	3935
1	this pace is great i never set an appointment and every barber delivers excellence . one of my favorite barber shops hands down .	761
0	they wo n't honor free mango lassi from yelp ! ! ! ! . expensive and no rice or naan comes with dinner . if i was not in a hurry to eat i would have walked out . water glasses here is all different shape as if they ca n't afford to purchase same shape of glasses . there is hardly any customers inside of restaurant . food is horrible . stay away ! ! !	600
0	absolutely horrible . nail techs speak almost no english and my nails are terrible . they took 3 hours to do an acrylic fill with gel polish . at one point my nail tech stopped doing my nails to text on her cell phone . you could n't pay me to go back .	2297
1	great place , gives me great service and good cars , sometimes even free upgrades randomly haha . always rent from them when i am in town . watch out for the impala 's , the first time in years i have gotten a non teched out car . though if you are in for that , go for it !	3024
0	pathetic service ! pizza bar is disgraceful . 2 people ignored my family and i today . burned my pizza . i mean burnedwe order pizzas at a minimum of once per week . three years running ! lately , the people in this department have had poor attitudes . lazy and ignoring customers . but now it 's ridiculous . also , veganaise and refrigerated sections are seriously out of stock . poorly run store . only the basics we ca n't get anywhere else from now on for us . sad	433
1	the office front staff were fantastic , efficient , friendly , and my thanks to kim the ct scan tech , she was so competent , so proffesional explained what she was doing ... . she was very reassuring to a nervous frightened patient . ps..by the way , she is very attractive lady ... ...	188
1	this place is so fun we had the best time ! the staff is more then friendly & helpful , so happy i found this jem !	3326
0	i would love to but there is no option for me to send you a direct message . feel free to contact me .	643
1	seriously , how did i not know about this place before ? i brought my daughter here and was blown away by how cool it is ! she 's 2 1/2 years old and while some things are a little `` scary '' for her , like skeletons and some loud noises , the entire place was heaven for her . we went during the weekday , so it was n't crowded . the staff was super friendly and the interactive projects kept her fascinated for hours . it 's definitely a place for kids ! definitely a nice change from the children 's museum !	3891
0	i had the chicken katsura yesterday which was the first time i strayed from the burgers , big mistake . it was average at best , only burgers from here on . also , the tops of the napkin dispenser on the tables were very dusty . that being said i will be back soon for burgers .	964
1	i am having to visit social security office for the first time since the passing of my beloved husband and they have been understand and so helpful in the paperwork and red tape that i must go through in order to receive death benefits . there was no microscope yet , and hopefully will not . the staff especially the worker i have landed is kind and gentle with the severity of my mental state at this time . it makes the passing of chria a little easier with less stres	2598
0	i placed an order online for pick up at a specific time . when i got there , nobody knew what was going on . someone had to find the order , then i got to see her argue with a cook to make the meal . after he insulted her , she made it herself . all in all , it took longer than it should have for a pick up order , and i got to see a really awkward argument . disappointing , but the food was pretty good .	1365
1	love love loved our experience here ! ! 6 girls for a birthday party , brought in champagne & our nails turned out fabulous !	3450
0	i wish i could give negative stars to this business . they advertise , '' all the washes you would like , '' for their fastpass plan , but this is not the case . i had a wash in early afternoon , got sprayed with fluids from a car that exploded in front of me and returned to the wash to be denied another wash. one wash per day is what the girl wash employee told me . do you want to do business with someone that clearly falsely advertises ?	1790
1	stayed here for a business trip 1/12-1/16 . it was great- the hotel is modern , clean , comfortable , and convenient . their bistro has a great breakfast , and the staff was very welcoming . if i was ever in the area again , i 'd definitely stay here !	2188
1	had my first experience at a blow out bar and loved it ! such a cute shop , girls were super friendly . i called and no one answered , they called and text me right back ! me and my girlfriend did n't have an appointment but they were able to get us in . highly recommend and would absolutely go back again . i ca n't wait to !	1423
1	i want to change my original review . i was contacted personally but the owner who apologized for the staff nor getting back to me or following up and not receiving my gas card . she did promise to send me a check for the amount of the gas card . i will post an update in a week or two . as for the service , i would have went 5 stars but the guy who put the order in , ordered the wrong windshield for my car so they had to come back the next day . thankfully that was a saturday morning early so i was home .	200
1	i love them . really good service . and their product are all from korea , the owner is knowledgeable and patient . i love their 24k golden mask . the best facial and body beauty service in town .	2647
0	i have been here several times and the service is pretty poor . from the service dept to parts , it seemed as if i was an inconvienece to them . i will do business with them as needed . when i get a choice i go somewhere else , even if it cost me a little more . they seem to be very knowedgable but thats where it ends . store is very clean and well maintained .	195
0	i have gone here a few times before and the food was ok i mean it 's chipotle . but i went yesterday and i seem to have food poisoning a few short hours after eating a steak burrito with dairy ( cheese sour cream ) . this is the first time of the 5-6 times i have been here , but would n't return after this unpleasant ordeal . my friends who had chicken/steak bowls also felt unwell after eating here for dinner .	1418
0	rude ! ! ! ! ! ! i brought in my elderly client and the receptionists told me on the phone a different time . not even a hello , hi , or greeting and the hairstylists just said `` he 's early '' and `` he 's going to have to wait '' ... ok , great , not a problem ! i had to walk out because the smells were so toxic ! no fan systems , no air circulating . i 'm younger and this salon is geared at older people .	3178
1	i just finished all my treatments ! ! ! i have no hairs period , i use to be so hairy on my linea alba , but i swear after the first treatment you start seeing results not to mention the staff is very friendly and nice my favorite one is iris shes wonderful ! ! ! overall this place is amazing i recommend this to anyone who wants laser hair removal you wont be disappointed ! ! : ) & they have monthly payment plans so it affordable as well ! ! ! ! ! ! ! yayy im so happy with ideal image they rock ! !	3019
0	this was a horrible experience , the guy soaked my carpet and it was wet for days . i used a coupon and got the extra special `` you use coupon , you receive terrible cleaning '' job . total waste of time and money , carpet is worse then before he came by . so thank you sears for your junk coupons & horrible cleaning guy .	3777
0	tech department is very unorganized . the lady that worked there was very rude and condescending . someone should really evaluate her position with the company . i 'm over her attitude	583
0	i 've had food here once before and it was pretty great . i recently got an order of pad thai and fresh basil rolls fulfilled through postmates . this is probably the most expensive thai restaurant in the area , even before the postmates fees . the portion size for the pad thai was very generous , but the rice paper wrapper around the basil rolls was tough and the rolls themselves were pretty flavorless . the pad thai itself did n't have enough sauce or something ... it just did n't taste all that good . i recommend going to thai house university instead .	50
0	i went there yesterday evening and the place is okay . the lady assisting was nice , but the food however sucked i had order 2 burritos de asada and a taco de asada for my bf and i . the meat was very dried after i told the lady i wanted a little bit of beans multiple times i ended up getting them with a ton of beans . long story short both of us are now in bed with food poisoning puking our lives away.. this is the worst pepe 's i 've been to never again am i going back there i rather eat at taco y taco or tacos el gordo .	857
0	going downhill quick . the last few times we 've ordered , fries have been undercooked , items forgotten , under seasoned fries . i hope they get it together ! our kid loves it and it 's one of the few take out places we get .	1395
1	love the food here , but is kinda expensive for fast food	566
1	love that they now have an on-campus location . the menu is n't as big as the one downtown but if you ask ( and they have the resources ) they will make you pretty much anything from the downtown menu . still have a wide variety of things on their smaller menu and a great on-the-go sushi option for students on campus . this is my fave sushi place on campus : )	912
0	disappointed ... overpriced for tiny cupcakes ... i was not impressed , i can make better cupcakes from a box . will not return .	2507
0	worst service experience in my life . three different cleaners for their company cancelled within 15 minutes of their scheduled times . plus , they still charged for the non-service and then gave us a credit for future service .	2623
0	screwed up another order . why do i trust you guys ? i have to learn to stop coming here .	994
1	ryan in sales really showed customer service . that is hard to find these days . he was willing to work with my family 's busy schedule , texting when i could n't go in . i really appreciated that . smooth and fast process . choose carter powersports !	195
0	the customer service at this location was a joke . i requested to speak with a manager and the manager was even more rude than the associate . i ultimately left and went to another location where i was treated fairly and like i was valued .	3037
1	this is my go to walmart , last visited on june 5 , 2016 to buy some personal care items such as shaving cream , hand soap , as well as some groceries such as avocado and banana . the banana was at 56 cents and was perfect , not too raw not too ripe . the avocado selection was also perfect for ripeness . the cashier was quick and swift . the lines were not too long at 9pm .	3721
0	average hotel for a high average price for the area . when they put the new runway in they had to surgically remove a couple of floors from this place and as such it got a complete makeover . rooms are clean , bed is very comfortable and you can find this place for around 100 bucks if you search around . over all , nothing special in my opinion ... it would be a great place at 60-70 bucks but at over 100 it offers very little value for what they are asking in my opinion . parking is extra too .	51
1	thank you rubalcabas great service the cashier lady that works in graveyard she is asome , and very good menudo this is one of my fast food favorite restaurants .	791
1	very friendly staff , great customer service and you get priority points ( igh ) . the rooms are outdated but decent . close to scarborough town centre and the 401 . plenty of parking space at the back ** free parking ! ! ! would stay here again without any hesitation .	700
0	the workers here get really stressed when the lunch crowd comes in , which makes the queue even longer ! one complained to me that they get miserable pay and poor working conditions . not to be rude but i 'm a hungry patron not a labour attorney , its just a tad out of place . i resent that police and city workers get a 50 % discount here but unlv students and staff , right across the street , are unremarkable . the food here is extremely salty ! if you have cardiovascular or diabetic concerns do not eat here .	1365
1	an interesting experience . the food was good . not amazing . i really enjoyed talking with my date in the dark . only thing i did n't like was that they cut up my steak . i would 've like to take on that challenge myself . fun place . note : they do n't serve drinks in the lounge	449
0	i could n't help but feel like a sucker for paying $ 12.99 to get a casual dress dry cleaned here . all of the signage indicated much cheaper prices such as suits for $ 8.99 or three pairs of pants for $ 9.99 . so why was my dress $ 12.99 plus tax ? i did n't ask the price ahead of time which was my mistake but there was no explaination as to why it would cost more than all of the listed prices . it felt sexist . i 'll just never go there again .	3391
0	review by carly l , invalid she is the owners daughter so therefore she is biased and clueless as to what the dining experience is at this location . by the way , the restuarant due to all of its wonderfulness is now closed .	489
0	my brother checked in there for treatment , he spent 5 days there and unfortunately he lost his insurance , so desert hope kicked him out on the street . they feed you a lot of b.s . this is a money hungry organization and has nothing to do with treatment . do n't recommend , unless you are rich .	2809
0	this place is a joke . yes , you will get your phone fixed fast but there will be screws missing ( ca n't see them , it will only affect your phone ) , the screen will be crooked , etc . they totally screwed up my husband and my phone . a much better place is mac media ; they are actual professionals .	3817
0	i have used sky harbor for years but service is getting worse and worse . gate people are quite rude and pick up service from airport was 12 min . one time and today over 20 min . management needs to take a good look at staffing and customer service . they also take people to sundance as well as some hotels . many options for similar pricing	2531
1	this store is always clean and has a great staff . everyone is friendly & helpful . great selection & really great deals . especially compared to other resale outlets ( including other savers )	3679
0	so many better places to go on freemont ... .	3326
0	horrible . young kids fooling around throwing towels back and forth and cussing in spanish which i understand . probably will never be back . also my order was to go and i ordered in house purposely . ala cart only . no rice and beans from here that 's for sure . disgusting oil and cold . gross ! ! ! ca n't compare to tempe location . what a shame . loss of $ 20 tonight	1194
1	we have been taking our 2 yr old wheaten there for grooming since we got him . we love our groomer hillary ! she knows our dog and he knows	3917
1	the 2 hours spent inside was a mix of adolescence and adrenaline . i felt like a toddler who was taken to the playground for the first time . learnt a lot , and i had a lot of fun here . definitely recommend you check this place out with the family or even a group of friends . ps : ask for their student discount ! pss : cmu students get in free !	1924
0	i have been coming to this office for over 10 years . now that my dr is no longer at this office i really do n't see a need to come back . front desk lady is n't too friendly , or she may be having a bad day . regardless its showing . my appointment was at 10:30 , came early to fill out my yearly chances paperwork , it is now 11:35 and i 'm still waiting in the waiting room to be seen . not sure how much longer it will be and then i still will have to wait for the dr when i finally reach the room . very disappointing .	3059
0	i would honestly learn how to work on cars myself before ever returning to this location . the employee was rude , condescending , and too busy to assist . i was told to `` come back later '' but was not allowed to make an appointment . i went to discount tire where the simple service i needed was handled quickly and by a friendly staff member .	3860
0	really bad place . extremely long wait times and bad attitude front desk personnel . after putting up with all their issues they still could not even remove some warts . stay away .	1677
0	they 're slow as hell and rude . which i do n't understand because as a barista myself out on the lv strip , one other coworker and i would get a rush and we would never be so slow . these baristas get 2-4 customers and it takes 15-30 minutes just to get an iced coffee . also , the iced coffees here only come in one size which is sort of a bummer , not their fault though . just a heads up if you 're looking to get anything bigger .	1351
0	all these amazing reviews , i feel let down . with 5 people in my group , there should have at least been one person with a good meal . volcano chicken : horrible . over-fried , crispy , and could n't taste the chicken . we even had 3 orders of different spicy levels . chicken pad thai : weird . the noodles were pink ( ? ? ) and had a fishy flavor . the chicken was basically flavorless . chicken massaman curry : just ok . nothing outstanding . bummer ! ! we really wanted to like this place , too !	1203
1	a young man in shoes helped me find the match to a pair of boots i wanted ! accelyn morton was so helpful and knowledgeable ! ! thank you for your excellent service ! ! go belks ! !	2910
0	been here 20 minutes . no service . not crowded post pitt game ? ? ? ? no clue . we are trying to get help and asked for help ten minutes ago . nothing . just went the next day . got chefs game on , then lied and said people upstairs were mad . no people upstairs asked for ant tv for chiefs , no tv . so it was n't upstairs at all . horrible service . do n't go .	2532
0	0 stars for this one ! ! ! wow , what a waste of time ! ! ! we pre ordered our tickets on line and went with my brother who bought tickets there . he was able to buy tokens when he paid for admission while we waited longer in line to get in and no tokens ! ! ! tokens took another line of over an hour ! if waiting in line for tacos , water , drinks , food , anything this is the place for you . most unorganized event i 've been to . will never go again . save your money and party at home !	1392
0	this was the worst hotel i have ever stayed at . i paid for a suite on the club level floor expecting it to be luxury and it was the farthest thing from it . the mattress did n't even have a bed frame , they put a mattress under my mattress and there was no frame . my air conditioner in my club level suitw was broken and was blowing hot air the whole time . the receptionist at the front desk was very rude and did n't treat me with any respect . i do not recommend anyone to ever stay in this hotel . trust me save your money .	3166
1	they know me because that 's how often i come to eat here . very good food and personable service . pad thai or duck curry are my go-to . patron since 2006 , and will continue to recommend .	895
1	amazing pastries that truly give a homemade perfection vibe . i have never been dissapointed with my order , and i highly reccomend the lady locks .	896
0	awful customer service . i came up to the counter with a pair of shoes to exchange and both girls were lacing shoes , looked very annoyed that was bothering them and after an awkward silence one finally said `` hi '' without eye contact and an attitude . one of the girls was very vocal and made it obvious that they did n't have the pair of shoes i was looking for . however she approached this with `` nope . no . no we do n't have those '' and walking away . the whole experience has made me want to never return to this store which is unfortunate because i love it normally .	2861
0	the quality of the hotel is beyond disgusting . the room smells like carpet showered with human pee all lover and then sprinkled with this strong carpet freshner . but the pee smell prevailed ! everything is outdated and rusty and old and broken . i ca n't believe i paid for my family to stay here . i would never have stayed there even if they gave me couple of hundred dollars have i known better . **you 've been warned**	2976
1	i love love love this place ! ! i would move in , if they 'd let me . there is such a cool , clean , happy vibe about the surroundings . the nail tech that has done my nails & toes a few times is the best i 've been to ! ( sorry , i ca n't tell you her name because i need to see her : ) ) the only problem i have is that i always end up buying something super fabulous from the retail area they have . arrive a little early & shop before your paws are wet ! !	3502
1	i love this park even though it 's out of the way . there are lots of things to see like ducks , swans , turtles and fish . they have a cool dinosaur themed playground that my inner child could definitely appreciate ! there is also a mini water park for the kids when it gets too hot . i wish there was one for adults because i seriously wanted to slide or run through the water . if i ever come here again i 'd love to set up a blanket by the water and have a traditional picnic under a tree .	367
0	overly priced with poor service and good food . i ordered sparkling water for myself and ended up paying eight dollars for a large bottle . i should have checked the prices but the waiter made me feel that it would be individually priced . then we ordered tea which was not served until after we received our bill .	600
0	brutal : great location , great facility , clean bathroom . the service was the worst i 've had in years , maybe ever . it took 90 minutes from the time i entered the establishment to the time i left . i had a ceasar salad and a water . how ... ? how ... ? how ... ? could this order take over 60 minutes to prepare . most establishments want to turn over the table and get the next customer . the salad itself was wilted and on par with fast food quality which is ok for 8 bucks , but not for 18.00 . i wo n't return until i 've heard there is a change of management .	630
0	this place is very out dated and pricey for the atmosphere . there are far better salons in vegas than to subject yourself to this one !	1617
0	super disappointed in delivery services . got a broken dryer delivered to me on saturday . trying to get it delivered asap on monday but getting someone on the phone who knows something has proven impossible . since speaking with several home depot representatives i am even more upset . apparently their schedule is booked until friday so i have to wait an extra week for delivery when it was their mistake . missing 2days of work so far is ridiculous .	124
1	i been to lumberjacks few times with my family and we love there food . i wish they would stay open all day . great place for food	1319
0	their service area map includes basically the entire phoenix metro area , and yet when i called , they said they did n't serve my particular area ( near 21st ave and cactus . ) the cutoff is bell , which is less than a mile north of me . ridiculous . i wish i could rate them based on the quality of the goods they provide , but considering they wo n't even make the effort ...	3235
1	i truly believe that totally baked cookie could be the key to world peace . this is exactly what everyone needs in their life . fresh baked cookies ? delivered to your door ? ? with ice cream ? ! uhh yes ! ! ! i 've ordered from them twice and they are always super nice , very prompt and have the greatest warm , homemade cookies ever ! although i hate myself for eating 4 to 6 cookies late at night i 'm always happy with this scrumptious treat !	1522
1	i went to many dealerships before coming to sands kia and i was more than thrilled with my experience ! jim s. was a great salesman , no b.s . he made the whole process a breeze.. and i was no easy buyer . carlos j was also a very nice guy , he explained the finance part very well and was eager to answer any questions . overall , i was so please with everyone here . if you head over there for a kia talk to jim ! he 's a good guy !	624
0	it 's good food , but the prices are just insane . for a cup of soup , a sandwich , and a drink , i paid $ 18 . this is straight up highway robbery . i wo n't be eating here again unless they lower the prices . also the selection is pretty slim .	1238
1	i usually see the pa linda rosenberg . she is great . she listened and helped me with my back problem . my parents have both had good experience with dr. wickler	2631
0	i wanted to like this place ! it 's so close to my house , and touts itself as the gourmet option over the brass taps . the pizza was pretty mediocre . it was n't the thin crusted variety i was hoping for , and the flavour was n't anything special . the pasta was just okay , too . i probably wo n't be going back because the price is a bit high for the value .	252
1	ava always does a fabulous job ! i leave dino 's loving my hair ! i also love our conversations while getting pampered ! : )	2828
1	just an updated rating.. i think i rushed to a 5 star before . while the tortas are still excellent and love the avocado fries with that sauce.. however i had chicken fajitas yesterday and i would n't get them again . not a lot of flavor and the chicken just was n't prepared the way i would like it .	1358
0	i do n't know why i keep coming back here . the food is mediocre at best . go spend a few more dollars at imperial garden up the road . this is your run of the mill chinese buffet .	1575
1	the pool agency has the best customer service , and keeps my pool sparkly clean ! they are prompt and accomodating with extra services needed . after i `` fired '' myself as the `` pool girl '' , i have been extremely happy with the excellent service and performance of my pool !	3479
0	we went here while waiting for our room and the bartender ( not busy at all ) was rude . sluffed it off . next night , we were waiting to meet our group in the lobby and a friend went there to get a drink and her response when she returned was 'that bartender was a real a**hole ' . different bartender . do you not realize you work for tips ?	3343
1	my favorite restaurant especially the pork cutlet and the minced beef spaghetti and milk tea . amazing service , have been coming here for a few years already . never once disappointed me .	464
1	i have been to many , many starbucks in my day all over the country and this location hands down has the best customer service i 've ever experienced . literally every single person here went above and beyond to be nice and helpful . i like to try something new every time i come in and they made suggestions and asked questions to help me make up my mind . i bought breakfast , and they even walked my food out to me . like , who does that ? i am seriously impressed . i will go out of my way to come to this location .	1996
1	beware that because this is located at the airport there are long lines . our service representative , josh , was a great help in solving a ridiculous situation we encountered with orbitz .	2134
0	we went to your restaurant twice before and the food we ordered were just so so . i figured maybe if we order something different we might find something good . we took my daughter and son-in-law for lunch today and boy was i embarassed of the food they ordered . one order was the tripple decker turkey sandwich , i figured what can go wrong with a turkey sandwich ? i have never seen a turkey sandwich made out of a canned turrkey meat . the other one was a fish taco . the fish was taken from a frozen breaded fish and fried . the fried rice wad soooo oily with no taste at all . ntc	57
0	they definitely need to fire there staff . what kind of worker does n't even greet you with a simple hello ? ? ? ? waste of money and time . take your money to fat tuesday at least for drinks anyway	2021
1	amazing food and staff were good too . after long time i went to india buffet as its gets so full , recently when in vegas we looked for some decent indian food , and oh waaa ! this place was just great . loved the ambiance of the restaurant very neat and clean . the menu spread was just fine , dessert was good too . keep it up the good quality and service . thank you !	600
0	i called to ask if they could do black colored acrylic , was told yes but once i was seated they said they only had glittery black . i said it was okay since i was already started . he was rough with the file and drill , my nail beds were burning and they still hurt hours later . the acrylic is lumpy and uneven , doesnt cover all of my nails in some spots . it felt very rushed even though there was only one other client in the salon . disappointed .	3572
0	cash only , which they do n't advertise till the moment they bring the bill . however they charge hst and in my case server was n't friendly and did n't even pretend being grateful for extra tip . slow service , cheap decor , food is ok but nothing special for the prices above average . do n't recommend ! ! !	134
0	therapist are good people , company horrible . my daughter has cerebral palsy and i have been waiting for disability and medicaid to give me an answer if they will help me with her medical bills . i have private insurance but need help with deductibles and copays . i owe my left foot approx $ 400 and they are not willing to wait for response or on a payment plan , they have also denied therapy for my daughter until paid in full . last week i received a noticed from them from small claims i am being sued . these people are in business for the money do n't really care about the children 's needs .	2015
1	cvs pharmacy is one of my one-stop shopping . while waiting for my prescription i can go shopping for groceries and pick up some cat and dog food for my animals and i ca n't forget about my little fishy etc . i would definitely recommend checking out this cvs pharmacy its under new management and i can see the improvement . so i would definitely stop in and check out the new changes with the new friendly staff new management and the wonderful pharmacy staff .	2080
1	great food and drinks . solid vibe and great servers . had the burger - love that alberta beef !	1812
0	how are the reviews so high ? the pho was alright at best . the main problem was the rice dishes..the rice was evident that it was overnight rice and just simply reheated . it was hard and dry . the chicken was cooked to death . tough and dry , exactly like chewing on leather . the beef also had a burnt taste . definitely would not come back . huge waste of money .	707
0	i am a professional realtor and just had the experience of dealing with this company and would not recommend them . they did not perform the drilling on a termite treatment until called to the carpet and asked to complete the service . even then they did not complete the drawing showing a thorough treatment as required by the state .	1728
0	this hotel gave horrible service . their security made our situation dangerous by having drunk people puking and destroying the hallways . the lady at the front desk was extremely rude and made the situation worse . cops were called and complicated the situation making the stay extremely unpleasant . dont stay here ! prices are cheep so party animals destroy the hotel . look at the pictures for proof !	1741
0	i tried emailing you but the email bounced back . i even wrote from then donato website ... nothing from donatos . did not know why i bothered because clearly you do not care about your customers . thanks for nothing .	2509
0	hopefully with new management they will be better . there is a short girl with pink hair that works here who is super rude , talks badly about employees and customers in front of others . she lies about things to upper management as well . she 's rude to everyone there . chandler and tempe are your best bet for trade , those two locations actually know what they are doing .	2115
1	i was in mesa for the morning and found this gem . i was greeted with a big smile and friendly service . the almond latte was really good , like really good ! if i lived in mesa , i 'd be a regular for the friendliness , good coffee , and really nice environment . it was busy , but nice and quiet - a feature that seems a bit rare in my experience . if i need coffee in mesa again , this will be my go to place .	3520
1	very nice company to work with . friendly staff , too . needed a part , they had it . turns out needed to return part as it was defective from the manufacturer and they took care of it . would do business with them again .	2833
1	good prices and selection with a convenient location ( for me at least ) ! will definitely be going back .	1747
1	as soon as you walk in your greeted , as soon as you wander in a different department your greeted , as soon as you think you have a question ... ... your greeted ! if you have that look like you have to go to the bathroom ... ..your greeted ! lol but seriously , they greet you at every turn . it 's not annoying , because you might just have a thought as soon as they ask you . although we did n't find what we were looking for , it was a good experience . hubby chit chatted with another special forces guy that worked there . it was a very good experience .	439
1	my favorite hookah lounge by far . great people very attractive staff and reasonable prices	1229
0	my boyfriend used 1-800 flowers for his choice and they used az florist . he asked for sunflowers , not sure what he paid and he does n't know i 've left this review but i was pretty disappointed . i 'll follow up when i find out what the cost was . i 've attached pictures so you can see for yourself . overall , the arrangement was what i love . a spring feel , wild flowers . but we could 've gone and picked better flowers ourselves . in this modern world of big name florists , being able to rely on a small florist to do their job well is important . i wo n't purchase here ever .	38
1	dr. deka and all the staff i have felt with at this office has been wonderful ! i go a lot as i am pregnant with twins so i have more appts than normal . i have never had trouble with scheduling , getting labs , or anything . i 'm a bit of a worry wart and if i ever have a concern they get me in as soon as possible . dr. deka had the best bedside manner out there and is very knowledgeable !	1589
0	i was extremely disappointed by this location . i had appointments scheduled at 130 , 2 and 215 for myself and children . i arrived at 115 to complete paperwork . no one was taken back until 230 and at that time i was told that we would have an additional hour or more wait since we were new patients . i 'm incredibly disappointed with this facility and their lack of promptness .	3292
0	the last two times i have been here the quality of food and cleanliness of the facility has significantly dropped off . the chicken was cold and the batter was not crispy at all . the egg roll looked like it was cooked hours before and reheated . the tables were not wiped clean and the overall feel of this place was neglect .	237
1	third baby delivered and another amazing experience with this office and dr. deka . she 's truly an amazing and compassionate physician . from your first appt to your last , you wo n't be disappointed . office staff greets you by your name , everyone is kind and the office runs on time .	1589
1	spot was great . a dive sure but a great dive . bartender ca n't remember her name but was a milf . i 'd definitely go there again . wings were n't bad either . but yea bartender was a hot milf .	371
0	it was always a pleasure getting the happy hour half off shakes , but not last night . my sister and i went to this store to buy shakes last night . after 3 hours of consuming those said shakes , we both had gotten food poisoning . i was awake all night long , but my sister who ordered a small sized shake , felt a bit better than i was . i 'm going to contact the corporate about this .	844
0	not worth the price . i have been to the atlanta aquarium which is 2x nicer , larger , and more interactive at the same price .	706
0	this resort is over-used and under-maintained . bbqs did n't work . noisy at 5am from staff rolling their carts down the sidewalk . smoking is allowed almost everywhere , even stinky cigars . printer has n't worked in the business center for a week but no sign on it .	1057
1	favorite place for takeout . their lo mein is great , and the reason i come here 1-2 times per week .	1249
1	i 've been using this location as my favorite place to get ice cream for more than 10 years , i love the ice cream that cold stone has and no one else prepares it the way they do . my one complaint is they often run out of chocolate sprinkles , besides that they have the best selection of desserts , including cakes .	1523
1	grabbed a quick breakfast before an early morning flight . enjoyed the scrambler ( eggs , hash browns , sausage ) . service was good ( and fast ) and prices were very reasonable . would definitely recommend this vs a basic coffee shop , especially before a long flight .	1400
1	the store its self is great but let me tell you about the employees : not to friendly especially in the morning ... they really need to be taught good manners ... i walked in an said hello an the lady rolled her eyes at me an i thought that was really rude .	3005
1	i 'm from hk and always have craving for food at home . this shop is known for dessert but this time i 'm here for some solid food . must try the deep fried squid , best i 've tried in gta but on the salty side . steamed rice roll with all sauce is awesome and brings back memory . the highlight was the steamed flos cordyorps & pork tenderloin with rice in hot pot . 30 mins wait but totally worth it , best on a cold day !	1062
1	if you 're in cuyahoga falls and needing a quick bite , then most definitely give retro dog a chance . this is a great concept : old-school hot dogs , hamburgers , and sides . a simple menu with high-quality ingredients is right up my alley , and nothing at retro dog disappointed . they even have great veggie options for anyone who 's not a meat lover . the stuff is super friendly , and the food comes out hot , fresh , and fast . what 's not to love , right ?	953
0	signed up for a second year at this facility- the first time i signed up they told me no one was available to talk to about the place and the features . go in again and even though i 've been there they did n't even tell me anything about it again- just take your money , enroll your fingerprint ... the locker room and shower smells like a dead cat or something- real gross . i 've still never had anyone tell me about classes , the amenities , equipment , circuits-nothing . fine if all you want work out on is older equipment . this place is in desperate need of an update .	392
0	a farmers market should generally have vegetables . this place has a poor selection and is overpriced . i want to like this place , but it 's overpriced junk . better off participating in a csa .	2488
0	my son seen dr. piacentine for the first time and he seem very nice and was able to answer all my questions . i then moved and needed to transferred my son 's medical records to a different doctor . they said that the doctor looked through and tossed all the non important papers away . so out of all my son 's records i only now have just a few and all the really important papers are gone . it 's against the law to through away medical records that are for a minor . i do not recommend this place ! ! ! ! !	3893
0	i 'm afraid the reviews for this company were all written by its owners and employees . all 5 stars ? normally , people write reviews to complain about something went bad . suspicious ...	32
0	i have had not one pleasant experience this company . the drivers are unprofessional . most of the cars are filthy .	1232
1	we loved our stay at this hotel ! courteous and friendly staff especially nube ! it is about a 12-minute walk to the yonge-englinton station . eglington street has a wide variety of great restaurant choices ! only cons when we came were : construction next door old furniture inside the room and carpet feels and smells moldy pool area can use some nice umbrellas and seating limited parking and their is a parking fee although most hotels in this area probably has a parking fee we would stay here again !	2865
0	i usually do n't like writing bad reviews but it happens every time i call for parts . i 'm treated horribly and talk to you like if you know nothing . they are rude and put you on hold when ever they feel like it . the only reason i go to them is for parts because they are the only ones with these parts in town . super poor customer service .	3914
0	did the 60 minutes foot massage . not only it was the worst massage ever . it was the most ridiculous experience ever . the masseuse demanded a 30 % gratuity . i have never heard such a thing .	2399
1	awesome breakfast ! ! ! had the rubin benedict and wow was it good ! loved it ! ! kid friendly & mom approved , in fact she had the florentine benedict ... good service and prices .	325
1	hands down , the best experience i 've had ever with a plumbing company ! ! they did not charge a ridiculously high fee for coming out on a sunday night . in fact it was considerably less than i expected . we ended up needing a new water heater so that fee was waived anyways . it was installed , perfectly , in less than 24 hours . our plumber , jarred , was amazing . knowledgeable , honest , funny and good with my kids . i will only use this company from now on and have recommended them to everyone i know !	1015
1	the restaurants was clean - service was super friendly . the variety of donuts are amazing - the donuts are amazing in taste not for calorie counters .	2053
1	pepe tacos is my favorite place to eat soft tacos ! i am a beef lover but their chicken soft taco is more tasty . i like their green and red sauce . their meat and product are fresh ! they chopped the meat as you place the order usually i do n't like corn tortilla but theirs does n't have that strong taste : ) i like their pineapple juice so refreshing ! staff is very helpful specially when the whole menu appeals you if happens sometime that i just go their by myself it 's open 24h/7h so if you like real good tacos , pepe is the place price is very descent for the quality !	857
1	amazing facial with nicki ( sorry if misspelled ) . i 've had many facials but she by far exceeded my expectations , i unfortunately had to switch from hydrafacial to express due to pregnancy and spa rules about the led lights or something but nicky totally made up for it by listening to all my concerns and using specific products based on exactly what i complained of or needed to help improve my skin . it 's rare to find someone so informed and enthusiastic but she is both ! thanks so much nicky ! and i 'm loving the lancer method polish and instalift so i 'm sure i 'll be back soon to buy the rest of the products you recommended !	2651
0	had our dining set 2 years now , light usage , 2 broken chairs and very scratched table with cracked laminate . extended warrenty does nothing . try and call the store , you ca n't , get a call center in california that gives terrible service . worst business i have ever purchased from .	2071
1	this is typically the walmart location i end up at based on convenience . the service is typically good and the lines can be busy on weekends during peak times , but for the most part , the store keeps their lines to a minimum by opening more registers when they are busiest . this is especially helpful during he holidays . i recently noticed the signs at the registers saying they will open a new register any time there are more than three people in the line waiting . they keep a good amount of stock on the shelves and they are clean and organized as well .	2443
0	save your money , and do n't go here . this place is so stuck up ! we went in there , and walked the entire store , and not a single person acknowledged us . the sales people were not busy , chit chatting with each other about outside of work topics . no thanks .	439
0	this is the location closest to my house . there is a civic and a jetta here that never seem to be available during the week or on the weekend .	2232
1	right near the guy-concordia station , this is a good restaurant with fairly diverse offerings of chinese , singapore and thai dishes . service was quick and efficient on a busy saturday afternoon . i had the singapore curry beef which was quite good , the beef tender and the veggies crisp . the price was quite good for the amount of food -- $ 11 .	1016
1	for tourists unfamiliar with the area , this was a really fun place . my husband and i stopped in after roaming the downtown area and we were seated right away ( we went on a saturday evening ) ! our waitress was so friendly and was ready with recommendations . the food was okay , we had some appetizers , tasters like ordinary pub food . they also did not have a huge beer selection but we tried the pale ale and it was tasty . its a great place to come if you 're downtown and are looking for a place to relax while having good beer and pub food .	670
0	as of right now , i was disappointed . most of the donuts are 2.75 . pretty steep for a donut . love local places . but i tried three kinds and none of them were really a wow : ( but i wish them luck and hope to give more stars another time . the reason for the low stars is that i do n't feel the high price is really justified .	1643
1	harry did an amazing job on my gel manicure and pedicure . the gel lasted for over 3 weeks , no peeling or chipping-i was impressed ! i will definitely be coming back and telling my friends about this place !	1288
1	we stayed here on 2 occasions . i was pleasantly surprised at the very reasonable rates and great location . it 's located near the subway and within walking distance ( though a bit of a loooong walk ) to mount royal . the centre bell is like right around the corner , which was a convenience since we caught a game . the floors are clean wood or laminate . no filthy carpeting here . bathroom is large , gift shop on premises and a restaurant downstairs . espresso available at front desk and employees were very friendly .	1680
1	out of all the spanish places in vegas i fell in love with this place alot . ive been here about 4 times now and every single time i never left dissapointed . im a big meat head and believe me when i say they are very generous with their meat . most places ill go to ill order something and theres barely anything on it and alot of vegies and what not , but this place never dissapoints .	791
0	$ 12 sloppy joe with a kraft single on top ! raw dough on homemade bread ! tuna was dry ! disappointing to say the least . this was my second time and i will not return . the prices reflect that they are using top of the line ingredients which is not the case . i gave it 1 star because the server was nice .	1402
1	super nice , the lady did what i wanted but if you want them shorter or a different shape let her know before she did n't ask	1306
0	my one star is for the staff only . i have no problem with either dr pierrend or dr yonan . but when you have a 91 year old father whose care is in your hands and you ca n't get a response from his doctors ' office , that 's a problem . i seriously should have read the comments on here before i chose to take him there . currently looking for another office to take my dad .	2987
0	stay away ! these are not the musicians that in earlier years graced the world with angelic children singing christmas prayers to pachelbel 's canon in d. this is a show in which the musicians spend more time turning their heads to throw their hair over their shoulder than listening to the balance between the limited orchestra and their instruments and voices . even the light show could not make up for the sophomoric performance . we fled midway through the performance when it was clear that a grade school concert would have more musical value . what a waste of time and money .	2968
1	she is the best ! very friendly and professional . i never liked having eyelash extensions because i felt it is too much work to try to make it last longer and do the daily care so purchasing it on groupon was completely spontaneous but now i 'm glad i did ! it 's my first time actually like to have them i will keep coming back for refills ! look so beautiful and it lasts way longer than others .	3639
1	i had read the previous reviews and all i can say is they must have gone through some major changes . the room was nice for the price , less than 100 after taxes and the room had a fridge and microwave . staff was super friendly especially tina . they have a shuttle , which was a bonus . beds were good , linens were crisp and fresh . they also have a nice clean pool and spa and laundry facilities . there was even an attached sports bar type lounge . all in all i would definitely stay there again .	1335
1	good hotbar - $ 5 rotisserie chicken - $ 6/lb hotbar items open til midnight walk in beer cooler	1735
0	these guys had no clue that they have happy hour shakes.. even though it 's advertised ! ! total mess ! no clue ! ! had to call neighboring sonic	844
0	dr. johnsen is knowledgeable and nice enough . his p.a . seemed nice and knowledgeable as well . however , when i tried to call back , three times , i never heard back ... from anyone . i was just trying to get clarification between what the pharmacist said , and the p.a . said . i was finally able to hear back from someone ... four hours later .	1225
1	i absolutely love getting my eyebrows waxed and tinted at the benefit brow bar ! alex always does the best job , and i enjoy chatting with her - she is always so friendly !	2479
1	i went there for first time the service was awesome only issue was menu was kind of weak i would if expected more drinks and food but great service	704
1	they do charge $ 5 for gel polish removal even with a service which i do n't find at all places but they do a very good job and take their time	3607
1	went in looking for living room furniture . we come about an hour and a half , so we 're serious about finding what we needed . big shout to tim callahan for all the help before and after the sale . we appreciate his desire for us to be happy with our purchase and we are . will definitely be back . kim and dale , kingman az	439
1	we met some friends here for lunch . the place was busy but we were seated quickly . our server samantha was prompt with drink and food orders . she was very attentive to our needs even though her area was very busy ... thanks samantha for the awesome service my friends and will definitely be back .	428
0	do not go into this car wash with a car without scratches , do not go into this car wash if you have recently waxed your car . the cleaning devices pick up impurities over the course of the day , week , month . 1 speck of sand will make the design impractical for newer cars . the wash will also remove wax and help you discover deeper problems . of course they will tell you you need a polish , it was already there , it is oxidation , etc .	3365
0	terrible experience in the cafe . waitress disappeared the second we walked in . coffee was like jet fuel and undrinkable . we waited and waited and waited . decided to leave and had to wait while cashier seated people -- where is the waitress ? at least we did n't have to pay the coffee . cashier told us it was n't the first time .	3580
1	really enjoyed it . my tip is to get the cheese plate . beautiful presentation and plentiful . also tried the crab cake with apple and arugula . very good . ca n't wait to go back . nice wine by the glass selection too .	286
1	i came in yesterday around 6:30 i got a meatball panini and it was amazing , the thing that made my experience even better was the quality of service i received from everyone there especially the cashier , lynn ? he was so energetic and nice he definitely made me feel welcome . keep up the great work guys ! ! ! 11/10	1161
0	very unhappy . ordered a 2 tired cake with a casino theme and paid $ 130 . we got a two layer cake . cake could not be cut into even pieces . once you cut the frosting the cake was all crumbly . as if the frosted broken pieces together . attempted to contact the unsuccessfully . glad we paid with american express . filed a complaint with american express . they attempted to contact the bakery with no response . america an express refunded us our money . never , ever do business with this bakery . they overcharge , promise to do what you request and then font do it ! ! !	868
1	i have tried almost everything on the menu and the only thing i do not recommend is the quiche . it had more of a custard texture then i am use to . the soup is amazing with strong savory flavors . all the salads are so fresh and flavorful . the sandwiches are mouthwatering ... but the pastries are the best !	1276
0	went to tryst on one of the first nights they opened back in 2010 - have n't been back since ! the $ 20 cover charge is a little much for the mediocre club . i can see what the attraction is for the younger crowd ( 20 year olds ) , as it 's probably their priority to just drink a tonne and get jiggy with each other . i can say that for an older guy ( but not too old ) , this place is n't the greatest . i 'd prefer a nice pub to this over-hyped joint . not the spot for me !	1449
1	love this place ! ! ! ! the decor is perfect ! not too cheesy and not too blah , just right . the staff members are n't too cheerful but they get the job done . and of course , the music is always on point ! the drinks too ! so many 80s themed drinks , i love it ! oh and the arcade is full of awesome retro games !	677
0	1 . food was okay . shrimp temp 2 . it took forever to get out food . 3 . waitress did not check on us at all . 4 . they used to be better than this . i wonder if they have a different cook . disappointed .	895
1	went in for an oil change and was done in 20 minutes , including the tire rotation ! good job guys !	1895
0	first of all , one must wonder why the hell you have to give a review of a grocery store . secondly.. why the hell would a grocery store not accept debit cards ? who writes checks anymore ! ? the prices are higher than walmart to begin with , being as it is , that 's not a reason to only accept cash , check or discover . the store is disorganized and employees rude , so no perk there . they only have a few brands of items so no large selection.. drive the extra mile and go to walmart . you 'll save money , convenience and hassle .	3216
1	good atmosphere , nice staff and menu is really is good so if your looking for cool hang out spot after work or to watch a sporting event this is good place for that .	1520
0	so , i have to update this since my last review because 1 ) i went to vietnam grille on south and 2 ) i tried lang van again . what i had at lang van was oh-so-better at vietnam grille - had more flavor & tasted fresher . also , my companion found a hair in his soup at lv . service was much better this time .	947
1	very good buffalo chicken ceaser salad . first try for this salad , excellent sauce . buffalo chicken pizza was also very tasty . zach the server was excellent as well .	581
0	i had went to this store on march 5 2018 to exchange an item for something else and the manager that is a woman was very disrespectful and literally disrespected me in front of the whole store because i used a coupon on the item that i was trying to exchange and she basically was saying i was stealing . i called her corporate office and hopefully she gets fired i will never go to that store again . she made me feel very uncomfortable and she had no right to say that to me . when i was just trying to get my dog food for my dog .	2108
0	do n't waste you money on this one , i was expecting so much more with the name `` eva longoria '' attached to it , but this was a big disappointment . i like latin flair ... this was just overprice food , rude managers and bad cocktails . the restaurant was pretty and our table had a nice view of the shooting fountain , but i do n't have anything good to say about the restaurant . there is so much fine dining in las vegas like alize at the palms , perfect every time for less than 270.00 . our tab was over 270.00 for two for a dinner that should have been 75.00 .	971
0	bird problems for the past month fresh produce always attracting the birds , their germs and poop galore !	3721
1	i did n't catch the guys name who was working , but every time we come in he 's always so helpful ! we have gotten a few things from this location . they also carry cartons of cigarettes too . he took his time with helping find what we wanted and he was sooooo patient with us too . we did n't feel rushed at all . we will def continue to come back	591
0	i 'm sad to say it was hands down one the worst show i 've ever seen . the titanic sinks and turns into the statue of liberty for some bazaar reason.really bad taste .most of the dancing and singing acts were noticeably not rehearsed enough.the girls were not very attractive . there was one pretty singer who was a strong performer .	3069
1	good bar food . we had buffalo wings and they were ok.burger and fries and pulled pork sandwich were very good . the fries were excellent . happy hour on weekends !	717
0	never . again . i got sns and it took over an hour and a half . only one person there knew how to do sns and he was very inconsiderate and rude . he hurt your skin around the nails with the tool and was very rough . during the process , i started bleeding and afterward my skin stung very bad . my nails did not come out great , the polish is uneven and has marks in it . it was very overpriced and i will never go there again .	3031
1	amazing ! one of the best places i have ever eaten ! got the tamago burger and was beyond satisfied ! juicy , mouth watering , and divine ! the jazz fries were wonderful ! captivatingly scrumptious !	964
1	maaaannn ! ! ! lefty been cutting my hair for about 8 years now . and i 'm proud to see that he has created the classiest and most professional black barbershop in the country . from the entrance to the atmosphere , its no wonder that it 's the best barbershop in town and always packed . i drive all the way from n. scottsdale and even when i lived in vegas whenever i came back to phoenix i made my way out to chandler to get my cut . you playing yourself if you go to another barbershop . this ai n't no game ! this lefty 's !	2467
0	stopped by the store . we had $ 1,000 in a fsa account we needed to spend . we were ignored as other customers , who came in after us , were waited on . after 15 minutes , we decided they must not want our $ 1,000 so we left . lots of paces to buy rx glass ... .no need to be treated like this .	3544
1	so i decided to try red lantern out since i heard they revamped the place . once a dive bar , now a polished modern establishment ! our waitress was named tiffani and she was absolutely wonderful , always checking on us and super prompt ! i ordered the reuben tater tots and the buffalo chicken sandwich , yum to both of them ! the prices are like everyone says pretty high and the menu could be a little bigger which is why i have this place four stars . i ca n't wait to see what they do in a year or so !	1253
0	excellent adult beverages however service sucked and we would of ordered a lot more drinks but our waitress was awful . the waitress we had paid full attention to the men at the table only . she should of realized that women ultimately decide if you go back and what your tip will be . very disappointed	383
0	will not return because management will not accept certain coupons ! and he was very rude ! you 'll know who he is , hes very big .	844
1	i travel to vegas every now and then for business and i love staying here . it 's clean quiet and the staff are so friendly and helpful .	1633
0	words can not describe how gross and depressing this location is . the inside is very dirty and messy behind the counter . if you go in the mornings it is impossible to get timely service and the staff is not presentable at all . the worst was this week when i went through the drive-thru and there was gigantic cockroach crawling all over the window . an employee had to use a spray bottle to scare it away and it crawled back inside the building through a hole in the building wall . i lost my appetite completely and will never be returning .	2347
1	i am emotionally attached to this place.this place has given me food and given me a place to go to early morning 's when all the clubs are closed . : ) the night starts by saying- '' it 's party time '' and eventually ends at giant eagle at times.three cheers for giant eagle ! ! ! now , i have to cheat on you , by going to ralphs in west coast.sigh ... oh , that became more of a letter to giant eagle ( giggles ) .for the note , its a huge grocery store , and it 's close to cmu and upitt . -smriti	3430
1	being a client of active renter property management , i can honestly say that the employees and the company as a whole go above and beyond on a regular basis . they do n't treat their clients like ' a number . ' it is nice to hear that a company cares more about people rather than numbers and income . i recently had an appliance issue that active renter was ready and energetic to help and make sure everything was up and running right away . i will recommend them to any and all of my friends in need of an apartment or house .	843
1	i agree completely with the other three reviewers . dr. berelowitz is a wonderful doctor and his care has been great . i have been seeing him for over a decade , and like lindsay o , i was thrilled when he came back to town . my only complaint is that it is hard to get an appointment .	2143
0	not a place you ever want to go . if its , an emergency god help you . this place is filled with 3rd party contractors that just do n't seem to care . i have seen people and families leave the waiting room after waiting up to 6 hours waiting to see someone . it is a shame . i i ca n't speak for all but most seem to have lost what nursing was to be about .	2503
1	this place have great selection of furniture , electronic and etc . we just bought house in henderson and made huge shopping plan for furniture . 2 bedrooms set , dinning set , office set , sofa set and 2 mattress . sales person `` jason '' . took care of us very well . monday was his days off , but he still came out for our shopping finishing up . we will be back for more furniture for sure .	439
1	had journey electric do a small project for us . we were extremely happy with the work and cost . the electrician was polite , knowledgeable and efficient . i will definitely use them again .	2258
0	the employees did n't quite grasp the concept of an iced coffee . received a hot coffee in a hot cup with a couple of ice cubes in it . no bueno	2397
1	i took my standard poodle in to be groomed . nancy was soooooo nice ! she was very patient with my dog and he really likes her . this is the second time i have brought him to this petsmart and it is because of nancy that we go back . she took the time to listen to exactly what kind of cut we wanted and he looked great when i picked him up !	2649
0	used this company to cater a working lunch for my boss . they bought 5 oz drink glasses and no ice ! really ? this was a working lunch , not a bar crawl . the sandwiches were average , at best . then the deliverer who set the lunch up left a large bag and several boxes right in the conference room . you 'd think for $ 200 they would have carried out their own garbage ! we will not be using this vendor again ! i would rate them and their service as mediocre at best and their delivery services as just bad !	432
1	got up this morning after a long night of food , entertainment , and gambling . i was hungry with a capital h. i decided to give this place a go . i ordered an omlette with tomatoes , green peppers , ham , onions , pepper jack cheese , and mushrooms . white toast and no potatoes . the omlette was very tasty and i enjoyed it very much . this is a nice quick option if you dont have time for room service	1071
0	this store once honored its veterans with a discount daily not just holidays . a cashier informed me that the new management changed its policy . i understand that not all kolhs stores honors its vets daily but why would managment suddenly change ? anyway this store no longer honors it 's veterans ...	3896
0	very unorganized . do n't complete work or communicate with you in a timely fashion . it is not one hour at all ! they blame one another ! it 's a poorly run operation . there are so many other companies . choose another one .	1803
1	great happy hour and service . get the black and bleu burger	428
0	the new owners have ruined the baked goods . the chocolate croissant was good but tasted like it was made with frozen dough . the menu looks good but i did n't try anything but the croissant and caffe mocha . the coffee was excellent . this in top of the owner and chef sitting at a table with a sales rep selling premade pastries and they actually ordered some . i 'll be back for the coffee and sandwiches but not the croissant or baguette	93
1	this chinese restaurant owner is from hawaii , so a lot of the chinese flavor still tastes like it 's from hawaii . when i go here i always have to have their hawaiian crispy gau ghee . they always serve cold ginger chicken . their managua is ok , not like libby 's manapua in hawaii though . eating here gives you that little bit of feeling like you 're back home .	1103
0	note to self photograph every square inch of a car from payless noted mutiple scratches all over car and staff says there is a chip in windshield cant wait to fight this one . this on top of the egregious overcharge ( $ 125 ) they tried to extort when i came in 18 hours early on monday . back to my hertz gold for future saw car go right back out as i left poor sap wonder how many times they will try and charge for that `` chip '' so unnoticable the camera couldnt see it	3595
0	i 've been taking my kids to dr. garcia for 4 years . i ca n't take it anymore . i requested a doctor change with my insurance . the staff is the rudest and laziest i 've ever seen . it gets worse every year . and they charge for everything now . you need a shot record ? $ 10 . your kid is sick and needs to be seen the same day ? extra $ 100 . not to mention when you need a referral that they mess it up every single time . either they request the wrong kind of specialist ( ! ! ! ) or they do n't put in the paperwork at all . i 'm done .	2461
0	overpriced garbage . out of all the smoke shops in the vegas area , this one is the worst ! all of their inventory in cheap chinese knock-off crap . do n't bother with a few good shops within 1 mile !	591
1	michael cordova and his associates handled my case like true professionals . they addressed my concerns and did a great job communicating the pros and cons of my case . although there were cons , there was always a concrete plan of action to move through them . i liked how michael planned out the case and executed on what was promised . it was not a painful experience , like i expected . if you 're looking for one of the good guys , then it is definitely these guys . they performed up to my expectations and ended up winning my case . bravo !	3169
0	if i could give zero stars i would . i bought a used car from this dealer and was told that all of their cars are inspected before selling . i was rear-ended by someone and when my insurance company inspected the damages they found evidence of damage from a prior accident . i called volvo of tempe and spoke to the sales manager and of course he denied knowing about the prior accident . this dealer is very shady . they sold me a dangerous vehicle and wo n't own up to it . do not buy from this place ! ! ! ! i ca n't warn you enough .	525
0	worst customer service ever . thank god i spend my 10k somewhere else . glad they only got $ 250 out of us for my ring . could not care less that we were customers .	2512
0	typical mall with decent shopping for all walks of life . decent food court populated by underdressed/over made-up teenagers . it 's nothing short of a miracle that any of this mall 's kiosks are still open . every person working was either on their cell phone or the internet .	2815
1	i 've been coming here since they opened and have always had a great experience . it 's an authentic , semi-hole in the wall , delicious taco spot . their meat is super tender and delicious , ca n't go wrong with the chicken ! i 'm a huge fan of the taco salad , but the burrito and tacos are prime time . my husband fav part is the byob and liquor store next door . the perfect combo , especially for taco tuesday .	562
0	the seats and aisles are incredibly small and have n't been updated since the 80 's . considering the cost of parking and tickets for a large event like welcome to night vale it 's not really a suitable venue . watching loads of people not being able to sit in the seats properly . the doormen are overly eager to make you toss your drinks hurriedly at the front as carlos said .	1801
1	this is cookie heaven . most notable is their giant chocolate chip cookies which are miraculously always fresh and still warm from the oven no matter what time of day you stop in . also noteworthy is the `` nookie cookie '' , smaller in size , this bite-sized chocolate cookie is covered in icing sugar and is probably what people have in mind when they say woman prefer chocolate to sex ... oh , also they make good sandwiches , soups and salads .	390
0	sometimes it depends sometimes it seems like it 's a nice shop other times i do n't like it at all i believe that their mechanics are not the friendliest people i have no problem with the sales people but that 's about it not a really good selection here they do n't ever have the little parts you need and one of the mechanics tried sending me somewhere else to get a part but there was one mechanic that was okay so like i 'm saying this place can be a hit or miss depending who 's working	1931
0	this review is based on food and drinks . horrible service , mediocre product . if you decline the constant upsells they will ignore you . i 'm sure it will do well due to its location and everyones willingness to support the club . as for the food and drinks so many better places worth exploring . i 'm going to put this in the same category as tao it will be fun to party at ( anticipating ) but better eating elsewhere .	971
0	my prescription was not called into the pharmacy by the end of the day and i had to call the office to remind them . also , i left a message for a medical assistant when i was experiencing some side effects and never received call back . this practice was very good when it was smaller and now that it has grown so quickly , it appears that there are some inter office communication problems . i am not sure that i will be returning .	2099
1	just wanted to write and say , thank you ! ! ! you and your mechanics , once again have demonstrated excellent workmanship on my vehicle . first time you completed the front brake work on my vehicle ( i ordered the parts , trying save $ $ $ ) . i developed a loud brake squeal . after inspecting , you recommended that i use oem brake pads . you ordered and installed the pads . you even worked with me on the cost ( which was my error to begin with ) . everything is working perfectly ! ! ! thanks again ! reggie graham	2041
1	this hotel was very nice . the staff was excellent , the room was clean and spacious ... with a modern look . it has a living area with tv and a separate bed area with tv . the beds were comfy and the bathrooms were very modern .	3253
1	wonderful variety in the beers , constantly refreshed selection , quick responsive staff and some delicious beer/combos make this the best beer bar in toronto . even something as simple as their yam fries is delicate and yummy . a number of beer-infused dishes let you experiment with brewed food flavours . you 'll find something like 35 draft beers on tap , plus dozens more in bottles , so even the most demanding beer connoisseur will find something to satisfy their palate . most highly recommended . the only drawback is that it 's not a large space so it gets crowded quickly , especially since it 's become very popular lately .	3039
1	excellent location , delicious food , and good service ... what else would you like ? ... we had the risotto as an appetizer and the duck and pork chops as main dish ... i still do n't know which one was better ! ! .. the dessert was really good as well and the wine was great ! ... there was not one thing that do not deserve the 5 stars . i think this should be one of the top 5 restaurants in calgary !	437
1	amazing workmanship . im always happy when i leave here and with a juice box .	2181
0	i 've done over 50 escape rooms and this was by far the worst . every game expects you to use a blacklight that does n't stay on . it was beyond frustrating . no one in our party had fun at all . super cool ambiance and set up only for complete disappointment . avoid at all costs , there are so many better and cheaper options .	1391
0	rude . i walked in here last week , the woman at the front desk never acknowledged me . no `` hello , how are you , let me know if you need anything . '' i was browsing for a total of 5 minutes more just to see if she would say something to me ... ..after that amount of time and she still had n't said anything i left because they did n't deserve my money or business ... .	1880
0	very uncomfortable feeling . i went to the mens section to browse some carhartt pants so wanted to try them on just to make sure . was wearing basketball shorts so didnt have a belt . i rang the bell to get a associate to open the dressing room door and was rudely approached by the female and was told to not take the belt inside and then told me to put it back and waited to see me put it back like i was a thief . it may be policy but to make a client feel like they were unwelcome is poor customer service . i shop there a lot . but will definitely seek elsewhere from now on . very disappointed .	2601
0	went to the i phone doctor and my screen fixed everything was ok for about a week and the screen came off went back and they told me sorry but i have to pay again and they would fix the camera part at no charge.shame on me i went to get it fixed and they told me you have to pay again . do n't trust them people they lie .	2342
0	did not receive the correct sectional : ( still waiting to hear from someone on what to do ! spent over 90 minutes on hold . poor customer service all around .	3738
1	justin , sean and the staff always give great customer service ! ! keep up the good work	1237
0	zero stars for this location . horrible first time curbside order assistance . they never deliver curbside , processed my order wrong , charged me the wrong amount , supposedly processed a refund back to my card while canceling an order since they could not adjust the difference . refund has yet to appear on my cc . mind you all this is being handled with the store manager . complete waste of my time !	1555
1	extremely friendly and knowledgeable . great find . will be back . great and friendly customer service is very difficult to come by these days .	3804
0	had a flat and do n't take cars after 5 even though they stay open till 7 . poor customer service	2542
1	move over , cupcakery and nothing bundt cakes ... this is my new favorite dessert place in las vegas ! this places only makes pies ... and lots of different kinds ! their pies are not too sweet , with yummy flaky crusts . they make fruit , cream , meringue , and mini-sized pies . they also make cheesecakes . they are only open from 10am-5pm , and they are closed on sunday . check them out !	2637
0	i want to like this place , but every time there is an issue . today it was fish taco day and despite clearly stating on the menu they come with cabbage , they do n't have any cabbage . i asked why is it on the menu especially since cabbage is standard on fish tacos ... she says oh i had no clue . girl ! really ? honestly the only thing keeping me coming here are the great coupons through the rewards program but the service really sucks ... each and every time i come .	1365
0	dont even waste your time , instead drive away from here ! ! ! ! their cars have too many miles and it stinks and are in bad conditions ! worst part is that they waste your time and dont even sell you what your looking for . they lie on their application and overall are liars ! go to a real car dealership ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	3851
1	mary has been awesome ! she is so friendly , follows up with phone calls , and is very professional . it was about 115 degrees outside and she showed me around to 3 different units in the heat and was very patient with me . on my move in day , i broke a vase outside my unit and it was like 100 degrees . when i asked for a broom to clean it up myself , she was so nice and said she would take care of it . very much appreciated after a 12 hour day of moving ! facility is clean , reasonably priced . if you value good service , i recommend life storage .	3919
1	best pedicure ever along with a lovely staff ! ( it 's like candy ) the tahitian pedicure with the callus eliminator is amazing . my feet have n't been then soft in at least ten years . this is officially part of the annual festivities . thank you carrie !	1606
1	we visited this restaurant in late june 2015 . excellent food ! the grilled chicken barbecue sandwich is awesome . you order at a window , find a seat and they 'll call you when your order is ready . there 's also a large bar with a great beer selection on draft . the place feels relaxed and casual . friendly staff , too .	211
0	way too expensive for very mediocre music and ambience . can find tons of clubs and lounges in the area that are similar , better and cheaper too . only advantage is that it rarely has a long line up !	634
1	amazing food , great bubble tea , friendly service . more importantly , always consistent ! kudos !	784
1	if you are looking for an optometrist that is knowledgeable , professional and friendly look no further ... dr. nguyen is all of the above plus more . my family has frequented the office at the district and always loved the convenience of the location , but the new office in seven hills is beautiful . it 's clean , the staff is knowledgeable and friendly and the overall experience is fantastic . not to mention the best selection in eyewear . if they do n't have it they will find it = ) )	2107
0	went through our home warranty for a washing machine repair . was promised twice for a 1st appointment of the day . the morning of the appointments , they changed the appointment to 10am and noon , with no phones call to notify either time . the second appointment , they promised they would not rearrange the schedule like the first appointment . the scheduling lady called me a liar and said that they never promise 1st appointments . they do not care about customer service . after reviewing yelp , they have a huge problem and do not care about their ratings . unless you are retired and can stay home all day waiting . use someone else .	3885
0	worst customer service ever . o was harassed by the workers here multiple times being called a liar and then not following their own policies	583
0	went here because we saw the great reviews on bloody mary 's and we were staying at the hotel . worst decision ever . maybe it was our bartender but we got two bloody mary 's that tasted like straight tomato juice no vodka in them . returned them and got beers instead	2688
0	played a number of courses in the estrella area . this is by far the worst . dry dead grass , dusty trails and patchy greens . had to take the compressor to clean all the dust out of my bag . quit after 9 holes . cheap but still not worth it .	1138
1	my daughter booked for the both of us to get an hour massage . ruby was the one that gave me a massage . she is really good . she asked me where i wanted her to focus on . i said my upper back and deep tissue . she really really did a good jib . the hour goes by pretty fast . because i checked in thru yelp i got a free foot scrub . i felt so new when i left . the massage was greatly needed	2252
1	i had two pairs of pants altered there -- one hem and the other , a hem and waist intake -- in november . she ( or they ? ) does an excellent job . alterations are never cheap , and i found her prices reasonable . ( i brought my pants to her while visiting from new york , where alterations can be very costly . ) i admired her work on a beautiful velvet men 's jacket that a customer came in to try on and retrieve .	976
0	almost 9 bux for 2 little cups of ice cream with some crap sprinkled over it . the girl working was nice but i could two sh*ts if there is dairy in my ice cream or where the friggin toppings are sourced from . people need to have their heads examined for paying so much for this stuff . there are people in this world that dont have any food , let alone vegan ice cream . if ya wana piss away your money just give it to me . hell , ill even put on a thong and shake my ass for ya ...	3902
0	it 's great to have a resource like this one for people who need temporary equipment , but they could definitely do better with their customer service . i called a few minutes before noon . ( their hours show that they 're open 24 hours , it it 's not accurate ) i tried to explain to the lady who answered the phone , that the hours were not accurate but she was so rude . hope they get their hours update so others will not have the same issue ...	2094
1	i love these guys . i could fall off the face of the earth for months at a time and they 'll remember me each time . the nails they do are amazing and my mom got her hair done here and it was super cute ! i normally come by here to get my eyebrows done because i 'm always coming by when i get off work but this place is great !	2915
1	i love that you can pop into the joint , get in and out and receive excellent care and service . the hours are so convenient and you feel valued as a patient by the reception staff and doctors . i always feel better after a visit to the joint and highly recommend them .	2464
0	new town , new house , new frig from rc willey and it is 11 minutes past the delivery window . no call , crickets . not happy !	439
1	just ate here last night - our 3rd or 4th time . i had the choice sirloin and my wife had the portobello mushroom chicken - both of us loved our meals . our server , taylor , was very nice . highly recommend !	1491
1	been to every arizona taco festival since it first started . good food , good beer , good tequila , and good music ! ! ! ca n't wait until saturday ! ! ! always fun .	1392
0	just read the hidden reviews for this company , and i was not surprised based on my terrible experience . what a joke service . and now i am $ 1600 dollars in the hole for damage they made to my property walking on a tile roof and then breaking it ! ! ! and this damage was confirmed and reported to me by a third party licensed roofing contractor . learn from our experiences and stay far away from this group .	3542
0	my sushi was not able to be eaten with chopsticks ! i ended up eating them with my hands on a side walk because it was falling apart so badly . it was my first time going and i do n't think that i 'd try it again . they also do not have vegas rolls , they charged me for the few orange eggs on top , i forgot the place i normally go to has cream cheese in theirs . the flavor was ok , but again , likely not going back due to the poor construction of it .	24
1	i had to update this old review . we still eat lunch here very often . the food always tastes great ! it is pretty busy and loud at lunch but the food comes fast and hot . it is also a great deal at just over $ 10 for the lunch special , highly recommend .	1123
0	never complained before but decided to treat myself , and left choice to friendly host , specifiaing n o t spicy , got to go go pad thai with shrimp , under the shredded carrot , cilantro , red cabbage was fire hot soggy whatever dug around and ate the shrimp , too afraid to go back .	779
1	during my recent trip to vegas with my husband , we decided to visit azuza for a relaxing night of hookah ! we found this place a very short distance from the strip ! i must say , the customer service was better than any i 've ever experienced at any hookah lounge ( and i 've been to many ) . libby was awesome ! ! ! the atmosphere was intimate , they serve food and alcohol , and the hookah was smooth and perfect the entire time ! they stay on top of refilling drinks and changing out coals , to maintain your excellent smoking experience ! i definitely enjoyed azuza and will be returning when i visit las vegas again !	1229
0	wow this place used to be great the food was delicious and you could tell it was made with care , not the case any more i 'm not sure if it was sold or what but the food is definitely not what it used to.. i tried twice different days different cooks and sad to say but i will need to find a new hole in the wall .	3858
0	1st off it 's pretty pricey for just a sandwich and a drink it was over $ 11 . me and a coworker ordered at the same time and he added a soup and mac and cheese and i got my 1 sandwich 9 minutes after my coworker got his and all he had left was a half sub left . other than that my sub was pretty good . but i wo n't return because of the service .	484
0	i gave this place 3 chances , to be fair . brian did my nails and 1 ) took forever ( 2.5 hours ) because he was dealing with other things like his mother 's personal rent lease , 2 ) calls everyone sweetheart ( learn my name ! ) , and 3 ) brags about his ocd and what a good job he does ( i 've definitely had better ) and the best part , 4 ) he got high just before starting my nails last time ! ! i wo n't be going back .	1333
1	i sure hope my trainer bill crawford at basic training does n't follow my reviews ! i know i should n't be eating bundt cakes but i do n't care ! these cakes are so moist and scrumptious there is nothing like them ! i recently had the blueberry one and it was really tasty . my favorite is red velvet it is rich and has cream cheesy icing on top . seriously , if you need to impress , thank or present someone with the best cake ever ... this is the place ! i wish i had a wedge now !	18
1	i was in town for the weekend visiting my friends at the university of pittsburgh when i realized i had a slow leak in my tire . the guys at pep boys took my car and had the tire patched within an hour . overall a quick , affordable , and seamless experience - no complaints !	3020
0	warning : just had what be my worst bar experience ever ! upon entering this sergakis the slumlord owned establishment i was greated by an agressive ratfaced man who insinuated that i probably had alcohol in my backpack . then i noticed that this $ hithole smelled like what can only be described as `` fart water '' ! do n't go here under any circumstances !	574
1	best tacos . highly recommended and i would definitely go again . great tacos and good variety .	270
1	i purchased almost $ 8000 in furniture recently for our new home . i was happy with all phases of sales , product for the price and the return policy . i would definitely shop here again and wish we had this furniture store in denver as well !	2071
1	huge fan of my gel manicure , which was done in thirty minutes and cost me $ 25 without tip . do n't expect a super long hand massage for this price , but if what you want is a quality manicure from a clean facility , head to vy 's !	3732
1	amazing donuts with lots of variety ! jack frost and brewnuts get a lot of press ( and for good reason ) , but bigmouth 's cake and yeast donuts are better ! their original location on e. 55th is in a great space as it has lots of seating and fun decor . it is also connected to the goldhorn brewery that has quality beer and a fun setup with a pool table , darts , board games , outside patio , and parking .	1643
1	our waitress jessica , was sweet and very attentive . the food we ordered we hot and very good . francine c el paso	325
1	one of the best places i have lived by far . would absolutely recommend to fellow people i know moving to nevada .	3515
1	al did a great job . my tree looks awesome ! the price was competitive and the quality of work was superb . i will use core tree for all my future jobs : )	334
1	hired them to move the big stuff from upstairs to my garage - extremely friendly , professional and helpful . dennis & zac were wonderful ! thank you so much !	2603
0	this zoo is depressing . the animals looked sad and stressed and like they would rather be dead than kept in this zoo . the enclosures are tiny and not fitting to the needs of the animals nor were they clean . it 's great that the goats get to be played with , but they could easily escape their enclosure and there was poop everywhere . this zoo is sad and should either make people pay to make it better for the animals or shut it down ! ! animals have feelings too ! ! ! # animallivesmatter	3786
1	one of the better vx experiences as the check-in and gate agents are as chill as other vx elsewhere in the system , while the e gates are just outside security , which saves you from a tram ride and long additional walk to the remote gates and terminals . now that vx is fully merged into as as of this past week , here 's hoping they keep the best of both airlines . rip , virgin .	1623
0	purchased the groupon deal but the website is no longer working and been calling and texting there business phone number nobody 's answering as well , i assumed this place is now closed ! please dont purchased the deal , money wasted .	3685
0	ehhh . i agree with the lower reviews . the people were really nice but my pad thai chicken should not have been pink ! did n't quite have that pad thai taste i was looking for . the restaurant was dingy and decor was underwhelming . 2.5 for the service and quick cook time .	1203
0	their seasonal taco salad was a joke , the chicken was all dried out and it was just clunky and difficult to eat , because they put whole tortilla chips in it which are difficult to manage in a salad ( served on a plate ) . the flavour was nothing spectacular , and when combined with the dry tiny chicken cubes it was like a 4/10 . other than that the other meals i saw at the table looked decent.the service was bad , they were too busy , but should have anticipated that .	1569
0	this was my first visit to this location . the facility is excellent very clean and very welcoming . the woman that met us when we came in and helped us fill out the paperwork was very professional kind and caring . the nurse was very helpful . we were the only ones there . the doctor sat on his lazy ass for over 30 minutes before seeing us . nothing urgent about this place and be prepared to spend close to $ 2,000 when they finish your billings .	3698
1	this store has friendly staff and are very knowledgeable staff is young the stores open till i think 9 o'clock and they do n't mind going the extra mile i work personally with a young lady by the name of giselle she has gone above and beyond for me on several occasions explaining the phones functionality vs the products i think compared to the store is busy most of the time but it has easy access , close to the freeway as well there 's no wait line like there is a very corporate stores	2166
1	good spot for a couple of drinks and tapas plates before going to the centaur . website needs work . bilingual would help for tourists . intend to return for dinner some night . how about a happy hour ? lots of other old montreal restaurants offer this option fir the end of work day and pre theatre crowd ? staff were friendly and helpful . owner needs to smile and engage with customers .	1167
0	first not really good for kids , no boaster sits or high chair . this was my second time coming and it will be my last . i do n't know if they are under new management or if they have a new cook but the food does n't taste the same as it did before . it was under seasoned almost plan and i ordered the hot and spicy seafood ramen . it was a little spicy but the flavor of the ramen has gone down a lot , very disappointing .	812
0	slow service ! it would be really fun if the people working here gave a shit about their job	3581
0	why are all the employees unpleasantly stressed out here ? try not to get too excited and ask a lot of questions . clearly , they do n't want to chat.. also do n't bother trying to pay with anything higher than a $ 20 bill , because they wo n't take it . the `` manager '' ( who must be such a dread to contact ) must have missed an entire section on problem solving , especially for instances such as this . the cashier did n't know what to do or say . it seems this happens pretty frequently . : /	3943
1	great food and tons of beer options . a must stop . the service was first rate and great music .	957
0	foodwise , the place is adequate . the hot food comes out `` hot '' and i liked the seafood and noodles soup . their rolls and other sushi is standard ayce mediocre stuff ... .the rice was very poor . the service was also pretty bad . the main problem is the lack of a good system of getting the right food to the table ... .i thought the staff were at least trying , but the overall result was chaotic . i do n't need or like chaos when i eat .	1049
0	horrible concession lines . stood in line for 40 minutes for a water . missed entire second act . horrible system ! never be back . pouring a can of beer or water into a plastic cup and creating more garbage and adding to your wait . ridiculous !	2187
0	is this business here to sell to their customers or their employees and friends ? i bought a gift card for my girlfriends birthday and the purse she wants was being held for an employee . it would seem to me that your priority as a business should be service and satisfaction of the customer in hopes of repeat business . they have accomplished the opposite with this couple and if it were n't for their no refunds on gift cards we would take our money to a place that sells to customers .	1446
0	so disappointed smh i over heard the techs talking bad about the people in the treatment rooms . i wonder what they say about me . all i know is the manager is cold and rude and these woman are so fake , and also very disrespectful . plus my treatments so so .	343
1	i 've been coming to this salon for the last few years and i must say that i 've never been disappointed ! i had a different stylist every time and they 've all done a great job . today i got a cut from saki and it 's really superb ( much better than my last cut at an expensive high end salon , by the way ) . and at $ 35 ( including wash ) , what not to like ? !	2181
0	rude service people . overpriced food . was a waste of my time and money . they took forever and had no organization with their orders .	2937
0	ok , the pho was not bad tasting at all . it was actually ok however 2 hours after i ate it i experienced dizziness and got nauseated and ill ! i threw up all the food that i ate from that place . i do not now what that happened but it happened to me . the food was not bad and the waiter barely understood english . i can not recommend this place after it made me so ill . i do not wish it on anyone . be warned .	673
1	always professional and loving . wesley is amazing and my baby girl cocker spaniel loves her to death . trustworthy and very reasonable prices .	3779
0	not happy . changed dermatologists , asked that all records be transferred . much room for improvement in the services rendered .	2099
0	terrible , terrible service , if i could give them less than one star i would . they were contractually obligated to drop my daughter and 9 of her friends at a prearranged point after their prom , but the driver drove them to another location and proceeded to try and extort $ 150.00 cash from them in exchange for driving them to the correct house . they refused - as they had no cash on them - so he left them at the wrong place , in the dark , at 11:30 at night . when i expressed my displeasure via a message to their facebook page , they responded with profanity and abuse . do not use this compa	2578
1	( 4.5 stars ) i love dim sum so i decided to give emerald a try , and boy was i sure glad i did ! i came here for breakfast a few times , and always came out happy . i also came here for dinner a few times . ( i hope this tells you just how much i love dim sum lol ) the crispy squid was delicious , crispy , hot , yummilicious ... . and the roast duck was absolutely delicious ! will definitely come here again ! : )	0
0	i do not give 1 star reviews lightly , but this business is beyond unprofessional . their business practices seem to change with the mood of the owner , and it is the customers who suffer .	3000
1	great coffe , great breakfast bagel . what 's more to say . service was quick . will be back ! yum yum !	1214
0	checked this place out recently but was pretty disappointed . it smelled like old people in there . the ceiling and carpet was seriously out dated , like 1970 's outdated . just had an old/worn vibe , so we did n't stay . the lane area looks ok , but they should dim some of the lighting a bit , and add a few more black lights and remodel the whole interior .	3296
1	had to have my ducati towed and i know many companies do n't want to do that or do n't know what they are doing . mitchell 's sent their driver out who was right on time , extremely courteous and knew exactly what he was doing . ca n't recommend them enough	2678
1	great time on a friday date night with the wife . they played great music from 70's-90 's . they had a guitar musician that brought the house down ! our server said it was the first time she had heard him . they played sweet child o mine to perfection . top notch musician . we plan on going back !	1176
1	bisnou , the long-time nepalese server/manager here is the sh*t. super friendly . he 'll even throw in a freebie here and there , when it 's passed the busy hour . their $ drink specials are great and you 're always guaranteed a decent chat with bisnou if he 's around .	3636
1	best dental experience i have had in a long time . dr. mcdonald was very gentle and understanding . explained everything that was needed , and how soon it was need . cheryl did my cleaning and my teeth do feel so much better . i normally do not look forward to going to the dentist , but this will definitely be my new office .	2054
1	just went in to the store today and was greeted by vicki and samantha , very nice ladies ! i needed help find a dress to wear to an upcoming quincanera . samantha helped me not only find 1 but 3 dresses ! best part is i had a savings of over $ 500 on three dress that happened to be on special ! would definitely recommend this place to friends and family and will be coming back for future special occasion dresses !	1298
0	except samosa nothing tastes good . ordered biriyani and it tasted like tomato rice . chicken was not fully cooked . the quality of food is bad . and no i do n't recommend this place	505
0	i just came in to this salon to get a fill on my nails ; now i remember why i have n't been coming here all along . literally 3 minutes from my house yet i do n't come here usually . walked in , `` walk-ins welcome '' , but i was never greeted . no one even said hello ! it was hot as though the ac was n't on ; it 's 100 degrees today , and i just finally got fed up and walked out . lesson re-learned , i will not be back . ps , nail color selection appeared quite limited .	3732
1	i was looking to get an oil change and i came across these guys . the guys that change my oil were so fast and friendly.the guys had a great sense of humor and extremely polite and helpful . oil change took about 15 mins . i highly recommend this place ! i will be returning again .	2544
0	it does not worth the money . thirty-five dollars for twenty minutes hair cut and it turns out to be ten dollies quality . if you do n't use detailed trimmer , then do your work carefully . do n't excuse that you cut the hair equal length and the issue is that my head is not even！ i felt weak sense of responsibility of you and i felt sorry that you try to pass the buck . definitely not recommend .	3486
1	stopped in today for the first time . had a terrific breakfast along with great , friendly service . will be back !	1499
0	oh boy , what a disappointment ! we got a special from travelzoo . now i know why it was a special ! you get what you pay for ! this place is privately owned and operated by a management co. do n't expect to have valet , room service , a working television in the bedroom , & water in the vending machines . do expect to have hard beds with bed bugs ! ! if you like mediocre lodging then this place is for you !	3916
1	my old boss got me hooked on bare escentuals , so i come here to empty my wallet , i mean stock up ! love that stuff , finding makeup as a redhead is so impossible , but that stuff looks good ! last time i got my brows done while i was here , a bit more spendy than other places in town but they did a really good job and it did not hurt , which is a plus !	2479
0	absolute worst experience i 've ever had . very unprofessional . they messed up my tag . it was suppose to be a weighted tag and then they could n't even get it right when they tried to fix it . they also lost my spare key ? asked for them to mail it to me repeatedly but it never happened . very aggressive selling techniques . they just would not take no as an answer .	2717
0	you 'll never do any business when you do n't say hi/greet the customers or give any kind of acknowledgement . two employees standing around not helping anyone at the front ca n't even say hi to their customers as they walk in or offer advice or help with their shopping needs . i even walked by one of the employees 3 times and not once did she say a word to me . i will gladly take my business somewhere that wants to help me .	3725
1	unique spin on mexico flavors and some evil good jerk wigs . now that their new location is open , they 've had some typical growing pains learning to service a full dinning room ( they previously only had 4-5 tables and a patio ) , but i expect it to pick up . the expanded menu at the new location is a great blend of cheap eats ( taco 's etc . ) and unique finds ( goat curry ) . be sure to make a reservation as it gets packed and byob , so bring along a few of your favorite brews .	1358
0	this is the only grocery store that i have ever been in that did not have garlic and runs out the same needed products each month . walmart does not order its products by customers demand . their pharmacy also runs out of medicines that are critical to their customers survival and do not establish a personal relationship with their customers . it is hope that their new store that is to open on blue diamond does better .	2443
0	i have gone in there many times , convenient since i work close and quality of fish is good ! walked in 5 minutes before opening time and they both looked at me and said we are not open ... .. wtf kind of service is this every time i go in there the 3500 square foot place is dead i 'm the only one in there and if you do n't want to serve your clients , lock the door ! this is embarrassing this place will be shut down soon	129
0	not a fan at all . the chicken smelt like it was cooked in old oil . i 've heard from other people to not eat here.. definitely wo n't again .	895
1	cheap beers , decent pub food , a great place to meet up with friends . surprise : a coffee , small cheesecake , and a chocolate mouse for only 6 $ ! always a good bet for friday drinks .	670
0	loud music from bar behind the hotel . the hotel is nice i stayed an entire week while on business in phoenix . however on wednesday and thursday i had zero sleep due to the loud music from a bar behind the hotel . my white noise machine could n't even drown that horrible sound out . i understand the hotel has no control , but i had zero warning and i was n't even offered ear plugs when i called the front desk to inquire about the noise . i will never stay at this property again and if you value sleep from wednesday through saturday i would recommend you stay elsewhere or bring your ear plugs .	3859
1	great shop . steven was professional and super nice . quick and easy ! was n't very busy so i was able to walk in & out in a short time	3464
1	we walked in to get a dining room table and the one we previously had our eye on had a special going on so we snatched that up . service was very helpful and quick since we had limited time and delivery was easy and fast and very friendly .	3738
1	this place had a cute vibe and delicious food . the portion sizes were normal . i went on a friday night and had no issues getting in . the service was great . no complaints here !	1458
1	superb dining experience ! excellent food and wonderful service . chad and david treated us like royalty on a recent visit . i highly recommend beso for anyone who craves delicious food ( steak or otherwise ) and outstanding customer service with an elegant , classy , yet sexy vibe . i will definitely be dining at beso on my next las vegas trip ! !	971
0	be careful , this place is way over priced . i was quoted $ 89 for a watch battery and went downstairs to the high end watch place tourneau and they did it for	3533
0	our normal pet groomer is on vacation so we reached out to a place nearby . we took our 6lb yorkie there today . after a few times of him crying when we picked him up we started inspecting him . he was cut so short under the arms it was raw and bright red . we will never go there again and i will be calling management in the morning .	3615
1	dr. cunningham and his staff may look like a bunch of ants at work - quickly . that would be such a misconception ! dr cunningham* has save my life . dr cunningham and the amazing kim titus are the best advocates a patient could dream of ! that 's the short version of my gushing about them . the staff is 5 star ! i could not be happier with his office ! *dr cunningham and a staff of what seemed like thousands , hospitals , specialists , etc .	2303
1	fries and gravy were fantastic ! had the fresh made homeburger and it was very good . it was a large patty and not too thick , cooked just right . at $ 4.50 that 's a pretty hard deal to beat . service was great , was greeted on the way in and thanked on the way out . they have a counter with stools inside and a few tables outside . will definitely come back .	652
0	this is a pretty decent movie theatre nothing special . $ 5 mondays is good and $ 22 tuesdays and fridays are cool . but playing uncensored rap music in the lobby and no designated line for buying tickets is dumb . and the people who are in charge of keeping the theatre clean do a pretty shitty job . trash and popcorn was all over the floor ... . are you kidding me .	491
0	no star is what this self serving mess is ! why would harrah 's rewrite a classic show ? original was much better as this is now a show about a mythical girl named jubilee that is hard to follow because of a script being so bad . meaningless music and a bunch of jumping around with fewer topless women than the original . very bad ! ! ! walked out ! this will not run long . would anyone rewrite a classic ? why this mombo jombo ? ? ? a mess avoid this and go to a nice dinner instead . bad bad bad ! ! ! !	3069
0	sometimes service is overrated here . slow , slow , slow . like 4 hours to get my hair done . absurd ? yes . who has that kind of time to spend . gouged my time , and my wallet . no thanks .	1435
1	ayce sunday brunch with our two daughters and a bottle pinot grigio . spectacular as always . i love having the mini mango salad as a palate cleanser between courses . appetizers like goyza , tuna pizza , tempura chicken satay , lemon grass soup are all standard but arrive quickly and hot . sushi for a second course great maki speciality rolls available , i enjoy the rainbow roll with a spicy tuna hand roll while others enjoyed some veg california rolls . on to main course speciality items such a curry dishes , mixed grill and the usual favourites try the thai basil fish or beef . their bangkok street style pad thai is really good .	1362
1	blowfish bbq is an amazing food truck . their drumsticks and mac and cheese are crazy good . i first experienced them at weather permitting . i felt their portions were great . some food trucks leave me wanting more . i had a drumstick , mac and cheese , and slaw . each item was crazy good . the drumsticks are a dry rub , but they also have some liquid sauces for people who want some sauce . i used the spicy sauce on the mac and cheese and it was perfect .	3925
1	my whole family enjoys a good slice o ' pie from jesse 's . we used to live close by , so often it was our friday supper eaten during our movie night . i 've been craving it ( along with their soft , delicious garlic knots ) , so i think i 'll be making the special trip for a fix . love supporting this local business !	1399
0	i never give a low review but seriously the customer service at this location is beyond terrible . i have gone to goodyear in las vegas for almost a decade and usually go to the sahara location but for convenie ce this time came to this location . this will be my last time coming here . the guys working the front desk are rude and speak to you as if you are just a number . the work is good and the prices are too but for the customer service to be this bad i will never come back .	2392
1	5 stars love this place very professional and affordable love the girls they take there time always make me feel amazing , and they genuinely appreciate your business . eyelash extension look awesome , feel great and last a long time highly recommend try it you will love them .	3368
0	just average -- thai food should really zing ... . lots of flavourful ingredients mean that it should have depth and freshness . this place is far too tame , too sweet and not great . pad thai - the signature dish of every thai restaurant - should be their best thing . here the noodles are too sticky and over done , there is the sweetness of peanut butter in there , and only a few shrimp . portion sizes are too small for the price and the service is middling . i would n't go again	1439
0	tonight 13:50 minutes to get a drink and i think three people are playing . you need to bring a drink if you play here . amazing i got yelled at for taking a picture but poor service is ok .	3630
0	took my mother several times and we are both completely dissatisfied with how non-compassionate and non-engaging the doctors she had were . one particular dr. just looked at her laptop computer the whole time while assessing my mothers illnesses . another dr. actually told my mom to 'deal with it ' when it came to her illnesses . staff did n't send multiple referrals to other specialists as promised . this place is an absolute nightmare .	3349
0	i will amend my statement to say they `` tried '' to over charge me by charging `` master stylist '' price for someone who was not deemed a master stylist by them . when i questioned it they amended the charge . they have been harassing me via phone and email to amend my review which i think is ridiculous . they called my home and complained to my mother of all people to persuade me to remove the poor review . not very professional and further solidifying my original perception .	1617
1	a decent chicken sandwich . still miss flo 's chinese here at sky harbor though . bla bla bla more text required .	669
0	i am active duty military and have been out of the country for over a month now ... i went in weeks before i was due to leave to fill out the necessary paper work to have my account disabled ... even though this was completed in plenty of time ... i was still billed this past month for my membership that was supposed to be disabled ! i have since then contacted them twice via email to have this issue resolved with no response as of yet ( it 's been two weeks ) ... do not support this place of business ! this is not how you treat veterans or do business !	3862
0	my first time facial and waxing experience was extremely unsatisfactory . i got herbal facial and i was left to wash the mask my self . after the wax they did not wipe the sticky leftover stuff and neither applied any cooling gel or oil . this would be my first and the last visit here . even though the ladies were nice but service was unsatisfactory .	2077
0	my wife and son are picking up his car at ewing bros right now because he had gotten into a car accident a few days ago . apparently the lady there is ripping them off and saying she did not know the car was not drivable so they are charging extra . are you really that ignorant lady ? it does n't take a genius to see that it 's completely totalled ! furthemore , they are absolutely rude . they remind me of stoneridge towing in hawaii . they all should be shut down ! mahalo for allowing me to warn more people about your work ethics .	3654
1	this store is a reason to get into any sport just to play with the cool stuff.i am a n avid cyclist and they have quality equipment , i have learned you get what you pay for , and it is true here.the store is very well laid out and the staff is very friendly and helpful.i spent $ 300 dollars and had to leave before i went broke , too much cool stuff .	1059
1	my wife and i are regulars here . to be clear , this is not a grocery ! all the better though , as it 's a great environment for one of several things : a ) eating a delectable dinner , lunch , or brunch ; b ) casually enjoying wine , beer , or coffee ( the french press coffee is my favorite ) ; c ) enjoying some of the most exquisite deserts you 'll find in phoenix . the staff are extremely friendly . the decor is very minimalist , but in quite a positive way : unlike other like establishments , there is no air of pretension at french grocery . five stars -- this place is a gem .	1160
1	az science center is great for kids and fun its good for ages 5-11 it has great activities and i have no problem with it	3891
0	you are not an honest businessman joe in my opinion you are a liar you are a joker and i highly doubt you have 130 customers because if you did you would n't have a brokedown truck all the time you would have money to buy yourself a new one so who 's the liar . i highly doubt your customers are very satisfied with you with all your excuses you make on why you ca n't clean their pools . you were fired because you were flaky and you never showed up in my pool turn green . and you never had to wait for your payment you were paid every month on time .	598
1	ordered flowers for a wedding just one week before the date . the finished bouquets were amazing ... . far better than i could have imagined ! price was a great surprise too ... do n't pass this place by - the baskets out front are gorgeous because of the experience behind this business ! !	2281
0	why in the world are the shelves always half full on a good day ? it never fails that i walk in to this extremely small target and ca n't find more than half of what i 'm looking for . please get it together .	2111
1	best corn shower ever . the flavor profile was phenomenal and each spoonful just kept getting better and better . i could eat this by the gallon ! !	59
1	a young man named ivan made my visit a great experience . he was quick yet patient , making sure as we went everything was coming out on time and fresh from cooks . he would definitely be a reason i would return . the communication between front line and cooks was phenomenal ! i got half/half noodle/rice , bejeeng beef , orange & sweet fire chicken , veggie egg rolls and cream cheese puffs . food all tasted great and for such a good price ! please do n't change a thing at this location and give ivan a raise , he has leadership potential .	1342
1	we found this place on our travels the day before and thought that it would be a great place to try for breakfast . and it was delicious . the cafe au lait was wonderful , recommend getting the 'bowl ' if you are a coffee fan . it 's worth the treat . we both got eggs with quinoa that was prepared better than most . the fruit that came on the side was fresh . it 's definitely worth going back to for breakfast or maybe lunch .	243
0	wasted my gas twice at this grimy ass place to be told my vein was not big enough to just drive a couple blocks and donate with no issue . this the last time i waste my gas . they can keep their 20 bucks . i feel bad for the people that depend on our donations .	1753
0	very bad experience here too . be careful at this place ! they charge you way too much . i did the service in another dealer at 1/5th of the price they wanted to charge me .	2997
1	store offering is amazing . really nice people . seem to care about the community . most of all , dress my kids for all occasions and i save money for their eduction and sports .	2018
1	the atmosphere was cozy & romantic here . i like getting away from the strip , yet often that means it 's hard to find the same quality . the sushi was excellent and the service spot on .	408
1	the staff is friendly and i love the atmosphere ! most importantly though , they provide excellent hair cuts ! i 've had 3 different stylists in the 5 or so years i 've been going there and every one of them were great ( haircuts and stylists : ) ! )	2292
0	first subway i 've ever been to that does n't offer salads . every other one i 've been to you can order their sandwiches into a salad . lady behind counter was very rude and said `` just pick a bread '' hardly could understand her . eat fit huh subway ? well not offering an alternative to bread is not eating fit !	870
1	love love love this store ! ! ! such a wide variety of stuff and a huge selection of back issues ! ! ! aaa++++++++	3681
1	toronto finally has a true high-quality gym . i was previously a member of equinox in new york and the toronto location is as nice as any . here 's hoping it does well ...	757
1	great place , have gone a couple of times now and i always get acrylic nails which last about 3-4 weeks . the employees are very quiet but are fast and efficient . they have a great variety of colours for nail polishes and give a free massage too !	2148
1	i recently visited to have a headlight bulb exchanged . the customer service was excellent . the employee had my new headlight bulb installed in 5 minutes for free . although i did tip him $ 10 for the job well done . great store with nice , helpful employees .	3834
1	great shop with lots of experienced barbers and cool environment and designs . they sell cool hats `` royal one '' and also suavecito hair product . they have a tv in the waiting room and magazines . also graffiti on the walls that looks dope .	3469
0	food was ok and the decor is a little douche bag central- it is a `` supper club '' so ... staff were all indifferent airheads- i really did n't like any of the staff i encountered there . food is pretty good and they 're trying to push this thing called the social app- basically they are over priced appetizers . we ( 2 of us ) ordered a bunch of these social apps at the server 's encouragement and paid like $ 200 and left hungry . buh bye	634
1	friendly staff . . all except for one ... the looks like he do n't give a ... . is ironic how the red shirt `` rockys `` are so nice ... ..	2502
0	just okay . thankfully we came here with a groupon because i do n't think we 'll be coming back . nothing impressive .	563
0	had them come out to the annul service on our units . all the guy did was try to up sell me . he did n't even change out our air filters which i consider basic service . to top it off , one of our units stopped working 3 weeks later . coincidence ?	1803
1	if i had known how magnificent their chocolate milkshakes are , i would 've came in to eat a burger , but so so stuffed . i say it is top 3 for a non-malted milkshake . great atmosphere . and gorgeous service too . amex good .	1417
1	great service from frank and kevin ! thanks guys , i really appreciate what you 've done ! nova days finding a combination of a high level professionalism and great customer service skills is rare ! !	959
0	i dropped my wedding dress off to get hemmed on may 4th . she said it would be done on may 15th . i went and she said she did n't get to it yet and to come back in a week . it is now june 2nd and it is still not ready and promised to be done by tomorrow . at least , i brought my dress in with plenty of time . however , if you would like your garments back at a reasonable time or except her to follow through with promises , go elsewhere . every time i stop by , she is telling another client to come back because she is n't done .	402
0	can i give negative stars to this place ? these people are rude ! my husband and i were planning to have dinner there and as we entered , we noticed it was empty except for a couple that w and s eating there . the waitress came up to us and asked if we had a reservation ( we did n't ) and she asked us to leave ... . like wtf ? it was as empty ! ! ! ! whatever ... well , we will definitely never be customers .	285
1	excellent ! i love this place . i had no idea what to expect when i first walked into jung 's . i was wide-eyed and naive ... trying to plant a veggie garden for the first time . the gals at the front pointed my boyfriend and i toward the back where we could find what we were looking for . afterward , we had so many questions ! ! the gal at the front happily told us everything we could possibly want to know about growing a vegetable garden . she also gave us some good tips on how to get these growing healthy and strong . i definitely give this place two thumbs up ! ! : )	3612
1	i prefer coffee bean & tea leaf 's process for making frozen coffee . the flavor and texture are better . my first time at a cb & tl happened because i was too far from another chain ... i have n't had the other chain 's coffee since . i like the ambiance in their shops . i like that they are n't `` in your face '' with their marketing . i also love their winter tea . i can not recall the name of it at the moment , but it 's divine .	2204
0	i would come here every single day to place a bet on sportsbook , but now they charge $ 50 for parking just to go place a bet ! ! ! ! ! really ? i am really disappointed !	2271
0	so first off..i normally love ulta ! i had never been to this location since i live up near summerlin but i was on this side of town and had some time to waste . no one welcomed me when i walked in the door so right away i did n't feel comfortable . i browsed around for half an hour and never , not even once did any associate say hi to me or ask if i needed any help ! customers were the only ones saying hi to me . after 30 min of associates just walking past me not saying hi , offering assistance , or even looking at me i decided to leave . worst experience ever at an ulta store ...	2479
0	we went sunday for the produce . the strawberries were rotten and the tomatoes looked like the fell off the back of the truck before being put out . never again . avoid at all costs	433
1	i do like this place a lot better then the big box stores . very helpful and friendly here . i do volunteer work at an animal rescue around the corner and the folk 's here have been very supportive whenever i 've had a need .	2697
0	on of the worst places i have ever been ! if you do n't get a confirmation e-mail then your appointment was never made . why would they make that an option on their site ? wasted 30 minutes to find out that i did n't have an appointment even though one was scheduled and i waited for the 15 minute grace period . car showed up 10 after and i was out . do n't waste your time	2552
1	donny the shuttle driver is the only plus ... . okay place if you 're on a budget inconvenient was my issue along with the hard sell on insurance get it fight guys with a little more organization you could be as good as everyone else	3576
0	do not have their stuff together , very unprofessional ... waited almost a hour in the waiting room and nothing was getting done . will never go to this fast med again .	2940
0	cvs is a convenient place to stop both for prescriptions and the odd household item . everything from holiday decorations to rx . this location is close to our house , so we are in here three or four times a week . the employees have been both helpful and friendly which make it easy . one tip i would offer is to sign up for their frequent shopper 's program . it 's pretty easy to do and you automatically get discounts on items at the register . nice !	3583
0	really yelpers ? i was super disappointed with az donut co . yes i went at about 9:30 pm , so maybe that affected the deliciousness of these donuts , but overall there was very little deliciousness to be had . i tried the banana cream donut and it was weird ... artificial ... in flavor , greasy , and unpleasant . my friend also had a donut and said it was n't even as good as dunkin . i had coffee , which was nothing special . i would not return , there are better donut establishments in town .	3137
0	we are here right now and will never be back . we always come here and usually enjoy everything but not tonight . the bartender would not serve my moms friend who is 30 because she thinks he is messed up . he is actually really shy and always talks different . before we came here he had one margarita at azteca across the street . this was really prejudice because he is not drunk and i ordered a drink and was n't even id'ed and i 'm only 21 . we will never be coming here again . the bartender is rude and there is a reason this place has shitty reviews .	201
0	i admit that i have never used this company 's services , but i have been cold called by them a few times and i am not the do not call list . any company that is willing to blatantly break the law in one manner may do it again in another . btw , i have asked to be removed from their list every time they call and it never seems to take .	2730
0	the store was really good but the restaurant was terrible , the food and the service were awful . i found a hair in my coffee and on my breakfast plate .	2021
0	the woman totally screwed up my eyebrow took half of it off , then penciled it in . i am so angry and now have to go get a brow pencil to draw in what is gone . do not recommend .	3117
1	love this place and very clean , their dough is just right ! never stale and staff is always friendly/accommodating . one thing i do wish they had was high chairs . when my family comes here we like to sit and eat . my 1 year old ends up having to sit in my lap because he ca n't reach the table in a regular chair .	3322
0	do not go here . this was the worst hair experience i have ever had . the stylist didnt listen to anything i wanted , and gave me what she called `` big texas hair '' because despite what i said i wanted , that was the best look for me . do not go here ! ! ! christina should have her license revoked ! absolutely awful ! ! ! ! ! ! !	2806
1	i love this hotel this is one of my favorite places to stay the staff is really friendly and very nice . they 're also very helpful the food is a little on the expensive side but if you go directly across the street they have a a few little places to eat like salsarita 's , jersey mike 's , a pizza place and a home cooking restaurant . i like the bed they are cozy clean sheets clean bathroom nice fluffy towels i have nothing bad to say about this hotel it 's always usually crowded with people coming and going but i like it a lot.i will keep coming back here	1348
1	i 've been a patient here for 3years and then my dr left , i was n't too sure about staying at wfp until i met gayle milek . gayle is a np who is definitely skilled . she takes her time to explain things to you and does n't talk over you , with medical words that i do n't understand . since i 've seen her , my blood sugars have been better than ever . i finally have more energy and feel like i 'm on the right track .	3349
1	such an amazing experience ! we arrived early and were waiting in line until the shelter opened when we found our new edition as volunteer laura was taking her out for a few hours . laura volunteered to drive her to our house in chandler to meet our other dog . she brought the adoption papers and even set the dog up at a closer shelter for her spay surgery . she was amazing to work with and it such a great experience adding our newest addition to our family !	3626
1	i would recommend flowers by renee to everyone ! i went in there for my wifes and my 20th wedding anniversary , the day of , and the made a great arrangement for me while i waited . the price was incredibly reasonable . great customer service and great prices ! what else would you want ! ! ! thanks flowers by renee !	3622
0	the large pizza used to be $ 5.99 now they 've gone to $ 8.49 and tried to get third party people like grubhub to sell it now i hear they 're closed monday and tuesday that 's 30 % of the week are they on the verge of going out of business ? you do n't close up 2 days a week if you 're doing well you simply hire more people	1399
1	great half price breakfast specials . tia the bartender is so personable . we love going there .	1520
1	went today and got the tempura shrimp and salmon burrito it was soooo good as the food always is ! ! ! !	1354
1	lovely food . i am also happy to eat at this location of paradise bakery.. they have fresh ingredients and make good alterations if asked for . great for vegetarians and well as non vegetarians . fact that this location is in tempe marketplace , makes a high difference so we can enjoy outdoor seating in evenings .	701
1	flew allegiant for the first time to attend a work conference . i really have no complaints . the staff was friendly , the flight was on time and there were no issues . i was glad to have a non-stop option to my destination . i would definitely fly allegiant again .	3127
1	ordered a supreme pizza with 20 buffalo wings for takeout . it was very good and ready in 20 minutes ! ! !	328
1	customer service finally answered my questions . good devices - still not compatible with mac but overall pretty good .	2131
1	great hotel room is awesome with small kitchenette flat screen tv and cable the only downside was when i checked in the room was really hot because the ac was not on but other than that i love this place and they have hot breakfast waffles pancakes eggs oatmeal cereal biscuits and gravy all delicious	1412
1	you cant beat southern cal foot massage prices ( 1hr for 15 bucks ) but this is probably as cheap as it gets in vegas 1 hr foot massage for 35 bucks . it was a comfortable relaxing environment .	2970
1	great service ! we usually get the drinks and ice cream ! i like also how there are card machines on every stall . the servers have skill and they usually skate .	994
0	i have to agree with the fellow reviewer that stated this woukd be the perfect setting for a zombie movie . its always empty and they do not value your patronage or your life . this mall is completely against firearms even when legally concealed . not all entrances are posted against firearms but they expect you to know the rules there . i was escorted out by security because i had a legally concealed firearm to protect myself and family . they lost my patronage .	2815
1	we had a package from book it.com that gave us 20 % off spa services . the first day i went i was in a bit of a rush and had my eyebrows done and she did a fabulous job . since i was getting a discount anyways i just added more to the tip for her . then the following day my fiance ' and i had a side by side couples massage . it was good and we really needed it . the spa is really small , but private . they provide lockers , showers and a separate steam room for men and women .	2317
1	service is very good , my husband does n't want i take his clothes anywhere else .	232
0	https : //www.wsoctv.com/news/local/3-suspects-arrested-after-man-woman-shot-outside-york-co-apartment-complex/837291381 this happened on the front lawn of the willows apartment complex . earlier that day i was walking my dogs and 6 police officers rushed into my building . i do not feel safe here .	3034
0	if you want to feel unwelcomed this is the place to go . not only is the staff unfriendly but the patrons will constantly stare and throw daggers your way if you do n't look like a hipster . the self-service area contained only a few napkins ( which i refilled for the other patrons who rudely stared while i did ) and ran short on eating utensils . two separate times staff members went to the self-service table and did n't bother to refill the forks or knives . when asking the staff questions we were met with ambivalence and made to feel like we were waisting there time . will not ever be back .	1160
0	i am disappointed . heard really good things about this business , but did not have a good experience . took a chanel sandal to get fixed . the sandal color is salmon , they fixed with white sewing thread . to add , the threads were bulky and not delicate as it should 've been . i wo n't be back .	2114
1	my partner and i decided we needed a second vehicle , and we were told by a friend to head over to centaur subaru . we were not disappointed ! the place was super busy ( it was a saturday ) but we were attended to right away . we decided to test drive the crosstrek xv . it was love at first drive ! we came back and started the purchasing process , and had our amazing new subaru by tuesday ! peter and rob took great care of us . we ca n't recommend it enough !	1662
1	$ 25 for a 50 minute massage- what more do you want ? sure the massage is from a student , but they are n't allowed to accept tips . i 've been several times and i 've definitely received quality massages . there are also times when the school offers 2 for 1 weekends- so it 's only $ 12.50 for 50 minutes . the therapists are good about asking if you 'd like more or less pressure so in many ways the quality of the massage is somewhat in your hands . i will definitely be going back !	3008
0	terrible store customer service . some reason every time i go in there is only one cashier and always a line . smaller selection than some other locations .	1955
1	i have been going to michelle for spray tans for about two years now and will never go to anyone else . i even tried going to the charles scott , westlake location and got totally botched . with michelle , ​my tan is even , lasts for more than 10 days , and fades very nicely . highly recommend !	2783
1	very happy with every aspect of our shopping experience . my husband and i were looking for bars tools and we wanted to make sure they were comfortable , so we headed to the showroom in tempe . the people in the showroom were friendly and helpful . the delivery was prompt ( actually earlier than we expected ) and randy , who deliver the bar stools and assembled them , was professional and efficient . we will definitely shop at furniture creations for any future furniture needs .	3854
1	this place is absolutely amazing ! not only is it a five-minute walk to scottsdale stadium , but the employees are the most accommodating i have ever met in all my years of travel . we are traveling with many young children and they got our rooms all near each other ... with cribs . pam , molly , and jeremy are especially outstanding ! we ca n't wait to return next year !	3832
1	i have tried lots of froyo . i 'm kinda ' a conisseur ( sp ? ) at this point . i do love the dulce de leche here . i 'm not as big a fan of most of their other flavors , my my daughter loves their red velvet . the people who work here are nice and it 's a comfortable place . the price is fair , and they have lots of toppings . : )	1145
0	bad food and even worse service . do not waste your time or money . i ordered the cuban sandwich and it tasted like it just came from the microwave .	1241
0	this company is racist . if you are a minority , try getting your ping equipment serviced like lie angle or length for example and see if you get a honest service at the phoenix headquarters . or see if you get rejected by the fitting people there .	2934
1	i had a delightful experience @ tottori allergy & asthma location on west cheyenne in las vegas . dr tottori is outstanding . he helped me tremendously . the staff at this location are absolutely wonderful and so professional . they go out of their way to make your visit as comfortable as possible .	1964
0	if your looking to be lied to , ripped off , and given back a motorcycle in unsafe and worse condition then when you left it with then for a overall check and repair service then they 're the ones your looking for , if not stay away ! ! !	3644
1	i do n't feel like there is much to review for walgreens . i mean they are all the same , are n't they . this one is pretty clean , nicely laid out , cashiers are not slow and/or incompetent - that 's all i need from walgreens	2471
1	i 've been a few times already and have to say the food and service , never disappoints . foodies need to try this place . ca n't wait to go back	553
0	run fast as a matter of fact dont go this guy oscar is a liar and rip off i will see him in court his place needs to be only maybe a brake shop or oil change but then he may even mess that up how can you sleep at night ripping me off . smh	3762
0	this place is very messy and unorganized . the guy at front was often talking on the phone when i was standing at the front desk waiting for assistance . lots of advertisement that he will make you a deal but in all reality he wo n't . just about all his items are over priced . maybe if he would make a deal with someone the prices would be reasonable . also advertised items on craigslist that he never had in the first place . overall not impressed or satisfied .	3400
0	after filing my complaint on sunday , i was told i would receive a follow up by monday . it is now thursday and the company has continued to give me the runaround . i have been given multiple phone # s to call , every person i speak to makes me repeat the entire situation and then tells me to call another person . i finally got the number to who i was told was the general manager but is actually the fleet manager only to get a full voicemail box . probably filled with similar complaints ...	3142
1	i 've been seeing dez for quite some time . i love the fact that she is not only insanely talented but always up for something new . she does a great job at cutting hair but her talent in color is on point . i got to say it 's also a plus that the wash bowl chairs give you a message . i give the salon and dez 100 stars .	335
0	this is the worst so-called semi-private club ever ! over $ 700 a month in dues and they run the public through there like cattle . nothing special being a member . pro shop does not know how to manage the rotation of three nine holes . no , marshall , no starter but at least a beverage cart . would not recommend becoming a member .	3869
0	it 's really a convenient place , but the disappointed part is my family doctor lacks of experiences , acts careless and misdiagnoses . basically he missed the best chance to cure it . i was asking him to give me a thoroughly check in my injury since beginning . after three months i am still in pain and not getting better . i did the opposite of what he had said and went to see a specialist . right move ! at least the injury is in progress ...	592
0	wow 20 dollars for a bistec a lo pobre ok i was fine at first but come on . the quality of this food is not great and amount of food you get is not worth 20 bucks there are other peruvian restaurants way better than this one .	927
1	well priced sushi for what you get . not top notch , but better than your average sushi joint . the assortment of rolls is very basic . if you do n't like california rolls you may not like sakana . my favorite roll was the dragon roll i asked for ( not on the menu ) . the valentines day special with 3 pieces of tuna , albacore , yellowtail , salmon and another tuna was very generous for $ 16.99 . i 'd come here again , but i will be able to wait . it would be a 3.5 but since sushi is n't a specialty in az i 'll round up .	198
0	go elsewhere . used to be a decent place to live but since it 's been under new management things have gone way downhill . hot water is constantly turned off , take weeks to get things fixed even as small as fixing a cabinet door , management is completely unprofessional & extremely rude . all of the review left so far are accurate . save the hassle and go to san marbeya next door .	2492
0	staff is absolutely horrible , and management is worse . i ordered a meal was told no side and smoothie was not discounted . i was charged for each item separately . when i spoke to manager he was not apologetic . i will only visit tropical smoothie at university circle now .	3225
1	i have been a customer for over 10 years ! our whole house is furnished with mor furniture ... ..living room/dinning room/family room/both kids rooms/master bedroom . i love the staff ( especially ron ) , he always know how to make me happy ! thanks for all your help ron ! you are amazing !	1640
1	if you ever have been back east -- new york or dc area . this is home well a larger version of the shops we would go to . so many different food items . i normally go here for my bo ssam lettuce wraps they have such a variance of meats not normally found in even some other places . produce selection is amazing . there is also some really good restaurants just to the side of the store , on the left hand side a little ways down .	3269
0	went to ravi because of the rave reviews on yelp -- very disappointed ! i ordered the chicken stew and my boyfriend had the soup and wrap combo ( mushroom bisque and the steak wrap ) . the soup was delicious for the first few spoonfuls , but after a while , both of us found the soups to be overly salty and overly peppery ! both soups tasted like we were devouring pepper soup . the only high note was the cheddar biscuit , which was particularly tasty .	59
0	avoid this clinic at all costs ! ! ! this clinic is horrid ! ! they made me wait for 90 minutes just for a follow up . the follow up was only 3 minutes ! ! the receptionists are extremely terrible because they did n't consider me when i had other appointments . my follow up was only 3 minutes long ! ! it would have made no difference if i went ahead of other people ! ! when i asked them about my turn , the receptionists purposely picked up the phone and ignored my existence . they 're extremely rude ! ! !	297
1	this location has the best produce.staff is friendly and the store is clean .	3499
1	bakes and goods did a cupcake tower for our wedding . we really liked the way the cupcakes looked and our friends and family thought they tasted great ! the owner was very helpful and responsive to my questions by email . overall , we were satisfied with their services .	3539
0	horrible customer service ! first time was the last time i 'll ever go here and wanted to make sure you and no one else waste 10 bucks on there awful food . asked for a meat and cheese steak no onions . well they decided to make sure i would never come back by servings me one full of onions . how hard is it to listen to the customer after i gave you a 2 dollar tip ? ! do n't make the sandwich you want make the sandwich the customer wants . never do i write reviews and felt the need to share my story of how lazy this company is . do n't eat here ! ! !	777
0	currently sitting in corner alley , eating cold fries after a 30 minute wait . the place is almost dead and yet the kitchen could n't get food out on time . our waitress could barely open her mouth and the other servers are sitting around or dancing to the music , wish i was enjoying my experience as much as they are . i could understand if they were busy , but come on ! for such a nice establishment the service is crap !	742
1	lovely hotel ! we attended a house party for friends in fountain hills and instead of driving home found this little gem on hotel tonight . i was skeptical because the price was so affordable but pleasantly surprised once arriving . the hotel is very quaint and we stayed in one of the remodeled rooms and it was very nice , clean and comfortable . used the hot tub and pool which was relaxing . the breakfast special was delicious as well . recommend this place to anyone traveling to fountain hills !	2866
1	dr welker is the greatest doctor . he has the old fashioned professionalism who listens and the best part understands what you are talking about . he does care and goes over and above to make sure everything is taken care of !	3349
0	no security terrible experience would had had a better time at the drive in sitting in a lawn chair . they had electricial fire in one theater so they has everyone stand in line for the next showing which was delayed . the manager would not make a decision to have the former patrons stand in line with everyone he was allowing them to just cut in line in front of everyone else until people in line asked for security which was afraid to do anything either . the only thing security did was allow handicap in first but that is the only thing good i can say ! ! ! ! !	491
0	the jazz is great . the food and drink , not so much . i agree with an earlier post describing the place as cramped and stuffy ; though , i have n't been to a jazz place that was n't like this . it 's almost a prerequisite for a good jazz place , but at least other places have good food and drink .	3295
0	if you use this company this is just some of the issues you will have to deal with besides broken items and waiting 2 weeks for your items that are promised in 3 days . jasonexpressvanline.com jasonexpressvanline.com 7:28 pm ( 2 hours ago we were considering your request.. until we read your fabricated review.. that is not at all how it happened . i helped you as much as i could ans woukd have continued to help you until you didnt srop calling non stop every day 15 times a day ... too bad . we were going to help you out . you shouldnt have wrote that review..	153
0	this place is so over priced for the small portions they provide . the roti was small with mainly potatoes and very little meat . and talk about salty , . curry chicken dinner was the same thing . salty food with very dry rice and little meat.. now i go to queen and coxwell where beryls pepper pot give you a lot more for your money and their food is actually good .	731
0	they say the beef is organic , who knows . they will only cook the meat to well-done for supposedly food safety reasons . this means the beef will always be dry , chewy , tasteless , hard to digest , and less nutritious . my friend says the vegan burger filled with processed ingredients tastes good .	1571
1	really good guys here ... went in asking about .300 black out , walked out with two boxes of hornady ammo ( under $ 20 bucks ) and hog hunting tips ... not a pressure store , or talk above your common firearm language ... again good ole ' boys here ... will do my next firearm buy here ...	2247
1	very reliable , does a quality job , good location . apparently yelp needs this to be longer so blahhhh blahhhh blahhh 5 stars	3672
1	unlike trendier places full of pseudo-bohemian bs , this denny 's in particular.. always a pleasure . the portions are great , the food is made right , and the one russian lady ( we did n't get her name ) is a super great waitress ! ! i guess it takes trying all of the cool kid places to come full circle to see a good thing when it 's right in front of me ! thanks denny 's ! ! : d	346
1	audrey is awesome ! ! i 've been going there since i moved here . my hair was a hot mess . color and process damaged . and i 'm growing out a short cut . she 's really been awesome about how to keep my hair looking like something while helping me get to my long term goal . the instructor , rachael has been super awesome as well . great group there !	354
1	super efficient plus they price match , which makes them the cheapest in town . robbie is super helpful and made everything really easy . definitely nice to have them so close by .	3090
0	went hoping to have an awesome experience . beds were not clean , hard selling me on lotions was a complete turn off ! wo n't return !	2604
0	horrible . she kept leaving during my massage . we paid for a 70 minute massage and it was less than an hour . then when we were leaving the lady told me to tip her more . what a joke . do not go to this sleezy place . so many other reflexology joints that are worth it .	2014
0	this company came out to fix a minor condensation problem , the very next time i turned on my a/c it was not working . they came out again to say that my valve was broken and quoted almost $ 2000.00 to repair it , but suggested i needed a whole new unit . they quoted $ 5200.00 , but when john showed up to provide financing information he bumped the price up to almost $ 8000.00 . i do not trust this company at all . since than , i have received two other quotes for less than $ 5000 for a whole new unit . beware people . i would not trust this company and i would watch them carefully around your system .	2203
1	i went here while visiting family and i love this place ! ! they have great flavors ( my favorite is birthday cake ) and a great amount of toppings . i love that you pay by the cup and not the ounce that is such a clever idea . they also have slices of cakes and full cakes in a freezer by the register which looked good as well . the establishment was extremely clean and well kept up i would definitely go here again and recommend it to others .	3286
1	i had an absolute blast shooting the phoenix coyotes commercial with movie work now !	64
0	i hate when i go to a business and ask how long it will take and they lie and exaggerate the truth . just give me an hour huh ? ? omg ! we 've been waiting for over 2 hours for a simple oil change . first time customer and wo n't ever come back . i just hope i do n't have any issues with my car afterwards cause the trust is out the door ! ugh . any recommendations they make for service will be done somewhere else !	3795
1	it 's right next to the mall and some other stores and restaurants . it 's open 24 hours so that 's good if you need a pack of condoms real cheap lol . i did see they change stuff around so i just had to get use to where everything was but over all it 's a great walmart .	2141
1	ignacio came out on a 105 degree day within one hour of my phoning and found the freon leak in the hvac on my roof . he fixed the leak , charged the ac and now the unit works perfectly again . thank you so much . i could not have received better or more timely service .	601
0	went for the angus steak breakfast sandwich , did n't know it was discontinued . ended up getting the double sausage , egg , cheese sandwich on a bagel . the cheese really did n't taste like cheese . some spice in the sausage really reminded me of a cleaning solution , it was very odd . save yourself the money and get something else . still a good place for donuts and coffee though .	1532
1	i get all of my climbing/bouldering equipment from r.e.i . i really like the store and the quality of the merchandise is great . i think that the prices on some items are a bit high in my opinion but over overall it 's great . most of the employees are very nice and friendly while others not so much but then again you find that everywhere you go . i recommend this place specially if you are looking for climbing/bouldering equipment and i 'm sure if you find anything else it is going to be great quality .	1059
1	went here for lunch with the family . we got the flatbread pizza , shrimp poboy and the burger . everything was great but our favorite was the burger and fries ... wow ! ! ! ! probably one of the best burgers we 've ever had . environment was upscale ( i do n't dress trendy enough to fit in there , haha ) and staff were friendly and responsive . we 'll be back	49
0	just spend 20 minutes in the drive thru , they were out of the munchkins i wanted and the dozen of donuts are got are stale and do n't even look good . waste of breakfast and time . wo n't be coming back here !	1761
0	used to be a great place , but has gone way downhill . it now has the rudest waitress ever , autumn , and donnie is gone . we all just ended up leaving and finding another lounge . no refund . we wo n't be back .	3013
1	i love this place ! if you are looking for friendly staff , great environment and a clean salon this is the place for you . i have been going for a year now and it 's great !	3660
0	let me start off by stating that i love dollar tree . however this particular one disgusted me beyond . all different types of consumers shop at dollar tree and this location would n't fit anyone . the floors were filled with days maybe even weeks worth of debris . it 's very concerning because all it takes is a broom and you sell them . i wo n't come back , we will go to the one on decatur since they seem to not be afraid of 2 minutes of work .	1956
1	thanks yellow cab for being there when the green one was n't . i usually dial the 2002000 number but it wasnt working . so i tried yellow cab they were on time , the cab was clean and the driver was personable . i even lost my phone inside the cab and later that day the nice driver dropped it off . hats off to you yellow cab	3142
0	are you people that deprived of good halal joints that you ca n't even tell what 's good ? apple butter burger was full of fat and tasted so gamey ! bun was way too big . sauce was a regular bbq . go check out hero burger or mushkaki instead . you 're even better off going to burger factory . if you can make the trek , kensington market has 2 halal burger joints that top this place .	940
1	excellent thai food . just the right amount of spice ! i had the cashew nut and my wife had the pad thai . they were both great !	973
1	i have been taking my 18 mo . old son to this practice ever since he was born and i am very pleased with them . they offer two locations with numerous doctors for ultimate convenience . i have been to both locations but prefer their main office which is closest to my house . both offices however are extremely clean and inviting . their staff is diligent , scheduling is effortless ( either by phone or your online patient portal ) and they are exceptionally punctual with appointments . i highly recommend north scottsdale pediatrics to all the parents out there !	3134
1	i travel across town every 2 weeks . 45min drive . the customer service & nail services i receive are the best i 've ever had .	3509
0	do n't go with this company . called and tried scheduling to have my ac unit looked at as it stopped working and it 's 112 degrees outside . they told me they cant have a tech come out until monday next week , and it was a tuesday when i called . tried seeing if they could work with me but the guy victor who answered the phone just put me on hold and never came back on the line . basically just hung up on me .	601
0	with a very fake and annoying smile i was told they do n't accept a reward for my beverage .	2841
0	played this course today , course was in ok shape . there is no sand in bunkers , but i guess if you do n't it into them you should n't have to worry . there was no ranger on course at time s there was 3 foursomes on same hole led to 6 hour round . if they are going to allow this slow pace make the cart girl work all day only saw her once on front side . i do not recommend this course .	85
0	went to the rocky river location . the selection was very limited ( it was 12 in the afternoon ) now , i understand they 're not going to have all the flavors , but they had about 5 flavors . my girlfriend and i tried 4 different cupcakes , and we were not impressed . the cake itself was fine , but the icing just tasted bad. , not sweet at all . this was the first cupcake i ever threw away in my life . i guess i 'll stick with grandma freda 's at the westside market . much better product .	2335
1	great gym w/friendly staff . ca n't get any better than three locations for the price of one .	3898
1	after reading some reviews on this course , i was concerned that there would be a problem with pace of play , but we finished in 4 hr 20min , course condition not bad . customer service from pro shop & snack bar were great . would play here again . great value .	1138
1	i got a referral from my friend who used titan on her house . i had 2 different areas leaking and had them come out to give me a price . i also got 2 other prices from different companies and titan was much better priced , and when they did the job they were very professional ! i would recommend them to anyone looking for roof repairs or any roof service . they fixed my roof before all the rain we had and could n't be happier with the fact that nothing leaks anymore . thank you titan for the amazing job and not breaking my piggy bank : )	3763
1	i 'm giving them 5 star ... not because they are good , but because they are exactly what their name says they are . they are slow , the store is dirty , and smells . yet , i go here nearly everyday because at least i know what to expect . and , some of their personnel at the register are cool .	1544
1	i was impressed with this place . great deli/sandwich place , but also sports salads , panini 's , fresh baked bread , bakery and even pizza . i '' m yet to try the pizza , but i can vouch for the sandwiches and salads . it is pricey at nearly $ 7 a sandwich , but i did notice some deals such as two large pizza , two toppings for $ 20 . it 's worth a taste .	1356
0	`` meh '' really sums it up for me . this store is big , so there 's lots to explore . it seemed decently clean and the people working here are nice . merchandise quality is definitely low - lots of chewbacca collector glasses , tons of old buttons and pins , dishware from the 70's/80 's , etc . most items are n't much better than rummage sake or flea markets . i did see some cool vintage travel posters but let 's just say the pricing was `` ambitious '' . granted , everyone collects or is interested in different things so maple bluff might be your thing . it 's not for me , though .	2155
0	stopped here to get my battery checked since it was on my route . the service was depressing . i walked in and stood behind one guy at the counter . he was helped then before i could approach another guy walks up and the employee sees me but proceeds to help the other guy . vanessa finally came to help ... .. but not before making me wait another 4-5 minutes while she discusses another issue with her supervisor and answers questions from another customer . this place only got two stars since my battery was fine but just got low .	2396
0	dishes was dirty and food not cooked fully , been on action 13 news 3 times for dirty dining	1361
0	horrible . i went in for fillers under my eyes , my lips and smile lines . also botox and thermage . my eyes and lips look worse than before . actually want my eyes undone if that possible . it took months for the swelling and bruising to go away . had to go back 3 times to get the botox right . they told me after i did thermage that it only lasts 9 months , before i had it done they said it lasts 3-5 years ! ! ! big difference . dont go here	582
1	i needed transportation for what turned out to be a very short time while my car was broken down . luis came and picked me up and was extremely nice and personable . the paperwork was quick , and i was on my way in plenty of time to meet the tow truck back at the car . i ended up returning the car the same day , and luis once again gave me a ride back . the entire experience could not have been smoother , and luis helped make a very stressful day much easier to get through .	2177
0	i liked the red velvet cake better when tammie made if for lagrande orange- now 50 % too much cream cheese and the red sprinkles are pretty but ruin the velvet texture . great blackberry bran muffin as always !	1125
1	small but nice fried chicken restaurant ! i love the fried chicken and taiwanese style pulled pork on a bun . the bubble tea 's also good ! lucy , thank you for bringing me here lol	566
1	we had such a great experience on the rooftop patio . the raspberry lemonade was yummy ! our server richie was very accommodating , we were in a rush & he got everything sent out quickly . we will definitely be back .	621
0	worst nail place i 've ever been too . my nails look like crap ! ! ! i 'm so disappointed . the only reason i paid full price which i think i was charged for is because the guy was really nice . however , the nail design i asked for is ridiculously horrible . all my nails are slanted and uneven . my pedicure was really expensive but halfed as* ! i will never go back there . i should of just waited till monday to get my nails done now i 'm out of 75 dollars for a trash job . this place should be disappointed on the job they did .	2496
1	always my go to place for the many supplies i always need ... i do several crafty things : acrylic paints on canvas , watercolors , drawings , woodworking , sewing , food crafting , making wreaths/holiday decor , jewelry , its endless . i just wish i would get coupons like `` 20 % off your entire purchase '' instead of `` 40 % off one item . '' i never buy any one thing over $ 10 , and you ca n't use it on things already on sale . whatever , i ca n't stop shopping there ; there are too few stores like this as it is . also walmarts art section is n't as good as this one store . lol	1615
0	the worst company ever to handle your process serving needs . unprofessional . aggressive . rude . and unethical . i hired june for a simple process service job and they could n't have botched it more . it took three servers to get the papers served and in the end , turns out , it was not done legally . tried to get a refund and no response . when they wanted my money they called back right away but to get my money back it was a ghost town at june 's legal services . do yourself a favor and find another company or mail it certified !	1932
1	everything you could possibly want from a juice bar . a great variety of juices and smoothies . as an extra , they have amazing sandwiches , salads and even super healthy breakfast wraps . you have to have the chocolate muffin ! ! ! the owner makes them fresh !	3026
1	so good ! ! i 'm a french fri snob and these are some of the best hands down gabriela was our server , her recommendations were spot on ! ! the turtle soup rocks ! ! i saw a past review of the service and i 'm shocked we 've been there multiple times and were treated with fantastic service every time some people just ca n't be made happy , no matter what you do we 'll be back to see you gabriela ! ! !	452
0	went here 4 times , 2 of the 4 was to get my gel manicure re-done . all bubbly and rough . so much time wasted . after giving them a second chance i end up wasting 2 more hours in getting my nails re-done , all while the nail tech was practicing her english by asking me about my personal life . super fun . then owner blamed the poor quality on his tech , then does an even worse job . told him if i was n't given a discount or something free i was n't coming back , he said he did n't care . so , super excellent customer service . do n't come here unless you like being massively punished .	1838
0	i came with my dad on a sunday afternoon in the winter and the area was pretty empty . there does n't seem to be much to do or see ( especially in winter ) aside from the incline . there are n't many shops ; most of the area consists of restaurants , most of which are chains like the hard rock café , the melting pot , and joe 's crab shack . it 's not really somewhere i 'd go ( nor recommend out-of-towners visit ) unless it was to go to one of the restaurants .	3152
0	great to have our new gym across the street . love the layout and staff but the child center is another ball game ! all young staff and clearly first job.. no manager present and teen ran operation . son had come back with quite a few bumps and comments that could be avoided with more oversight . i mean.. he does n't even want to go back ! give some attention to this management.. please .	3268
0	i came here for a class , price is decent , location was hard to find . instructor was awesome . the staff was friendly . how ever , if your there for the 7 hour class , i recommend not using the restrooms . it was disgusting ! ! all the toilets were full , and in one stall there was something all over the floor and toilet seat . it was horrendous . i recommend going to another building if you need to go . i would give more stars if it was cleaner and i hope i do n't catch a disease .	235
0	i 've spent over $ 3000 in 2 yrs . there prices are high , along with labor . they change managers too often . the district manager assisted me . and really did n't know what was wrong with my car . they charged me $ 720.00 the car stopped the next day . i took it back . they said it would cost me over $ 900 more dollars . i left and purchased another car that saturday . i am now left with a $ 720.00 credit card payment to meineke . this establishment will never see me again .	2711
1	been here a couple times now and i must say they get better every time . my first time was okay , nothing spectacular but this time i went i needed to get a gel fill and reshape and they did an awesome frikken job . this is definitely my go to place now . i wish i could go more often but it 's a little out of the way for me and i 'm super lazy on my fills but regardless this would be the place id go !	819
1	loved the service and the atmosphere : ) went there for a haircut and helen did a great job with my hair , she knew from the moment she saw me what i want and need : ) very pleasant staff which makes it a win ! will definitely come back again	2509
1	i have to say that this office really has it together , they are so organized and friendly ! dr. j. phillipp is a great dentist , very friendly and professional . the dental assistants that helped in my procedure were amazing , jewel and bailey helped me to feel comfortable ! i do n't have dental insurance , but they have this insurance through their office you can purchase for $ 80 something a year and this gave me 25 % off all of my dental work , plus they helped me get signed up for care credit which i knew nothing about before this visit ! i highly recommend this office for the nice synergy the whole office has !	905
0	worst service ever . do n't walk away , run . if you can get direct tv do it . if you ca n't , anything is better than cox .	2633
0	although my one-year lease has ended , i have not received any communication regarding my current status as a month-to-month renter . i have paid in full each month and have stuck to my lease agreement . o'harmony has now begun to harass me for an extra payment . i receive daily emails stating i have not paid for the month of april . the emailed statement does show my payment but they did not zero out the balance . i am fed up companies like this who attempt to use mob style tactics to extort and harass the people . i believe they have watched to many vegas mob movies . bad , bad , bad ! shame on you o'harmony !	1578
0	i stopped in to drop off my shoes and porn was blasting on a tv in the back room ! ! he took my info and never turned it down . it was not just a sex scene in a movie , the words of hard core porn . ive never heard such offensive language . the same channel was on when i picked up my shoes a week later .	1266
0	went to them before it was sold but tried them once ; last year on my birthday my daughter and future daughter in law took me there to do nails but i was extremely embarrassed they harassed me a a disputed past charge when their system was down ( over a year before that ! ) . i weir this now bcuz it 's exactly a year today . i found a great place on the other side of 215 on rainbow called lily -- try it ! great place ! by the way , it was ronnie who was so rude !	3831
1	this is a great pub ! we often stop here for early dinner with the kids when we are visiting my mom and the service is always friendly . a few times we have made this the meeting place for a night out to meet up with friends and family ... everyone always seems to enjoy their food and the staff always accommodate our large group . it is what it is ... a pub ! a really great pub !	1569
0	woooaaaahhh ! ! ! no se si cambiaron el cosinero pero hoy ordene unos tacos cual x sierto estan buenos pero hoy savian tan feos que hasta tuve que marcar para hacerles saver . segundo la salsa roja pense ay a lo mejor save feo x los tacos que compre pero no tambien la salsa nomas de pensar tenia un savor no muy placentero. ! la verdad muy muy decepcionada !	322
0	dolce is not a sweet dining experience . the restaurant is crowded with too many tables in the for the square footage.. service was slow and inattentive . the entrée was returned because it was too salty , no alternative was offered . obviously a poorly managed establishment . save yourself the frustration and visit other italian restaurants in the area . here 's a link to the top 10 ( notice dolce is not one of them ) : http : //www.10best.com/destinations/north-carolina/charlotte/restaurants/italian/	563
1	great for happy hour ! they also have all you can eat tacos for $ 5 every friday . ask for rich as a bartender . he 's the man .	1074
0	went about a week ago . the bouncer did n't accept my legit id . they need to have a scanner or be better trained because i felt so stupid when he accused me of it being fake . finally they let me in , it was alright ; cool environment , did n't really know what to do or where to sit . would not recommend . there are other places on mill that are way better .	1176
0	one star because i ca n't give zero . unorganized unprofessional and extremely unhelpful . after being the wrong carpet to my house the charlotte installation department left me with a room with no rug , a hallway full of furniture and misse two guaranteed appointment times . terrible ! ! ! !	2611
1	great lunch buffet . jake and riley were amazing . these two helped my large party of 20+ have an excellent experience . they were attentive , polite , organized , and quickly responded to any of our requests . they were speedy and answered all of our questions ! they deserve special recognition for their service . additionally , their thin crust pizza was so good - crispy and light ! my favorite was the thin crust with jalapeños . we needed many vegetarian pizzas which they made for us from scratch ! i ca n't believe it !	1283
1	awesome pho , vermicelli bowl ( spicy pork and shrimp ) , and bomb banh mi . service was great as well and waters were filled quickly . would not recommend the spring rolls .	673
1	august , 2016 - this place has expanded and remodeled . for an airport coffee joint , it 's really very good .	2804
1	kudos to 2 employees at this location . very professional , painless experience . i had a lot of questions and their patience and professionalism never wavered . it was a pleasure meeting fernando and rheianon and being taken care of by them .	1726
1	cozy , small town cafe feeling . lovely decor and pleasant background music . i had the choco-walnut cookie and an iced mocha . will definitely be back !	1108
1	phonomenal ! best pho in the valley ! their chili sauce can not be beat and they really do n't skimp on the veggies in the veggie pho . the atmosphere is great- they never play stupid music , it 's clean , energetic and really makes you feel good . i phofucking love this place !	205
0	this is definitely the worse restaurant i have ever been ! im a cantonese and i know what cantonese food like but the food there just ridiculously expensive ! $ 6 for one awful dim sum doesnt make any scene ! and those waiters and waitress is the worse ! just please dont go there ! im doing you a favor	113
0	had them come out and look at my place for bi-weekly maintenance . told them we like the plants and bushes to grow natural - just trim the stragglers , cut the grass , clean up . first visit - looked like a 4 year old got hold of a weed whacker and attacked our bushes . called in their management , asked him to review pictures his guy took , and he defended their work ! ! second visit - after telling the owner just cut the grass and clean up debris - guess what - the four year old was back resolution - fired them . worse yet , their price was 50 % hiring than the last guy .	2759
0	this store has gone right down hill staff are rude never any hot roast turkey for sale no rustic bread for the last two weeks the manager at this store needs to be fired not doing his or her job discracefull	2316
1	food was good . just your average wings burgers place . food came out pretty fast . our server was awesome though . nothing too exciting about this place , but it was good .	1487
0	i was walking through the aisles with my kids and one of my girls comes around the corner holding a huge knife . the staff has a side table set up at the end of one of the aisles by the fish takes with knifes sitting out in the open . not safe petco ! ! this gave me a heart attack seeing my three year old grabbing for a table with knifes . no employee 's in site at all ! ! just horrible . what are the knifes even for ?	2174
1	this is my go to over mitchell 's every single time . a cincinnati native here ( where graeter 's is from ) so this is a no-brainer . nationally , the most popular flavor is black raspberry chip , and also known for the rich large chunks of chocolate spread throughout the ice cream . i also love the buckeye blitz . there is no richer peanut butter ice cream anywhere . service here was great , it was clean . go here , even oprah loves it !	2797
1	always an awesome experience and for a reasonable price . if you need a quality cut , look for these guys . sammy is my go to but you also have scott and eric , both great .	2366
0	i like the people who work at this walmart more then average , but the lines are always too long . come to this walmart night of day and there will only be maybe 2 lanes opens and you 'll be waiting at least 10 minutes to check out .	3318
0	steve hatsakorzian is a total bully . luckily i do n't have to deal with him that long . please do not do business with him in any way ! not only wasting your time and money . he will drive you crazy ! steve hatsakorzian , people hire you for doing your job which i thought was property manager , but no ... you just want to play your power game and torture everyone . good luck for all the people who have to work with him , the worst property manager in arizona .	3723
0	was expecting a little bit better given the reviews . i will say that the staff was very friendly . philly cheesesteak sliders were good ( get them with jalapeno peppers ) . buffalo wings just ok . i was excited about the fried pickles , but they were disappointing . first , you need to know that they 're pickle spears , not slices/chips ; i 've never seen that before . dipping sauce was very thin/runny . plenty of beer choices , and the different specials as others have noted are nice . i 'd try another place next time .	717
1	for all you people complaining about wait time , you need to take into account that all blood testing is done right there in the office , saving you another wait at another office for blood draw , most of your supplements are right there in the office saving you a trip to the store and dr. monroe takes the time to listen to all of your concerns and addresses them instead of prescribing a pharmaceutical and sending you on your way in five minutes . if you want substandard service go to a substandard doctor .	3323
1	came in almost closing time to have my broken nail fixed since i had to work the following day . i called and they took me in , fixed my nail and even did gel and manicure , no rushing . very pleased with the service and staff . they saved my nail and day , will be going back : )	2929
1	my boyfriend and i love this place . the environment is super cool with all of the games , tv 's , and artwork . the food is to die for ... .especially the tamago burger , just prepare for it to be messy haha . i would definitely recommend trying this restaurant ! ps . freeze the tip jelly ! !	964
1	this is my favorite place . i love that there is such variety and everything is in such great condition . it 's a beautiful store so you feel like you can take your time and really put together some great looks . the best part is the value ! i can come out with two or three whole outfits ( accessories and all ! ) for under $ 50 ! this place rocks !	3007
1	the sale associates are always extremely helpful and will find somebody to help if they ca n't . they always have the newest products , and the artists are great for when you need your makeup done .	2574
1	the new bartender brittany is hilarious ! it 's nice to see a cute and friendly bartender serving the neighborhood . favorite little bar !	2894
0	front desk reception do not know how to do their job . they keep trying to tell me i had to pay for the visit and my health card was expired when it was n't . i stood there when i first arrived waiting while the finished gossiping . no customer service skills whatsoever and incompetent . scary .	592
0	i was excited to try this place because i had seen the good reviews . they were totally rude and patronizing . they practically insulted my friend who came in with me wanting a small cover . i even had to draw her cover for them to give them any perspective ! for my cover , they tried to push me towards some generic girly piece of crap . i just ate the deposit ; i did n't want them to touch my skin .	2621
1	i have n't been to this location in some time and i must say i 'm impressed with the changes . there are staff everywhere and very helpful and friendly . the store was clean and stocked . really quiet , no music or anything , which seemed weird but then again i watch a lot of zombie shows .	1178
1	huge fan of pevonia products ; carmel day spa is the only place in charlotte that provides them . i 've never had any issues with the aestheticians . each time the facial and extractions have meet my expectations . i do n't care about ambiance my main concern is great extractions and glowing skin . i 'd recommend elsewhere.. if you are looking for total relaxation and ambiance . hope this helps !	3554
1	i like parking here because it is covered and less expensive than other lots . some people do n't like taking the shuttle over to the airport but i do n't mind . flying is a giant hassle anyway so what 's another 15 minute shuttle ride ? ?	248
0	first time customer experience ... .very slow ( 2hrs + ) for a simple oil change , cliff tried to insist additional work was required when it was not . could n't wait to leave and wo n't be back	3052
0	i have heard many things of this place and it definitely did not live up to its hype . ordered the hot grass jelly and black sesame dessert . the jelly was delicious , but this quality can be found at other locations ( ie . sugar marmalade ) - tea is lacking in flavor food was not savory . the black sesame was way too thin . considering staples of chinese desserts was not up to par , i would not recommend	1062
0	the waiter we had had been working there for 5 days . there were other wait staff did n't even attempt to help him . we waited 10 minutes before someone came over . the manager walked by did n't even stop . when our order was taken he could n't get that right . not completely his fault since he was new ... needless to say , we left while he was still trying to key in our order ... service was terrible . needs new management .	1549
1	it 's been about a week now since they tinted my windows on my 2013 hyundai & i ca n't ask for anything better . these guys were so personable , and professional . they even offered to take me home cause they knew it would take awhile . but i would definitely recommend my fam here and continue doing business . thanks again too shelf	1512
1	the brisket was really good . the hamburger was above average . the loaded fries were huge portions , and were pretty good . 4 stars because the place is unique in a neighborhood of chain-restaurant blandness . the menu is `` brave '' considering we are becoming a world of calorie nannies . eat here , if for no other reason , you are unlikely to ever see another restaurant like this one .	144
0	i went to this np after seeing positive yelp reviews . i went for my annual well woman visit , which should have been entirely covered . my insurance billed me $ 150 for tests they required me to do . i specifically stated i did not want additional tests performed and was informed that certain tests ( i.e . chlamydia and gonorrhea ) were required for women under a certain age . be warned these `` required '' tests are not preventative care covered by insurance . it 's just a way to get more money . do not go here .	2921
1	so glad i called these guys . i can finally sleep at night without a whistling of an always running toilet . frank m was awesome , so nice , and explained everything throughly to me . i 'd def call mr. rooter again .	2748
1	i really enjoy this bar . it 's a great place to take visiting friends and family . always get great service from the manager , casey . looking forward to my next time there .	780
0	i like the store but when it comes to the actual pharmacists they do n't even deserve 1 star . they are racist and have poor people skills . will definitely not be going back .	3411
1	very friendly , fast no wait . local small business ! they are great ial is great , and quick def a 5 star !	3617
0	bland ordered taro milk tea with boba ... ... tasted like milk with taro powder added to it should 've went to quickly	1301
0	outdated decor ... slow and unfriendly service ... paid $ 130 for 2 people ( no cocktails ) for chinese food that was equivalent to a average chinese buffet . save yourself the money and frustration and eat at beijing no . 9	171
1	the customer service was amazing ! our sales associate was not only extremely helpful but was very patient with my boyfriend and i as we had a some stupid squabble over the couch we were looking at . lol . the prices were awesome and we found a couch that was exactly what we were looking for !	1710
0	do n't get caught ordering a car wash if you just want to drive through when you 're getting gas or you 'll get ripped off and have to pay more than just exterior wash cost and you ca n't choose the cheaper one . i assumed which was wrong that a $ 15 car wash would include interior and it does n't it was the express wash which is n't much different from the 3 to 6 dollar wash so buyer beware . i wo n't make that mistake again	988
0	poor customer service for the bakery area ! they use to make this cake i 've been wanting and i asked the gal if she 's able to make it for me and she said no we stopped ! but here i have another location that 's willing to make it for me that went above and beyond for their customers ! i will be going to the other location more even though it 's a long drive jst for better service !	2785
0	this place is like if someone always wanted to brew beer and have a brewery but instead opened a really low quality burger joint that is way over priced . the food was cold and nobody working there seemed over 21 . save your money place is all looks with bad food	1046
1	go to this gym everyday and do n't have any issue with it . staff always very welcoming when you arrive and not ever to crazy crowded like most are . this is a good la fitness ! !	3912
1	i love going to asian markets , so i was thrilled to find a korean market . it was late in the evening when i stumbled upon this place after dinner . they had a lot of products to offer , the problem is some of the aisles are too cramped . but they did offer ready to eat items that kids love , like gimbap and mini seafood pancake for that late night snack when in vegas . they also have a food court with a good selection of options to please everyone . this place will be a frequent place to stop by when in vegas .	715
0	went there yesterday at 3pm for a apple fritter . i asked if it was fresh . the clerk told me no so i did not buy . then went there at 7am and asked the clerk if the donuts were fresh and she said , `` yes they were made last night . '' really ? ? ? that is not fresh ! ! ! then i got attitude from the clerk , she said , `` if you want to buy , buy , if you do n't , do n't .	3322
1	great service , great result . these guys always do a fantastic job washing my truck when i bring it in . my car is very large ( hummer h1 ) so i do n't trust putting it through a machine , this guys do a fantastic job hand washing and waxing it . it always shines and looks in perfect condition right after . if you are looking for a quality hand wash in the charlotte area this is the place to go .	3061
0	the airport location for the 2nd consecutive year did not honor the original reservation rate and said they could n't change it after 3 unanswered voicemails and equally unsatisfactory calls to corporate the manager will not return phone any calls this year they at the last minute added a 200 extra surcharge that was not disclosed on my original nor on their copy nor is it posted anywhere so if you are unfortunate to arrive in the wee hours of the morning hertz will most definitely take advantage and charge whatever they want	1660
1	if you love pink , girly , and awesome ... you have to check out this salon . i have gotten my nails done here a few times and i would n't suggest it . however , i do get my hair cut here frequently and i would suggest their hair salon services to any one of my friends for a great experience .	916
0	worst company ever ! ! ! ! no customer service . if you call on sunday you 're out of luck and they do n't care ! !	2633
1	super cute for going out as a friend group but not really if you 're looking to actually skate , the ice is never smoothed over and the rink is super small . definitely instaworthy though !	3364
0	over 1 hour wait time is completely unacceptable , unprofessional and disrespectful to the patient . i was seen for less than 5min . i moved here from out-of-state , and unfortunately got stuck coming here to see dr layton . treatment was 100 % ineffective , i called a month later and was told that i need to wait up to 90 days . that 's funny , i usually see results within 2 weeks at my previous dermatology clinic ... .	2099
1	in the westland shopping center i hope to hell that smart & final takes every bit of business from walmart everything that can be done wrong is n't walmart they are friendly and trying like heck to be the best they can be as smart and final it 's worth going to smart & final take the trip across the parking lot never ever go to the scummiest walmart on earth ever ever ever smart & final nice pleasant people care	3499
0	have been here for lunch a few times , and the same thing happened over and over - short staffed ! the servers are stressed and worn out , and not a smile can be found on their faces . you would be ignored no matter where you sit . be prepared to flag them for a few times before you will be noticed . poor service is expected when understaffed . food is mediocre .	176
0	worst company ever ! first they sold me synthetic shoes for leather and they also sent the wrong size . now they are also refusing to send me a prepaid return label and expecting me to pay for the return .	2910
0	i rented a property from this company ... .it was infested with cockroaches for months and months complained and put in work orders ... only for the work orders to be closed without anything actually being done ... then the refrigerator goes out and i am told that i am the one who is responsible for fixing it or that i should buy a new one ... the actual address is 3234 n 38th street but from the looks of the other reviews none of there properties look trust worthy	843
1	had fun in the mirror maze . try to go when it 's not too crowded . we arrived at 1230 on a saturday and just one other person inside . got busier as we walked through . you can see it all on the one trip ticket $ 4 . just keep wandering around until you see it all . did n't try the laser challenge .	3060
0	this hotel is in a great location , and the lobby looks very nice and updated . unfortunately despite having a reservation ( and being part of a larger group reservation that included a reservation of one of their meeting rooms ) and calling to confirm late arrival , they had a system glitch that caused my hotel room reservation to be `` dropped . '' while they did cover a replacement room at the nearby westin , upfront communication including an attempt to contact me would have been preferred ( especially after they confirmed adding a note to my file about my late arrival ) .	3859
1	best dotty 's in town . if you 're lucky enough to be here when josh is working , then you 're in luck . he is so attentive and treats everyone awesome ! ! josh is the best ! !	1066
0	not worth the stress and time ! spent a long time at my house trying to sell me , never sent me the quote , no return calls , horrible follow through . would not recommend their services at all !	3881
1	what a great time . a well-planned festival with great live music . this puts the arizona state fair to shame . everything just seemed so clean and well organized . ca n't wait till next year !	759
0	the place was clean and i liked their beds . as a first time customer the girls should have known better then to stick me in a bed with new bulbs . i have been peeling for several days now . my skin is itchy and blotchy and in the best bed they had i have a large spot all the way down the side of my body the bulbs did n't get . at this point i 'm glad they had n't because i 'm red and peeling everywhere .	2774
0	i am unsure if the dogstop is getting to big for itself or too busy , but i have had issues with them and wont likely be taking him there again . after the last time my boyfriend went to get my pet 's nails cut they informed him that i was told he was too aggressive for them to do his nails . i was never told this and my boyfriend ( who took him the time before ) was never told . i was unsure if they were confused between two max 's but this upset me .	3130
1	i went originally on a wednesday evening to go check it out , have a beer , and play on the bar game machine . definately liked it ! i decided to go back on a saturday night to see how it compared to wednesday , and it was even better . it 's a very laid back small bar and as someone said before they do have the wii in the corner that you can play on ( how awesome is that ) ! drinks were cheap and the bartender was super sweet ( april ) . good music selection and it doesnt get too crowded . everyone should definately check this place out = )	1688
1	this review is for the black jack dealers . they were absolutely amazing ! very engaging and very sweet . you could tell they were n't fake when they wanted us to win . all the ladies were upbeat . i would definitely gamble here again just because of their attitude .	3630
0	the receptionist on the phone is a horrible and rude person . i wish i could give zero stars . she yelled when i asked for information and then yelled she did n't like her job . i think they want to replace her if they want to have a great business .	999
1	very friendly and knowledgable staff . service was fast and we were on our way in no time at all .	269
0	i 've been shopping here while attending asu and never had a great experience , but today i was met with three of the most rude employees . one of them made an extremely rude comment to me when i kindly asked for help unlocking a product . this employee was just standing behind the registers laughing with another employee doing nothing . so a different employee had to help . after waiting in line again the cashier that helped me did n't even say one word to me because she was laughing and loudly swearing with her colleagues .	3318
1	`` the photographers toys r us '' if you 're a professional photographer or a self proclaimed amateur photographer , there is no other place to shop at . they have absolutely everything you can dream of . now all this being said , they are n't necessarily the best deal in town . but it 's a fantastic place to start your search . go in , ask your questions , and be on your way . these guys are pros , not booger eaters from best buy .	1809
0	my movie has n't even started yet and i 'm not impressed . now do n't get me wrong , the new different design from the other theaters is really nice . but , come on ! these are suppose to be assigned seating ! when we came in people were sitting in our seats saying `` oh they just told us to sit anywhere . '' if you going to have assigned seating you better have it for everyone ! not to mention it was completely filthy ! i 've never been to a dirtier theater in my life . there was popcorn all over the seats . one of our seats were wet ! it 's ridiculous ! never going again !	564
1	came here after my friend seano suggested that we try it out after una pizza down the road said a 1 hour wait for a table . seano can be a bit hit and miss with his restaurant suggestions but he hit the nail on the head with cibo . the dishes are served in portions ( similar to tapas ) so you are meant to order a few and share them amongst yourself . we ordered 4 dishes and 2 pizzas and that was more than enough for the 4 of us ! nice setting as well and it 's big enough that i do n't think you would have to worry about booking a table beforehand .	102
1	we visited osmow 's to check it out before ordering catering and it was delicious . our kids loved it too . we ended up ordering catering from them and everything was top notch ! great first experience ! thanks !	678
0	i walked in the salon and no one greeted me at all & they clearly saw me come into the salon . lady turned back to look at who walked in and did n't say `` hi welcome etc '' i just find that rude tbh . oh but they 're nice to you when they take your money .	786
1	pickup and dropoff were easy and painless . they had to bring our toyota corolla from t1 which took abt 20 minutes , but once we got it we found it clean and sturdy . will be back when at toronto pearson ! !	1660
1	we ordered our dining table through amazon and we 're pleasantly surprised to receive it a week earlier than expected . great price and fast . boom , super stoked . delivery was right to our doorstep and the delivery man was professional and nice . thanks guys .	3854
0	for those of us who live in southern highland this is the only option . on the positive side , it has a decent and varied selection of equipment , it is small and so because of the way the machines are laid out you can do a workout staring at someones ass . worst of all , it is filthy . the staff does a decent job of cleaning the cardio equipment but the remaining equipment ( benches , free weights etc ... ) are disgusting . it 's like hepatitis on a stick .	2919
1	i forgot to review my stop at zen . it 's been about 1 month ago , but the people were very nice , albeit they do not speak much english . the service was good , the value was excellent and i 'd definitely return . i used the yelp 15 % coupon and it was even a better deal . i think people may get a little turned off by the overall appeal of the establishment both outside and inside , but once you are getting your massage , you do n't even think about it or notice it . it 's a nice break from intense sports betting . strong recommendation here .	735
0	do not bring your poor animals here ! these groomers are not animal people and they do a cheap job at an expensive price . they do n't seem to know much about cutting hair in general bc all dogs who come here get shaved down with a razor . i witnessed them shaving a labrador and when the poor dog yelped in pain bc they nicked him , they smacked him and it made him yelp more . it was awful to see and my sheltie was very nervous , so we left . i will go out of town to groom my dog before i bring him to petsmart ever again !	514
1	it 's starbucks . a little over priced but always good . never had any issues here . service has always been good .	3143
0	came in for a full set with shellac 2 days ago and 2 nails are already chipped . i am on vacation from work so have n't done much to cause a chip . poor work done by one of the male nail technician . none of my nails are evenly shaped or match length with other hand . when i told him that it did n't look right during session he continued to tell me `` it will look fine at the end '' i paid 65 $ for a acrylic full set i do n't want something that will look `` fine '' i want something that will look good for this extreme price i 'm paying . will never return .	2148
1	awesome place , and the servers are really nice . they advised me and warned me not to try the tangier 's and what did i do ? i thought of it as a challenge and i tried that s*** . strong stuff , i fell on my ass . good chill place and i heard it gets crazy on the weekends .	2073
1	fuku burger , ya did it again ! this time with a new location . i did n't know they opened up this location until the owner , colin , informed me himself through my last review ! i love how much more convenient this location is . the interior is super cute with local art on the walls . i 'm pretty glad i came in around 11pm because i could only imagine this tiny place getting super packed during lunch/dinner rush . we ordered the buta and kinoko burgers and they were yummy as usual , plus the jazz fries ! like i said in my other review , if you 're into sauceyyyyy flavorful burgers , you 'll love it ! !	964
1	brett did blond highlights today for me today . everyone was super nice & the color & cut came out great .	916
1	we went here based upon the recommendation of my son . we were looking for booties for both our dogs ; upon entering the store we were greeted by the most pleasant young lady named jasmine . she not only showed us what they had , explained the differences and even tried them on my dogs to make sure they fit . this saved us from making any mistakes purchasing the wrong size . she then took the time to help my husband fit a harness for his little dog . prices are a little high but the service makes up for it . and jasmine should be commended for her customer service . definitely will come back	1775
0	i 've been waiting over an hour for a oil change , i asked them to change my rotors since my car is making noise . i go back there to check on my car and and they have n't even drained the oil ! ! ! unbelievable never again . i do not recommend	1619
0	horrible . i came here today with the intent of opening an account . first , this branch does n't even have pamphlets . second , because they do n't have pamphlets i was told i 'd have to speak to someone , fine , except i was waiting 30 minutes to almost an hour - and still waiting.. until now . if someone has to wait that long just to ask questions - i do n't even want to imagine how long it 'll take for other services . that 's okay , i 'll take my business elsewhere .	2761
0	filthy , filthy rest room . what does that say about the food prep area ?	606
1	chicken burrito was on of the best i 've had . food is quite spicy . service was quick but food was just warm .	1305
0	they scan items twice , when there is only 1 . they also lie about sales and overcharge , scamming people out of money .	2445
0	worst atms ever ... they 've got to be the first atm ever made . calibration on the touch screen is totally off so it will repeatedly cancel your transaction when you hit done , because cancel is right next to it . also , the absolute slowest atms on planet earth..which is why canceling your transaction is a huge deal . trust me , even iraq has brand new atms i 've yet to see here . i 've gotten so frustrated , i finally went inside and closed the account i was trying to deposit in .	2760
1	i see kristen for tattoo removal and she is amazing ! she made such a difference in my tattoo after one session . i had had four prior sessions somewhere else and the results were very different .	366
1	always friendly , they always greets you , clean , lots of tables , right next to safeway	725
1	there was a black lady servicing the pharmacy drive thru . she was awesome ! ! very polite and was very personable . i think the other staff in the pharmacy need to take personality lessons from her !	758
0	beer selection is best in town and this is my local , but we rolled through for an after-work pint tonight and found out they no longer have tsn or sportsnet . not sure what 's going on but it 's ridiculous . ended up at belfast love to enjoy some local craft beer with the game on . bring back the sports , barhop !	3039
1	this is a good , clean chevron with slightly more spacious stalls for filling up your car . nice location on se corner of bell & 75th ave .	3395
1	we rented a couple of road glides for a trip to hoover dam , everything worked just like it should , the charges were exactly what they told us they would be . this has by far been my best motorcycle rental experience i have had . the girls in the front were very helpful in fitting us with some riding glasses . the next time i am in vegas i will be back .	3078
1	i enjoyed the time my husband and i spent there . meant to have a long island ice tea as i hear they are `` the bomb '' . i played it safe with beer and a tequila shot : ) loved the music , had a blast playing pool . my husband enjoyed playing pool also , is n't into loud bass pumping music like iam : ) because it is in asu town expect a college crowd ready to party . it was slow when we arrived around 10pm but was pretty crowded by midnight . btw they take checking id 's very seriously .	1966
0	the prices are high , and the cleaning is as expected for this place , but the service is unfortunate . i expected them to call when my wedding reception dress was ready to pick up . never received a call . i had to arrive at the store to find out it was ready to be picked up a month ago .	2070
0	really disappointed ! ordered 3 shutters on october 31st . was told 3 weeks . today they were supposed to be delivered and installed . john called to say they were n't in the warehouse . he tracked them down and now they ca n't be installed until next tuesday because he 's booked . that 's the downside in dealing with small companies . not enough people .	475
1	very nice salon . it was my first time coming here . $ 40 for a gel manicure is pretty pricey , but they did a good job . i just was n't expecting $ 50 for a manicure after tip .	2390
1	one of the best nail salon experiences i 've had . they were super welcoming and gave me a tour of the salon while i waited . the salon is designed beautifully and there 's endless nail polish options . christine ended up doing my nails and they turned out exactly how i wanted them ! she 's very sweet and precise with her work . i have super flimsy and short nails so she gave me recommendations on what manicure would be best for them and she will be working with me on growing/strengthening them . i do n't think my experience could have been any better , i 'll definitely be going back .	2008
0	if i could give this credit union a zero i would . the customer service is terrible , they go around in circles with your concerns . their fees are worse than major banks , good thing my primary account is chase , which has better service and fees , i will be most definitely closing my account ass soon as possible .	1141
0	2 stars because the macarons were definitely not fresh . it was super hard and crunchy .	1160
1	amber padilla did my hair after it being done very terribly at another salon and she left it exactly the way i wanted . she spent 3 1/2 hours only on me and i loved that . most salons are bouncing around with clients but she did n't . the whole salon was so clean and very chic . i recommend 100 %	2577
0	i have been attempting to contact my property manager for almost a week now to no avail . my car was supposed to be towed within 24 to 48 hour for expired tags , which is understandable . however , i fixed the issue and tried to communicate that to them . its been a week to the day , and they just towed my up to date car for no reason . this is absolutely unacceptable ! definitely not professionals at all . please save yourself the headache and look else where .	925
1	amazing pizza . great lasagna ... and the wings are amazing as well . this place is tucked away but worth the hunt . pizza was tossed right in front of us so we knew it was real fresh dough .	773
0	the special pho is not really special . even when we asked for the right combination for the four of us , they brought out two small bowls that can only feed two of us .	947
1	this was my second time bringing of my kids to this facility . both times we had an excellent experience . the front office staff was friendly . the wait time was reasonable and the provider was professional , kind , and did a thorough examination . i was very pleased with my experience and would definitely come back and recommend their facility to others .	3116
0	ruined my brows . she took off my entire arch on one brow and made them extremely uneven . after i let them grow out she just ruined them . never going back , they do n't care at all how you feel or about you liking how they come out , she just rushed thru them and completely changed the shape of one of my brows after i said all i wanted was them cleaned up	2062
0	i have no idea what the owner 's problem is , but he 's incredibly rude . his wife , on the other hand is super nice ( an odd mix ) . great space , rude owner and the coffee is average .	816
0	ridiculous . checked out there images on google before going in which had a picture of really long acrylic nice nails so me having my long nails decide to try them out . i walk in and have a seat and as the women looks at my nails she tells me she does n't know how to do long nails ... so i ask if the other employee can and she says no ? what kind of nail shop can only do short nails and not long .	3682
1	07.14.18 i was so impressed that nathan responded to my after hours call right away to subscribe medication for my pain . he may have saved my life . nathan- you are a life saver .	3349
0	the female bartender is extremely rude . the customer next to me waited 10 minutes to even be greeted , and them he said `` ma'am '' , and she turned her back to him and put her hand up . i have n't even tried the food , but there is no excuse for poor customer service .	201
0	i had really high hopes for this place because of its reviews but my gel did n't even last a week . my nail tech painted the gel onto my cuticles . i 'm sure they do awesome acrylics and dip but not the place to go for gel . it should n't be lifting from the bottom .	1316
1	i went in for sone last minute hiking supplies for my visit to red rock . the staff was super friendly and their selection of items for each sport was beyond ny expectations . prices are higher than if you shop on amazon but when you need last minute stuff , this is the place to go .	3760
0	this place is ridiculous . i waited in the waiting room for 3 hours before being seen . when i went up and asked where i was on the list they told me i already checked out when i was never even called back . numerous people that came in after me left before me . the front staff was very unorganized and rude and unhelpful . all around one of the worst doctors offices i have ever been to and i still have yet to be seen by a doctor . this is going on 4 hours .	2517
0	they certainly do n't blow their budget on air conditioning . come here if you want to play in 80+ temps .	3837
1	we had a community event recently to watch the super bowl there and the location was a good choice . i especially liked the layout with all the screens conveniently located and visible from everywhere . while nothing was particularly unique about the pub , there was nothing noticeably wrong with it either . the service and food were good and reasonably priced . while the place is not deficient in any obvious way , i have not had any `` wow '' moments on my first visit . verdict : this is a pub you want to go to get drunk . it does the job , and does it well . what it lacks is flavor and uniqueness .	97
1	i 'm a starwood platinum , so i get around to alot of sheraton properties . this property , while old , showed some signs of updating . it 's a great location in terms of freeway access and the grounds are quite nice for being located close in phoenix . front staff was very helpful . the room was nice with a big plasma but like most hotels , no hd programming . not sure why you have a great tv and only offer standard channels . overall , i 'd stay here again . i would think it 's more of a business hotel but it 's also a great central location to explore phoenix from .	3166
0	linda the lady who answers the phone hung up on me after i asked to speak with the office manager . these offices are terribly run with unprofessional workers . i would advice the owner to get new faculty after customers dealing with such terrible services .	2303
0	poor service , cold food ... and did i say , poor service ? there are too many food options in charlotte , so good luck dolce and buyer beware .	563
1	we went here on a brewery tour along with great lakes and fat head . this was by far our favorite stop ! by the time we got there , we were n't the most sober bunch , but the tour was great , they took the time to answer our numerous questions , and were very accommodating of our group . highly recommend !	1110
1	this is my favorite location to go to because the staff is always in such a great mood . i 'm a morning person and when i 'm still a little groggy they are so upbeat and just seem to change my mood for the better . an added bonus -- they make my coffee taste better than when i order at any other location .	2206
1	fast service and super friendly staff ! very clean restaurant . the food was great ! i prefer the chicken strips from bush 's over kfc or raising canes . we will definitely be back .	862
0	nice guy , everything was fine , then i got a call from the dealer where he dropped my car . the front wheels with a huge scratch . did not take ownership of the damage . bad bad behavior	2678
0	i was lured in by the sign that said they had beignets . i 've had beignets in new orleans at cafe du monde and cafe beignet . these were nothing like those . i expected something light and airy with a crispiness from the fryer . these were heavy and dense and seemed baked . very disappointing .	1160
0	i was n't impressed with this nail salon at all . i tried it because there was a groupon but i will not be returning . i found the nail salon tech to be a little rude and no one ever answers the phone .	196
1	just what i was looking for ! a spot in front of the tv to watch the kings , a good appetizer and salad , and a nice server that leaves you alone ... .until you need something ! ... 5 stars on all counts . i was by myself and felt comfortable and felt i got a good meal at a very reasonable cost !	717
0	this place is a rip off . they charged my twice what it should have cost and it took forever . big mistake .	2210
0	had the achar-achar , and it was quite good . however , the service here was horrible . even though we had a large group with us , they were treating us quite horribly . service was slow as well .	1425
1	love this place ! so much fun ! i would say come before noon for the best prices ! lots of different games you can play that are fun . the food is delicious and the drinks are awesome ! i would recommend this to anyone who has n't gone here . so much fun !	1483
0	have been doing weekly aquatots visits and have been happy until today . did a makeup visit with alina and did not get the same experience . my son was shaking cold and off on his own during this class . she did n't seem to be attentive at all . after awhile we decided to end the class early and pull him out . we asked her about him shivering cold and all she did was acknowledge yes he was . well it would be good if you did something about it instead of let him shiver . the pool area seemed cold as well not sure if they were experiencing issues with the heater etc .	2521
0	i 'm giving 2 stars because the service was horrible . our waiter was grumpy from the beginning . slow to take drink orders and seemed annoyed . once we finally ordered , our food did n't take too long and was good . the waiter never came back to check on us and i had to ask the hostess and bus guy when we needed refills , etc . we waited for our bill for 15 minutes .	192
0	i am a twenty years plus journeyman painter in the valley and the last time i went there the customer service was horrible in every way so i stayed away and went to other competitors that give 5 star customer service . i went back today just to give them another chance and not only did it actually get worse they acted as if i did not even existed because i was only buying a small amount of paint ! very disappointing ! ! ! i am not happy leaving this place !	2160
1	absolutely love this place . we have been going there for years and never had a bad experience . the food is always prepared the way we want it . staff is friendly and great margaritas .	560
0	it 's like a southern breakfast place - without the good food or charm . very very average food , service was average ( which has been consistent in the three times i visited ( i thought maybe they would get their act together - no not happening ) always some minor mistake . friendly and untrained , the kind you can not really blame the wait staff - but you can blame management . just go someplace else , for the price - food quality and wait staff , it 's a disaster zone .	1319
0	the food was alright . the deep fried tofu with spinach , the short ribs are okay , and lobster hai gow . the prices are def over priced . the peiking duck was super dry . if you really want good dim sum , you need to go to real deal chinese food places like uptown markham . if you are a foreigner and do not know about dim sum , then sure . btw the tea is $ 3.50 per person ... what madness is this hahah	1441
1	you know you are getting old when you see the type of clothes you used to wear in high school and college are now featured in the vintage section . need neon windbreakers , buffalo plaid shirts , and mom jeans-you 're in luck as they have them . ragstock is a great place to get inspired for a halloween outfit or to waste an hour perusing through their eclectic collection .	1045
1	ricky carter , this is the man you need to talk to . he is completely relatable , not pushy what so ever , and made this the easiest and most comfortable car buying experience of my life . i got my incredible hyundai santa fe that had the lowest price and milage i could find at other hertz , enterprise and dealership locations . the dealership could n't even get close to the price i paid at this hertz ( $ 2,000 more ) even at the other `` no haggle , no stress '' locations i never felt so at home . i could n't imagine a better car buying experience .	290
1	ordered online for delivery . it was simple and they have 5 % off right now . delivery was fast and the food is fantastic .	459
1	we used them about a year ago , but it 's about time i leave them a great review . beat other estimates , some by half ! excellent customer service , quick , and most importantly- they put the seams in the best places . they have a scrap yard , perfect for bathrooms and i plan on using them next year for bathroom remodels on a budget !	2090
0	what a tourist trap ! my dad has fond memories of coming here when he 'd visit his hometown of pittsburgh , and every time we 've been back in the last decade it 's been quieter and crappier than the last . i think this is the last time for us . there are very few stores and they are not so great , as a whole . unless you plan on checking out the incline , i 'd skip this destination . it 's just boring .	3152
0	second time been there , the first time was ok the second time was horrible have to wait . my husband pedi was almost done when whatever his name is started doing my pedi and he was done at the same time my husband pedi was done he did n't even take the time to do a good job it 's not like i was asking for a free service then he painted my to nails and it was horrible had to ask him to take off .	544
1	definitely a experience , felt like the $ 15 a person was a little pricey . but the night was nice and me and my friend got to walk around and see all the `` guilds '' lots of shopping costumes and food . would come back next year .	2665
0	zero stars if possible ! my husband and i came on 3/25 for a early dinner . it was our first time and excited to give it a try about 10 minutes after leaving we both became violently ill . turns out we both had food poisoning . not sure which dish is the culprit . i had the pho special , my husband had the bun bo hue . together we shared : grilled pork rolls , banh xeo , and a thai iced tea . it was completely empty when we went at 4 pm . will not be back .	172
0	i have been looking for a car online . i saw that sands kia had what i was looking for at a good price . so we drove down . i told the salesman the car i saw on line and the price . he said we should go for a test drive . he went inside to get the key . we got back and sat at his desk . after a while they come back and tell us that we do not have the correct price . instead of $ 11,500 they said it was $ 14,000 . how dishonest . we had the correct online price as of that morning roughly two hours earlier .	624
0	the service department is the worse . i can stand in front of the counter for 20 minutes . the staff shuffles papers , moves keys and no one acknowledges me . i receive the invisible man treatment . during an oil change , fluids are supposed to be checked and replenished . i 've been low on windshield washing fluid , power steering and brake fluid over the past year . for anyone who uses them good luck . you either have a death wish or are optimistic . i have tried to complain to management . no one calls or responds to email .	1890
1	been coming here for the past 2 years for any car issues i have faced . the customer service is amazing every time . the facility is always clean and organized . and the work is always done correctly , in a timely manner , and they always shoot for the cheapest prices . definitely going to continue coming here !	2146
1	this place was great for what we needed . its close to the sf giants stadium , walking distance to old town , and a free breakfast . we had a 2 queen bed room , and the nice thing is there is a separate sitting room . there are double doors that separate the two rooms . there was a couch , fridge , microwave and an additional tv in that room . the free shuttle within a 3 mile radius is really nice . we also used it to take us back to the airport . it was $ 15 per person . i would stay here again .	3832
0	this store is not clean and the employees are pretty rude . management is n't much nicer . i avoid it at all costs . the petco on metropolitan is a much better option if you want to shop at a big box pet supply store .	514
1	just bought a new car from arrowhead honda . got a fair price and the sales team was amazing . enjoyed the process love the car . especially enjoyed our sales rep m.j . he was professional while being funny and engaging us in the process . we will definitely buy from them again .	2210
1	nick was our mattress salesperson . i usually find salespeople kind of annoying . nick was really helpful and did n't pressure us at all .	401
1	hey all this place is great ! i needed a oil change in a bad way and these guys hooked me up . they got me in and out on a lunch break and you ca n't beat the yelp deal !	3052
1	awesome time ! frank and cody are great . the scooters are fun and the views are amazing !	3256
0	had a small misunderstanding with a service advisor so i spoke with cj , the service manager . cj was very understanding and corrected the issue right away . cj offered us 100 $ off a light bar for the inconvenience . the appointment was supposed to be 4 hours . at 5.5 hours i called and they said it would be another 1.5 hours . i would have like a phone call if your going to be 3 hours late on my vehicle . brought the truck in at 830 and got it back at 1630 . they did n't put the front grill on right and it squeaks going down the road . have to bring it back down there again .	307
0	still upside down on this scam . do not go here ! they ripped me off on a trade-in in 2011 . i lost over $ 15,000 .	3065
0	lots of overpriced open boxed items . some will like it , but i was n't a fan . why in the heck would you buy anything electronic from this place with no warranty is beyond me .	2186
0	i 've been to the one on windmill ( really small place ) and i 've gotten food delivered from the tropicana location . bad service from both and the food was okay . nothing special not really worth going to . you can probably find better food elsewhere for the same price .	1361
0	not impressed . ordered chicken fingers and they were fried way too long and taste terrible . seems like they.were fried in old/rancid oil .	1397
0	the absolute worst place . consistently bad food and even worse service . today i purchased the `` watermelon lemonade '' which was 6oz for 4 $ and was spoiled . it had a sour rotten taste . i 'm done with this place . 8/10 times i 've gone in , it 's been bad service or overpriced crappy food . not going back here ever .	390
0	i have come to the stadium several times in the past few yrs.. but i am unsure if i would return because mainly the music they play . absolutely inappropriate for a family event with music talking about having sex , and drug references .. i was completely offended and untill it changes to a more family atmosphere i will not return	2199
0	this place needs a good manager . been here a few times and find the staff are just chaotic , does n't seem like they 've been given good training even though they are courteous - who does what is not clear . also do n't work well under pressure and get defensive with customers . weird . food is fine .	39
0	royal blue pool service just stopped coming , no notice , no calls . they would not return my calls to find out why no one was coming . i had them for a few years at a different house and did an ok job , just not very reliable when they say they will be there . and to just stop coming that 's just wrong !	1376
1	loved the server and california chicken club was filling , bit overpriced but would go back again	839
1	my son 's vehicle was totaled in vegas and was taken over to ewing storage till we had a chance to get it , as we live out of state . i had the pleasure of meeting barb over the phone who was so very helpful with the entire process which seemed daunting trying to deal with it , with the car being over 500 miles away . she was so patient and helpful as we dealt with navigating and dealing with the third parties insurance company . she answered all my questions helped with potential salvage and just provided overall great customer service . all document were sent to the insurance without any problems ! she is the epitome of customer service .	3654
0	wanted to replace my rugs . appx . 900 sq ft. called and person at the store arranged an appointment for an estimator to come to the house . the person was a no show . i have a problem with retailers setting appointments for services and staff does not show up .	439
0	two words do n't bother . ted 's is bland tasteless food . i asked for easy rice and still got a large handful on my burrito , it was also dry af maybe they forgot to add sauce then asked if i wanted fresh or packaged ginger on the side i of course opted for the fresh which turned out to be the pink pickled variety which in my opinion is horrible . the best part of the meal was the hawaiian chips .	1354
1	calling all vegans and others with dietary restrictions ! the owner is an absolute dear and will make any food to your specifications . this is one of my family 's favorite restaurants . the owner made me a vegetable soup which was delightful . for my lunch today i ended up getting spicy vegetables and tofu . the sauce itself was n't very spicy , but the chili peppers in it perked it right up .	1312
0	i am rating the retail store only . i am a huge fan of the show and maybe had higher expectations when planning to get away from my group to check put the retail store . it was a total disappointment . almost nothing in the store . no tanks filled with fish for sale . just a dusty little place with a couple hats and shirts . old custom tanks from the shows are there empty except the hot rod . no one greeted us . no one acknowledged us at all . really i have no idea why it 's even there . total waste of time and money in can fees to get there and back .	2440
1	just tried this place out saturday . totally fabulous ! ! i did n't have an appointment but needed my underarms waxed . the receptionist informed me that my wax would be free since i was a first time customer . heather was my wax specialist and she was awesome ! ! she explained the entire process to me and i barely felt any pain . wish i had tried this place sooner !	3844
1	yay , they 're back . i 'm a fan of this store . i 've bought many wigs here for a low price . hence , i dont feel too bad destroying some of them for costumes and such . they carry cute lil hair accessories , hair dye , etc . the ladies are very helpful when it comes to finding a particular brand or wig . right now , their store isnt quite what it used to be . its a soft opening ( not all merch is up on shelves or displayed ) . im sure it will be back to where it was .	3676
1	overall good experience . i would say the savings from internet purchase that i would have made in the end is a wash because spencers delivered , installed , and disposed for me . they were prompt and good to work with . the store music needed to be toned down . it was distracting and was more appropriate for a dance club .	3784
1	i loved this place ! ! ali was super fast and made me feel extremely comfortable i will definitely be back ! my sister came with me to and she is also coming back ! we love ali cat !	1426
1	if your honda needs service this is the place . come and ask for tom in the service department . he will not bs you and he likes to take care of his customers . he is the only person i will deal with when i come here .	2210
1	i usually get the breakfast combo which comes with waffle , eggs , bacon/sausage and coffee . not bad for $ 5.95 . do n't forget the stamp card .	580
0	yeah this place was interesting for sure . the prices were above average . the glass was cheap . the worker was super strange and beyond awkward . they do n't take cards unless you spend like 10 bucks which is ridiculous ... i mean it is 2016 . the shop has a selection of jewelry ( very random i know ) and you top it off , they also sell porno videos ... why ? idk	591
0	this was my first time ordering a cake from here and it will be my last . i ordered a cake for a very special occasion , i asked for a beige cake with white flowers , pink and mauve flowers . the cake had red flowers ! ! ! not to mention , the cake was not done well , there were air bubbles all over ! when i picked it it , the employee said there were no managers . i 've been trying to reach a manager and have had no luck . it is now 3 weeks and no call back . worst customer service ever ! save your money and go elsewhere . please .	868
0	worst tanning salon every . i have been with this company since they opened . this location . has the oldest beds that never work . the owners are never in town and they have many issues with employees . current issue it 's my second time trying this location again and the employee emily is very rude and not helpful . i like this company but only the sahara location . if u ca n't go to that location then do n't even bother there are better tanning salons that have working beds and not rude staff . i have talked to management several times and nothing is getting resulted . save ur money and go somewhere else	2714
1	if you hate campechano 's tacos , you do n't know tacos ... . ; ) kidding aside , this place has some of the best carnitas i 've ever had . juicy , unctuous , with the right ratio of crispy bits . also , pescado- omfg . crispy batter , pickled cabbage a great foil to the fish and avacado crema ... i saw the face of god in these tacos . hyperbolic ? just barely . seriously , if you 're kicking around the queen west area , go get some tasty eats at campechano . tacos and a damn fine margarita will be the cure to whatever crap this city may have thrown at you during the day .	1469
1	the food was absolutely delicious . steaks cooked to perfection ! the flavors were very bold and let u wanting more . the atmosphere of this restaurant is very romantic yet casual . we have decided to make this our regular anniversary spot for a while . thank you for a wonderful evening .	951
1	this is my first time staying in doubletree hotel . the front desk is very friendly especially offering you a warm gooey chocolate chip cookie . the room is really nice and clean . a lot of details and attention on room setups . the most important is the bed . it 's really comfortable with nice soft pillow and soft fluffy mattress . the sitting chair is normal hotel chair which is hard . the only negative i have is the tv remote that does n't work well . the place was packed on saturday night . definitely will go back there to stay when i am around akron .	880
1	after a very long day of dealing with my idiot insurance company `` progessive '' phenomenal towing came to our rescue ! sergio our tow truck driver was absolutely amazing . and the guys at dispatch were a tremendous help ! i will be recommending this company to anyone in need of efficient towing ! ! ! thanks guys you rock ! ! ! !	2010
1	went in for friday late lunch and were treated like royalty ! ! ! our server , antonio , was fantastic , attentive , and patient . the cadillac margarita was yummy and hit the spot ! our food was very good , tasty , salsa was delicious too . would highly recommend this place	882
1	this is the cleanest korean bbq resto i 've been so far..food tasted okay thoi ordered that tofu soup was good ... and i much appreciate it when the waitress asked me if i want egg , she then give me fresh egg on the side ... cl	435
0	rude workers do not work in customer service and be rude to customers ! ! ! idiots i will not ever be returning ! ! ! ! !	2409
1	godly . enough said . 6 time all star , multiple gold glove winner , and 3 time nl mvp candidate .	2005
0	this place is a dump ! all appliances are very old and do n't work right . maintenance has not showed up for scheduled appointments more than once ; when they finally did show they could n't fix it first try . office staff is rude at times and they are all very challenged ... do n't expect any kind of help from them . and they will take your deposit no matter how you leave the place . worst run complex i have ever lived in . do n't waste your time here .	2831
0	very cool place to see a show , however the bathrooms were deplorable when i visited on 11/7/15 . the toilets has standing water all around them , the sinks were n't draining & there was no soap or sanitizer in any of the restrooms ... so you know the food & drink vendors were n't washing hands while handling our concessions . i wish i would have known everything was cash only too . still a phenomenal show , sound was good & not a bad seat in the house . really loved the free parking too ! if they only address the restrooms , everything would be great & i would definitely come back .	3868
0	i checked in online and when i got there i was told that they are closed already even if they accepted the check in and the rude staff , just walked away and did n't say anything else .	3232
0	my son had an appointment and woke up not feeling well so i called to cancel and was told i will be charged a fee . what a ridiculous way to run a business . you should be concerned about the health and well-being of patients , instead of making money . sorry to cut down on spreading germs . will not be returning here . scheduling staff was unfriendly and lacked compassion .	1541
0	pretty bad pedi . tech was 10 min late for appt . then water was cold . bench seats extremely uncomfortable one gal went back and forth between my friend and i. pedi was bad . highly not recommend	1370
1	i have not been to this mall in ages ! it has changed and has a facelift ( nice ) . they have a parking structure , costco , etc ... . we walked through the food court area . nice , clean , and lots of tables/chairs to sit . in the mall , they have many rest areas so your feet can get a break . = ) i am not sure if they let dogs in , but someone was walking a huge dog ? ? ?	2815
1	i was at mayo hospital in phoenix and had tried best gluten free cupcakes from gigi 's ! the frosting is sweet but when you rarely ever have treats it was well appreciated i preferred the chocolate to the wedding cake but indeed i ate both a day apart .	2024
0	sushi is quite good , but the rest of the buffet is awful ! we were charged $ 3 more because lobster was on the menu , but it was gross . i wo n't return .	165
0	i had the worst experience with customer service while shopping for plants at ecostems . the owner exhibits very self-entitled behaviour , and becomes easily confrontational with the patrons of his shop . my plants from here are beautiful , but so are my plants from everywhere else .	2585
1	i 'm assuming family owned . the children helped their parents which i thought was cute . the store is really cute and their menu looks delicious . i tried the pistachio bar and the banana bread milkshake , they were good ! the owner is really friendly . i 'm not a huge fan of certain almond milk ( i only like one brand so far ) , so next time i might ask for no almond milk in my shake . i would come back to try other items on the menu .	1134
1	shout out to sandy for excellent customer service every time i 'm in the store ! always very helpful .	3411
0	the service was very friendly and they were quick to offer samples on our first visit there . i 'm not a huge frozen yogurt fan , but after reading the 5 star reviews here , i thought i 'd give it a shot . i had the pomegranate with dark chocolate balls , pumpkin granola and coconut . it would have been better in a smaller portion , and i thought it was overpriced at $ 5 for a small cup that was nothing amazing .	3335
1	the mecca of photography in montreal . everything else is a gift shop . even the greeters know about photography here . you can go here as an amateur or as a full fledged pro , they have it all . the only thing missing ( or that i have n't seen ) is a book section .	1809
1	i love this nail salon . they are very friendly and attentive . they make the experience fun . my nails turned out greeeeeeat . i 'm moving across town but this will still be my nail salon . you travel for good service .	3260
1	i typically do n't go here for anything more than a bucket of bagels with cream cheese , but this time we stopped by for some breakfast sandwiches and coffee before a road trip . i had the nova lox sandwich on an asiago bagel , omg so good ! the lox was very tasty and not too smokey flavored and it had just the right amount of cream cheese . i also had an iced coffee with white mocha which was a bit sweet , but overall very tasty . i 'll definitely have to get here more for their other sandwiches and lunch options . very friendly & quick service too !	477
0	beyond disappointed ! too tired tonight to write a full blown rant , after 13 long hours the finished product looks horrible , i am literally in tears i 'm so disappointed . i could n't understand most of what the contractor was trying to explain , i think he said the company did n't send him with enough material to finish , no clear plan for returning to fix this mess . i will call empire tomorrow .	2611
0	i got to neos 10 minutes early , and was told they were running late , that there were 2 clients ahead of me . then , after waiting for 45 minutes for my dysport injections , the lady came out to me and told me `` you are not going to believe this , our dysport shipment did n't come in today '' . why could n't she have told me that when i got there 10 minutes early for my appointment . extremely disappointed in the unprofessional-ism of the place . she told me she would call me to reschedule , and you guessed it . no call . must be nice to have so many clients that you can blow them off !	2498
1	although all party city 's transform into halloween stores each season this one seemed to have everything . even more then party usaor black cat . i went the day before halloween so everything was everywhere but they had all the final components i had been on the hunt for . there did seem to be a lack of staff but check out went quickly	1882
0	wow , this place is overpriced . i only stopped in because i was in the area , happened to see it , and someone actually recommended it . a friend and i still spent a decent amount of time browsing and not once were we acknowledged by the salesclerk at the counter on what was clearly a personal call . we were the only two customers in the store . we were on our wait out before she even asked if we had any questions . of course she had concluded her phone call at that point . if i 'm going to overpay for supplements i might as well go to gnc , at least they are friendly .	3691
1	david hugasian , the person on duty at the counter was superb ! there was a line of 8 to 10 customers that he was handling by himself with no back up pleasantly and efficiently . if the review was for him alone i would have given him six or seven stores . i deducted a star because of enterprises in efficient way of staffing . it took me , literally , 40 minutes to get to the front of the line due to understaffing . but not for david , i would never use enterprise again .	2345
1	great store ! very clean & super friendly staff . great sales and good discounts for donating . we shop here at least every other week for this or that ... clothes , books , jackets , dvd 's on & on ... .	2178
1	kenneth was super nice . like , super nice . i said i did not need a chaser back for my drink because `` i 'm not a pussy . '' he brought me one anyway . it was very nice of him not to emasculate me . 5 out of 5 stars .	1966
0	please do n't bring your brand or expansive shoes here ! ! ! they ruined my christian louboutins and than the owner was yelling at me and say get the fu ... out of here ! ! ! just asked to change the bottom little thing ... seriously , i 'm a 5 ' women he yelled at me get the f.. here ! i 'm glad i did n't give them my other shoes to fix ! they ruined my favorite pair already	2114
1	went apartment shopping and finally my wife and i decided to rent on this property . i must say after a bunch of bad leading agent encounters it was utmost refreshing to be greeted with a staff full of smiles . ashley and kala were just so warm , we felt very comfortable . we were taken one tour , the floor plans were spacious and the grounds seemed very well taken care of and the info given especially with the move in costs fees was very clear . make sure to talk to ashley or kala they will take care of you . thank you guys so much for your help .	1610
0	big store , bad customer service . they dont know the products . how am i gon na find a product if not even they where they are , or what they are . lost 1hr for something that could have taken 20mn	3676
0	the food is great , but we waited 35 minutes past out reservation time , and the table was uncomfortably cold and so dark that we had to use cell phone light for the menu ! the manager ended up bringing out complementary desserts at the end to makeup for the wait and poor service , but we wo n't be back .	487
0	this store is awful . the dressing rooms are hot and dirty , the employees never greeted me or asked if i needed anything until i got till the register , no one knew where anything was , employees lacked common courtesy and training , and the bathrooms look like the have n't seen a good cleaning or renovation since the 90s . forever 21 should have stuck with small stores . i will not be shopping at the arrowhead location ever again .	1872
0	what the hell is with these guys ? ? walked in and were told to seat ourselves ... ten minutes went by and no one even said hello . all their servers were avoiding eye contact when we tried to get their attention . my buddy said they racially profile here ( you must be latin ) i thought he was crazy until i experienced it myself . boo to this place for life .	190
0	i have no idea why i ca n't see my own post when i am logged out . is this some kind of corruption between yelp and the business owner ? ? ! ! you would better have an explanation , yelp !	574
0	went to this place cuz everyone was saying it was dank . highly not dank . i left disappointed . ordered three tacos that were not worth the 8 dollars ... average at best . also ordered a carne asada burrito . it was mostly beans and really small . i 've had ones twice as big for a cheaper price . salsa had no flavor . will not be returning	270
1	sometimes you just need to escape the glamour and the crowds of the strip and eat at somewhere cheap and easy . now i 'm not saying you should go out of your way for this place , but it was a great grab and go . the staff was nice and helpful and the food was very quick . it did n't really feel like we were starting to get into the unsavory parts of las vegas . for a carl 's jr. , you wo n't be disappointed .	830
0	not a lot of bikes for sale , mostly schwinn level bikes . few bike accessories , & clothes . rei has more things . limited food menu .	3726
0	the worst experience with the worst people ! they told us our dresses would come in , in february . middle of march still not here . they were the wrong sizes and wrinkled	1298
0	every week its a new problem . cant wait for the contract to be up . switching to vea.coop fiber optics	3459
1	good food and awesome customer service . i went there yesterday with my son for a quick meal . we ordered chicharon bulaklak , quek-quek , isaw and tapsilog and it 's the bomb .	817
1	i went to emily to have my shih-tzu mila groomed at the east side location and i am in love with her haircut . she did such a great job and my dog felt very comfortable with her . i also took my chihuahua lily to get her nails trimmed and she did great as well ! ! usually she wont let me touch her feet but she sat great for emily ! i will definitely be taking my dogs back to her and this place ! highly recommend ! : )	2988
0	i 've been using them for 4 years because of their close proximity to my house but i 've stopped . too many issues the last 6 months with clothes 2-3 days late , items missing , and very inconsistent customer service . the staff turnover is very , very high .	3032
0	très déçu que les déjeuners simple comme deux œufs et une viande soit retirés du menu . déconseillé pour déjeuner sur semaine .	628
0	my nails were done so badly and my acurlics were done soooo poorly . the french tip was always horrible . never . again . the lady even cut me badly with the nail filer !	3338
1	i am , and continue to be , a big fan of this place . the parking lot is very convenient to get into and out from ( just off snow road exit from 71 ) . the people are always nice , the shuttle drivers are quick , the price is right ( $ 8/day ) and it 's nice leaving with a cold bottle of water .	248
0	well ... i went back , this time for dinner , and unfortunately i was less than satisfied . i ordered miso soup and 3 rolls ( cali , alaska , & fotomaki ) . the rolls took 30 minutes to arrive - and the place was not busy - then the taste was not very fresh . hmmm . also much more pricy at dinner . cost of 3 rolls , miso soup , and green tea = $ 26 and change , before tip . service was lacking too . i might come back to give tako one more shot but it wo n't be for a while .	516
1	easily the best bar so far in calgary . the concept is awesome . love that train ticker with the beer selection . it 's simply a memorable place . not sure what the crowd is like on the weekends , but it seems like a mix of suits and locals . have n't tried the food , but it 's only a matter of time .	630
0	my car was due to be ready at 2 . it is now almost 6 . i kindly asked one time for an eta and was yelled at and cursed at in front of a crowded lobby for all to hear . then the mgr justified it by saying that the detail tech has been under a lot of stress and walked away . shocking . danny 's has lost another loyal customer . anthony has a major anger mgmt problem . and his mgr jordan appears to be totally fine with his his employee treating women ( or anyone ) that way . these people are scary thugs .	3123
1	had an early flight and wife and i were hungry . we noticed marathon diner . i must say it was the best we 've had . the big fat greek omelette was amazing . the service and food were all top notch . wish they had one in our home state cause we would be regulars .	6
1	after calling 7 air conditioning supply stores , getting a lot of voicemails and a bad experience with an employee over the phone at lowes , glendale , i was getting desperate but relieved when this store answered their phone ! i received excellent , kind and professional service . and that is big in my book ! i was transferred to parts and they had what i needed and answered all of my questions . thank you !	3155
0	racist & predjudice ! ! me and my friends went in a few times and each time we have noticed the music suddenly changing to reflect our appearance . and not in a flattering way . the music is often controlled by security . stop targeting your customers ! !	1711
0	i have been going here for three years as a self pay . i have never once seen the actual doctor , and wondering if he even exists . i am never greeted by the girls at the front . i always arrive early , but end up being taken back 45 min after my scheduled time . when i get called back and asked why i am there , they are short , rude , and very condescending . i now have insurance and am currently looking for a new doctor . i have never felt so undervalued .	2303
1	rented a car for this location after checking out another rental company in town . the other company was horrible ! i called and spoke to ty at this location and he was awesome ! did n't even have to call anyone else . his customer service was amazing , he stayed in the phone until all of my questions were answered . when i arrived he went over everything and got me on my way quickly . thanks for your help , i will not look at other companies any longer . enterprise is the way to go ! !	2177
0	this place sucks ! i would have given it negative 5 stars if possible ! how can you review the food if you 've been waiting for almost an hour an have barely received your water ! do n't waste your time . servers do n't care and check up on you either !	341
0	i go to this place every six weeks or so on average . most of the time , the whole experience is very good . i noticed they seem to have had a change in management the past few months and i have seen a decline in the quality of therapist . my last massage was done a by a young guy who kept on leaving every 15-20 minutes . he had a very light touch and i like it firmer , which is usually how they have all been in the past . my guy seemed disinterested and distracted during my hour . i 'll try them again , but there are other foot places that are better around this area .	2970
1	it tastes like burrito boyz . it may not the most authentic ( but what do i know ) but its sure tasty . they have flavours like spicy pulled prok and mango chicken along with the usual toppings and sauces . its grilled to a crispy crunchy wrap and served in the paper bag . there is limited seating here and gets busy after 12pm . its an alternative to burgers .	31
1	every single time i have been here i am always treated so nicely and my nails are gorgeous ! love this place !	1272
1	first visit ever , and no regrets . the chef recommended the rabbit , which was the feature for the evening . delicious . it came with fave beans and who knew fave beans were so good ? honestly , watching the kitchen was quite exciting too . finished off with the earl grey creme brûlée . i loved it , though heads up , there 's quite a bit of tea leaves in the shortbread . it 's seriously delicious but it prevented me from falling asleep later.. oops . if i need to come back to calgary , i 'm headed straight here next time ! thanks to the kitchen and waiting staff for being so nice to me !	1079
0	terrible theater ! overpriced snacks ( you know it 's disgusting when they have the nerve to charge 4 dollars and change for bottled water ) , dirty floors and bland staff . the only bright spot is the bathroom .	3680
0	very expensive with less quantity . if you are going for ambience then i would give 4stars but food with the money you spent is not worth it : (	600
1	hands down the best service in town . rob , the manager , did n't try to sell me anything i did n't need which was nice . they even offer free wi-fi and a ride if you need it . sometimes it 's the little things , and car-x seems to get it .	1044
1	i had the pleasure of being referred to this facility by my insurance . i absolutely love this place the staff is so kind hearted and the dr. is very kind and helpful . i would highly recommend this facility . they are also kid friendly .	2629
0	i wanted to bring my parents to a great fusion place and heard about this place . drove all the way from brampton and walked in around 630 to be told that it will be a half hour wait . the lady was really nice and we accepted to wait . after sitting there after an hour and 15 min i finally got frustrated and approached the lady and expressed the long wait and she said that there was another person in front of us . at that point i grabbed my parents and walked out and went to the keg across the street ! ! i could of done that in brampton .	1362
0	the staff is really nice , and it is a cute little shop , but omg flies galore ! flies crawling all over the doughnuts , flies dive bombing all around the store . the only thing this place needs to complete it is jeff goldblum .	1496
1	best pizza in the city..unless you want sicilian style..then hit betos . we ordered and inhaled a medium everything pizza and a half steak half italian hoagie ... .we should have gotten a large and whole hoagies . delicious and the pizza was bubbly hot and fresh out of the oven . i did n't mind waiting as the guys behind the counter were friendly , funny and genuinely fun to talk too . the only reason i did n't give 5 stars is the hoagies could use a little more meat on them ... but still yummy ! pizza crust is perfect ... not too thin , not to thick and crunchy . i ca n't wait til our next camps night ! !	900
0	sadly disappointing . the men are horrible dancers and for the sub par performance you could at least give the poor girls what they came to see ... more skin , sans the white running shoes .	2149
1	well ... it 's air conditioned . i have been there four times over the past 15 years , but the only exhibits i remember are the mirror panel that allows two people to `` swap '' facial features , a water/pipe exhibit ( a water and pipe exhibit , not a water pipe exhibit ) , some spinning thing , some pulley thing , and a place with blocks . last time i went ( the fourth time ) i kinda felt i never needed to go a fifth , unless i had a fifth .	3891
1	solid gym . all types of machines and more than enough treadmills . amazingly i have n't seen it get too busy one time . it 's great having a gym that is n't slam packed .	2285
1	the food here is amazing ! and the staff is incredible . it 's owned & run by a family and they always go out of their way to make sure your experience is enjoyable . it 's hard to find really good mexican food in phoenix ( especially in glendale ) , but this place always delivers great food at good prices and it comes with unlimited free chips & ( delicious ) salsa !	548
1	this place is a hidden gem ! i was craving vietnamese food and found this in the area . we ordered the shrimp spring rolls , so yummy and crispy with a nice dipping sauce . then i got the seafood pho , great broth nice and light , the seafood was perfectly cooked , noodles were good too . and my boyfriend got the crispy seafood noodles , amazinggg they had a light sauce and a nice crunch ! i also had an avocado smoothie , it was not too sweet and very creamy . definitely making this my new spot !	511
0	if you have a perfectly healthy baby i 'm sure this practice would meet your standards . if you have a difficult baby who requires some additional help from a pediatrician , mesa peds is n't for you . the front office staff has never even been especially personable , especially on weekends . my child saw dr. mccleland and her main goal was getting out of the room asap . i understand that a pcp at a practice has a goal of seeing 4 patients every hour , but when you have issues you would think that some additional attention could be paid to help solve your child 's problems .	3893
0	love the automated response from management obviously no one is actually doing anything at this company as all they do is put boilerplate responses to these reviews . and i 'm sure the response to this review will be the same boilerplate response as all reviews , which just proves my point .	3920
0	do n't store anything valuable here . several units broken into and no alarm system , no way to catch thieves or have any hope of ever getting your stuff back . not secure !	2065
0	amenities are lovely and it is a joy not having to be responsible for electric/trash services/etc , but the response to neighbors frequently breaking nrs 40.2514 has been mediocre . security guards laugh it off and filing a formal complaint with the front desk has led to nowhere . as people who would n't disturb a fly , mom and i deserve better . so do all of those that want quiet . corporate contact information would be much appreciated .	2674
1	small little nail shop , nice and quiet . came in for eyebrows and a manicure and both turned out good . the hand massage i got with my manicure was awesome . reasonably priced . i 'll probably return again .	415
0	rude staff . keep taking phone call as if the customers do n't exist . changing battery takes 45 minutes .	2542
1	i have had penny electric work on several issues for my home and business . i have never been disappointed , they 're extremely knowledgeable efficient and friendly . one visit after coming to my house the issue was so simple they did n't even charge me because it was a two minute fix . they are locally owned so support the local economy ! i highly recommend them !	1867
1	arrived in the middle of the night/early morning and was checked in early and given an upgrade to a stunning room with panoramic views , was right in front of the cn tower , and could see the skyline and also the lake . everyone there was extremely nice . the concierge was very helpful in guiding us with activities , the room service was delicious and staff very kind , the soco kitchen was great and they even had whiskey sampling . my stay was amazing , and when i visit toronto again i will definitely choose delta !	1020
0	did not have a fabulous experience . i took my car in for a wash with 2 intact license plates . left with one mangled nearly falling off . instead of offering to fix the plate i was offered a free license plate holder . as if i would advertise for them after this disappointing experience . i will not be back !	2198
1	just had the sunday morning special today which was peach cobbler pancakes with ice cream and granola . what a treat . absolutely delicious and others who were dining and saw my choice were all commenting and smiling . try it for yourself . great service and a wonderful friendly place .	418
0	very sad , i was there sunday late afternoon and there were no dancers ? ! there were more guys in there then woman ( there were only about 5 guys in there ) . girls did n't show up until after 8 ... and i only saw 3 ? so , do n't ever go there on a sunday . waste of money . speaking of which it cost $ 40 to get in and that came with 2 free drink tickets .	1779
0	i used to work for skechers in las vegas years ago . everything at this store is the same . except this store is much smaller ! especially the clearance section . i tried on some shoes . and that was it really . we were greeted , but no one checked up on me blah , oh well ...	2087
0	i went here to try the 7day membership pass . you do n't need 7 days to figure out how undeserving of your money this place is ! the girls locker rooms are cold and uninviting , i would n't want to sit on those benches . the yoga room is literally the size of a larger bathroom ( fits about 7 people ) . the teacher was great though , she talked us through it well , although she did n't know how to turn on the small ( plug-in ) portable electric heater that they used in the room . i guess the central heater does n't heat up closets ... thank god they offer the 7 day trial .	465
1	contrary to some of the reviews , it was extremely clean in our room and the service was perfectly friendly and helpful . good price to the hotel right near shopping and restaurants . i would absolutely stay here again . our room temperature was on the warm side , the room was dry .	1680
0	the absolute worst worst venue in the east valley , maybe in all of az . sound sucks , over priced drinks and terrible business ethics for aspiring artists . plus they will no longer have hiphop which is scarce already in az . damn you club red for what you have done to our beloved scene .	17
1	friendly , fast service . drinks and food prepared as requested . friendly baristas and cashier . one party fowl is that they ran out of napkins in one of the dispensers . another not-so-positive comment is that the tables available were not cleaned after previous customers were there .	2417
1	amanda ! ! ! excellent customer service . by far , this is the best vape store in southern nevada . the quality of their juice is beyond amazing . the price ? well , go see them and you 'll be amazed how affordable they are . i highly recommend this vape store to anyone .	2839
0	specializing in hangover-caliber diner food ! if your car broke down here and you needed to eat , this place will not let you down ! the highlights begin and end at the swell lumberjack statue in front of the building .	1319
1	i usually come to pepe 's tacos whenever i crave mexican food . the food is cheap and it 's good quality . the worker 's are friendly and helpful . i ordered 2 carne asada tacos and i did n't realize that it came with chips . i absolutely loved it ! i am a frequent customer and i plan on coming back .	857
0	it 's hard to screw up a mixed drink or a draft so no issues there . if you call a $ 10 bowl of iceberg lettuce , sprinkled with blackberries and goat cheese a culinary delight , then this is your place . my advice ... pass when it comes to eating there .	385
1	go-to place in toronto for a cut . ask for a japanese stylist as they are extremely patient and really take their time to understand what you are looking for . the korean guy with pony-tail and glasses is also quite decent	2181
1	they had exactly what i was looking for ; the staff was really helpful . the store was very busy , and i got a great price . i wish i had asked the girls name , she was awesome .	2480
1	wanted to try the desserts for the first time , enjoyed it very much ! the mango / strawberry waffle was my fave ! would def go again and try out their other desserts .	1182
1	we have been going here for years . great value ! ! ! we love renee ! she is always happy and helpful .	2541
0	stay away ! their customer service is a joke . i booked 4 months in advance and called a week ahead to confirm that my appointment was good to go . they told me i was n't on the calendar ! then i agreed to go another day at another time but then they did n't have the masseuses available for the couple 's massage ! then past all that it took 2 weeks to get a simple $ 99 refund . do n't waste your time or money !	3079
1	i had the best experience ever after having to deal with so much other expenses through sixt . david there was beyond amazing . i would n't have a car for my trip right now if it was n't for him . he made my entire trip hands down . i come to phoenix frequently and i will always come back . thank you so much david i appreciate it more than anything on this trip ! ! !	3595
0	although this store offers a good variety like in other whole food markets , it lacks in hygiene and organization . soup is rarely fresh . seems like it has sat there for a while . cutlery is missing . yesterday i was looking for a lid to my plastic cup , but could not find one . there was no one to help either . will i be whole after i eat food from whole foods ?	433
0	went in for a bouquet for a simple event . browsed their selection in the case and everything available was insanely overpriced . flowers were browning , small and some wilted . went to a heinens a mile down the road and got a bouquet twice the size for less . would not recommend . i 'm all about patronizing local businesses but this seems criminal to charge what they are for what they have to offer .	2281
1	love watching leilas youtube.. she has such an amazing personality.. that 's why i went with her.. she showed up so prepared , with a chair and all . lol..she has an amazing kit which tells me she is a pro . she did such an amazing job i was blown away.. she even brought along a hairstylist that was also amazing.. i had so much fun that day i would definitely recommend her and will be contacting her next time i go out there : )	1922
1	been here twice and the food was on point for a bar . cheap drinks and a cozy atmosphere . the irish spring rolls are friggin delicious , i 'm craving them as i type this .	1510
0	the worst restaurant ever . customers should never eat at this place because you get diarrhea from their food . i had their food on friday and i have been feeling sick with diarrhea since saturday . i vomited 3 or 4 times on saturday and i had to call off from work because of my upset stomach . now my husband got an upset stomach too . we both are still sick from their trashy food . i reported this incident to the manager and he did n't even help . this restaurant needs to close .	398
1	best show in vegas . great performer . she 's definitely a vegas girl . the energy is amazing . totally a show to see .	1771
1	awesome fun . the whole family had a great time . great experience , even for non golfers .	1483
1	excellent mushroom and wild rice bisque and curried apricot and red lentil ! ! awesome communal setting as well . highly recommend	59
1	i have ordered from here numerous times now and they are always prompt and accurate ! not the mention delicious ! i love their pizza and wings ! ! i agree with everyone else and ca n't agree with the low stars . love express pizza .	987
1	hands down the best bake goods i have ever had . not only are the treats awesome but the people running this joint are top notch as well . i will definitely be back .	3135
1	very nice staff , from check in to check out ! cafeteria is great ! we forgot my dad 's cane and the gal that wheeled us down from the 8th floor was so kind to go all the way back and get it ! ! nurses were all very kind to my dad as well !	3214
0	worst customer service with genius bar techs at this store . the appointments are never on time . they are rude , talk over you , and never acknowledge apple product quality issues , it is always the customers fault . i wo n't go back again . i would rather shop at future shop , they provide better cs and extra warranty for the poor quality apple products .	3579
1	it was hard to find . needs to have a sign out front . but i get you want it to look like a normal meat shop . also it was hard mockingbird strangers . some personalities were very strong and would n't listen to your opinions . overall it was challenging and good	1391
0	clearly does n't care about customer service at all . completely okay with customers just putting their purchase down at the checkout and walking out . do n't even bother	2343
0	to start off..the staff is friendly & the doctor is good . but just make sure you have at least 2 hours to kill . i mean..seriously ... i know doctor 's office can get busy but this is the 2nd time here accompanying my mother . at the minimum , plan to sit around & waste 2 hours of your life..waiting .	2312
0	waited an hour to be placed in another waiting room where i was told the doctor would be another 30 min or more . what 's the point of an appointment time . will not be rescheduling . plan to taken hours off work if you go .	2099
0	i came into edgeworkxx on a whim and i was greeted by satan 's mistress herself . i could n't help but notice that shelley had a very negative vibe and spoke down to everyone around her . anytime my wonderful stylist asked her for a second opinion she told me that the colouring i had requested was all wrong and was going to turn out terrible . overall i was extremely turned off by the obvious lack of respect she held for her employees and i absolutely will not be supporting her local business any further .	2
0	my friend took her vehicle to this business last year for 1 problem , but when she picked up her vehicle several more problems occurred she called them back and they picked up her vehicle and kept it for nearly 2 months and refused to give her a receipt and the car has many more problems in addition to the original one still occurring.now the repairs on this vehicle will cost more than the vehicle is worth.this establishment turned this 2002 mercedes c240 into a running garbage can.this place is terrible and we would n't recommend this .	1215
1	sweet owners ! i got the beef bowl a little on the sweet side with lots of onions and the kakiage don mmmm ... japanese omelette with pieces of shrimp tempura all in a miso broth with ramen so hangryyy i ate for two bwahah ; ) i would def come back and eat here some time .	930
1	this store ( and the phoenix location ) is awesome ! i just got a bed there , and i do n't have a truck so the lady working there lent me tools to take it apart so it would fit in my car . she was very helpful and friendly . i 've been to the phoenix one many times since it 's right near my house but the bed was at this location and i 'm glad i went . the store is very cute , clean , and i would say decently priced for the clothes they have . thanks for another great experience : d	2282
0	to the person who thinks my review was dumb . you must work for them or be related to someone who works there . abd yes smiths , ir albertsons would gladly give me a missing item . they like to keep their loyal customers happy . im not a dishonest person and if i pay for something i expect it to be in my bag of items when i get home . im not the one putting the items in the bags the cashier at the store is . the mistake is theirs and the dishonesty is theirs . stick thus in your pipe and smoke it . boy .	541
0	went here for a recent used gear sale `` garage sale . '' i was told there was no reason to come early as they give out tickets at a certain time . well i got there and sure enough there was a line with plenty of people in front of me . luckily i got there a bit early , but i am still pissed i was lied to over the phone . obviously the employees all need to get on the same page . decent location and store though .	1059
1	little baja is one of 3 large pottery and fountain shops in las vegas . they probably have the best selection of both , and if they do n't have it there they can get it . the staff is knowledgeable and helpful . we have recently purchased a large fountain which was placed in our house with a crane ( minimal additional charge ) . the staff set it up perfectly . we could not be more pleased with the service value and professionalism .	1987
0	i ordered the best friend waffle and it was decent , crispy and soft in a good way . however , they undoubtedly put spoiled milk in my thai tea with boba ! unfortunately i got my food through postmates so i could n't do much complaining with out calling but i was extremely disgusted and will not be returning . who knows what else is out of date in their store .	580
0	absolutely worst experience i 've had dealing with my car . do not go here . rude technician cussing about my car and heavy battery . store employees completely unorganized . very disappointing .	360
1	the first time i took my son here , he had gotten a really bad cut elsewhere . not only did they fix his bad haircut , but were great with him . we came today ten minutes before the closed and were in and out with a great haircut . thanks for being great with the little ones ! ! ! ! !	260
0	i had breast augmentation on one breast due to unevenness and liposuction on abdomen . dr. gawley may be okay with breast augmentation but stay away if you want liposuction . from my experience he is not a specialist in this . i was not a large person to begin with but now hate my results . it is as if he did n't do any lipo . his attitude after 3 mos . was that this is my body shape and that 's it . it 's like all communication broke down when he got my money and did the surgery .	3623
1	i had a great experience it was a long one but not by anyone 's fault i was on hold for issues only being handled by calling them in . both store manager and associate helping were great and very knowledgeable . they were patient with my process and gave the best advice on services and devices . will be coming here from now on .	2020
1	i went in for a cracked wisdom tooth and everyone there was so amazing . amber the front desk lady helped me with all my paperwork and greeted me by name and was super friendly . the doctor i saw was willing to take care of my cracked tooth that day . they ended up taking out 3 out of 4 of my wisdom teeth for me that same day at a very affordable price . i will be returning and recommending this office and staff to other people i know .	2079
0	disgusting ! my kids went here with a puncture and driving on the emergency spare wheel as they had to drive 90 miles back up to payson , they arrived 20 minutes before they closed and explained the situation but big o would not help them because they said they where too busy 20 minutes before closing , i 'm not a tire expert but i know it does n't take them 2 minutes to fix a puncture or throw them a new tire on . i have 8 vehicles and have always used big o in payson but after this i 'm going to go elsewhere !	2146
1	love love love this place . very clean and everyone is very nice . after the massage i felt like a new person , my feet did not hurt for the first time i can remember . you can not beat the price for the service you get .	991
1	went for lunch on a friday . do n't miss the lunch specials on the board . server alfredo was like a extremely friendly street ninja . back and forth taking care of me as needed . always knowing what i needed before i did , taking care of me and silently moving on to the next guest . ordered a dozen to start . the chefs hands were a blur as he popped them quicker than my eyes could follow and had them sitting in front of me almost immediately . well done gentlemen .	1255
0	rude barber . rough with my son . does n't talk at all . and so-so cut . wo n't be going back !	430
0	staff is extremely rude and could care less about their customers . i needed a hat for a derby party and was extremely excited to come to this place . i got there 15 mins before they closed and we were told by a young girl they were closing in 2 mins . we explained we just needed to get a hat for tomorrow and a older lady chimed in saying they were about to close . i expected more from the people that worked here . what ever happened to customer service . i 'm extremely disappointed and will never come back here ! ! !	3839
0	terrible customer service . they continuously raised their rates and have a high turnover . poor customer service and when you speak to a manager they are full of excuses . it 's clear where the employees get their attitudes from .	2501
0	this place has a very cold feel to it . the employees are not very friendly and the set up of the store seems very narrow . i wo n't be coming back .	1971
1	the customer service at neiman marcus is top notch . every time i visit the store i am greeted by every sales associate , but not in an overbearing kind of way . and lets face it , their merchandise is not cheap . so if i am going to be making purchases i want to make sure i feel good buying my stuff ! also , the store is clean and easy to navigate . bonus : i love how their store has the nm cafe . its fun to be able to sit down after shopping and be able to have a snack ( or full meal ) .	485
0	terrible , terrible , horrible service and we were the only table in the place ! food was good .	151
1	nothing bad to say about these guys . the two at front are great ( wish i could remember their names ) . excellent customer service . i had no problems scheduling an appointment . i came in for an oil leak , which was pretty bad . ran a test to find exactly where it came from instead of searching and guessing . before doing any of the work they told me what they found and gave me a quote for the part and labor to ensure i wanted to move forward . they have a little lounge with a tv and plenty of reading material for your wait . def pleased .	1895
0	tried calling to verify order due to an error message and no one answered the phone ! ! ! ! billed my credit card which i will dispite .	543
1	`` [ tom ] willim is the best provider i have ever had ! god bless him . words ca n't even explain . i love my provider . he is super , he is always taken good care of me and he is so funny ! '' joseph flores	3349
0	i ordered the stromboli for the first time & & it was cooked on the outside w/ all raw dough in the middle . the lady said well its made of dough ummm duh i know that but it does n't mean it 's suppose to be raw & & uncooked inside	459
1	: )	703
1	this place was amazing ! so cute and hipster . it gets a little packed so try avoiding the lunch rush . the food was very flavourful , and it also feels nice to know they 're healthy ( minus the deep fried part ) . the food took a while to come out even when the place was slow but that 's definitely my only complaint ! definitely worth a try	1417
1	i do miss larger whole foods locations , but this one is pretty good . there are some the 365 everyday products here that i just love ( like sangria ) . we like the cheese selection at this store , we would love it if they carried cheese from iceland . their prepared foods are pretty good and they have decent selection given the size of the store . they make a great latte at this location as well .	3874
0	would not recommend this place when we had a parking problem because someone else parked in our space and we were told to park in a reserved space our car got towed ! they would do nothing about it !	1798
1	interesting gas station . reminded me of toy story for some reason . very nice attendant and service . got there at 8:58 pm just before closing . fueled up and left .	2639
0	not impressed with their massage service , i had a deep tissue massage and i barely felt anything . the lady literally rub oil for about an hour without a care of the service she provides to the customer . of the hour , she asked me only once if the pressure was good . when i told her to put more pressure , i honestly could not feel a difference . to be honest , i think i was better off giving myself a massage .	381
1	the part worth going to this event is definitely the ostrich race event . imagine men sitting on plumpy ostriches and then falling off . it is hillarious . these brids are actually dangerous so props for them for sitting on them in the first place . the event was highly entertaining and they get participation from the audience . there is a petting zoo portion that has all sorts of animals from an ox to baby goats . you can even feed the animals for a small price . the rest of the festival was pretty usual . over priced food and lots of crowds . i would recommend going the $ 10 paid was worth the hilarious entertainment .	759
0	uneducated workers are so rude and they are trying to fool americans that conversion is equal for us dollar and canadian dollar if they pay cash where actually the conversion rate is only around .60 cents us dollar only for 1 canadian dollar . attn . police dpt . investigate them especially the workers . very bad experience for the tourist .	2069
0	i really do n't think these bagels taste like ny bagels at all . and the bialys taste like ... whatever bialys taste like . sorry , but these are n't ' the real deal to me . i tried them over several months and just could n't get used to them .	325
0	simplicity laser has no flexibility for appointment setting . i have had to make every appointment 1-2 months in advance . i have a schedule that is only made available to me 6 weeks at a time . the treatments do not take more than a half hour and it seems that if i have to reschedule they are `` booked '' for another 6 weeks thus the time between treatments sometimes ranges 2 months for me . the technician is very nice and professional but simplicity 's philosophy on appointment booking leaves much to be desired . with a saturated market in laser hair removal i would expect to be able to make an appointment with in a 3 week to one month period .	343
0	the doctors were highly recommend by our re and i 'm sure it 's a great practice , however they told us they do n't accept aetna insurance ! such a big carrier with a huge number of subscribers is not accepted ? i 'm sure they 've got their reasons but i 'm really disappointed !	2442
0	buyer beware and check expiration dates on the medication they send you . i had them send me 8 boxes of meds . they taped them together so all i noticed was the expiration dates on the outside boxes ( which were a year out ) ... the inside boxes all expired within 2 months . totally sketchy and unethical for a pharmacy to be doing .	3283
0	i forgot why i did n't go to jiffy lube . my oil and filter that should 've run me about 30 bucks at the dealer was 150+ here . they did n't tell me until after it was all done . the waiting room at this one is lackluster for a place to wait . i always feel like you have to watch them like a hawk and this is one place you really need to because if you do n't , be prepared to take it .	2852
1	came here to get an oil changed and was pleasantly surprised . was able to get my car 's oil changed and a complimentary car wash and detailing . will return here . it has a nice outdoor covered waiting area complete with a small waterfall to add to the ambience .	1502
1	great ownership . reasonable prices . knowledgeable staff . this is a great place to better you !	641
0	this was a great place to go for a hand car wash. that was 6 months ago at best . the quality of their help and knowledge has gone down drastically . no one there knows what to do . they are understaffed . customer base is shrinking . wish they were better , a good hand car was is hard to find . hope the owner reads this and does something about it . two stars now at best	2359
1	local family business that was helpful , very friendly , and exceptional customer service ! they do great custom work and would n't go anywhere else in the las vegas area !	419
0	this restaurant is terrible . my boyfriend and i love sushi ; we 're both from la so we 've had extensive experience with it . we had the boston roll and the spicy sushi on top looked like mushed hamburger meat . i am not exaggerating in the least . it was by far the worst sushi roll i have ever tried . we also had the crunchy eel roll , which seemed like it was a reheated roll since it was tough to chew . i honestly can not believe it has four stars . i know it 's arizona , but there are actually decent sushi restaurants out here . this is not one of them .	198
0	if you 're the type of person that wants to go out on a saturday night to be seen , then this is the place for you . but it sure as hell is n't the place for me . the club is packed full of puffy chested db 's and women that are just looking to have their drinks paid for . the staff were great . though i 'm probably biased as my friend has connections and got us in for free with no line , no cover , and a few other benefits .	2873
0	i ordered a simple blt with avocado . the sandwich was mostly just bread and the mayo was extremely heavy . the bacon was minimal and weird and there was barely any lettuce or avocado . it took over 30 minutes to get it delivered . the guy who took my order took my address incorrectly , so the delivery driver ended up in the wrong place . $ 13.00 for a sandwich , some chips and an iced tea ? i 'd at least expect ingredients on my sandwich .	1475
1	best shop in the world go see eddie ! he 's the best ! ! there prices are very good for the quality of work that you get . i always get asked where i get my haircut from	761
0	still no toilet , no return phone calls , no return texts . he is pathetic . dennis sullivan , the owner , is extremely combative and basically needs to go back to etiquette school and stop treating a women like a piece if shit . he wo n't deliver a toilet because he does n't have any balls ( he is obviously afraid of me ) he refuses to even have any contact with me .	3719
0	i went for lunch today . place was n't very busy . sat at the bar . waited for 10 minutes for a server . finally somebody came and refilled the water glass of a guy a few seats away . then he got into a long conversation with the hostess . after another 5 minutes i left . i do n't think they cared . not going back . from the lack of people at noon , i think others have come to the same conclusion .	209
1	love this nice , older , asian fellow named tony . i have taken soooo many things to him from cheap lugguage to be repaired to my beloved gucci and a vintage chanel bag . he does a great job every time , has never been late getting stuff back to me . and best of all does n't charge me an arm and a leg ! highly recommended - tiny shop . hidden - but great location . near shea and tatum - near ups store , cleaners and subway - behind gas station - in alberstons shipping center .	1266
1	stayed here twice and both times have been great . room was clean , no issues , staff is nice . excellent , hearty free breakfast , clean pool . honestly , we stay here because of the beds ( as is the criteria i base most my hotel reservations on : if we like the beds we stay there . ) the cloud 9 bed is ahhhhh-mazing and never disappoints . ( they actually have the info in the room as to where you can buy one and the bedding set . good location , north phoenix , by squaw peak , close to freeway but no freeway noise . our go to place in north phx . = )	1195
0	not a good nail place went in to get a full set and asked for polish ... she gave me some to pick from and then she started painting as i did n't know she was doing gel i have never had it so i did n't know the difference she finished and when i thought i was going to pay 25-30 they ended up being $ 48 i was not happy when i got home i realized that a lot of my own nail was still showing looks like i already need a fill	1685
1	i just recently went to the vh spa for spa week . once again , i was pleased beyond belief . the spa area itself is smaller than i would like to truly spend an entire day there . however , the amenities , service and treatments surpass any space concerns . i had a massage this time and it was great . many times at other spas you walk away feeling relaxed but your pain or issue really is n't resolved . the therapists at the ho all seem to have a `` knack '' at figuring out what is wrong . i would recommend the vh spa to anyone who wants to leave with results ! ! ! !	3287
1	update : this is the only useful yelp i 've ever written ! how could only one person find this useful ? i do n't understand ...	1641
1	food was really good service took a while understandable because they were busy and only one waitress and a helper.. do n't recall what day we went but it was buy one cocktail get 1 free .	571
0	george 's gyro is cheaper ! 7oz gyro 7.99 comes with side salad or fries olives 4oz 6.95 just the sandwich .	875
1	man ! ! ! what a store ! ! i basically live in vegas and i can not believe i 've never been here . this place is not an ordinary store where you can find your gear to go out camping , fishing , or whatever you 're into because i felt like i was at a museum at times ! ! i can not wait to bring my parents next time we visit las vegas . the bf and i were not able to finish looking around the first floor let alone go upstairs to the second one because we were in a rush . so next time this will be the first place we visit on our next vegas trip !	2601
1	just had my 4 dogs groomed by moe - she was awesome and she did a great job . i 'm very happy with how all my dogs turned out , especially my little pom who got a little matted since the last groom .	1218
0	would give a 0 if i could . terrible services . very unprofessional establishment . was very unsatisfied with my lash extensions . cherry claimed that they were individuals and they were clusters . had made an appointment and did n't get seen until 3 hours later . and my eyelashes fell off the next day . horrible experience .	1840
0	seriously weird place.i do n't believe it 's run to its fullest potential . maybe i 'm too old for this scene ? maybe i just do n't get it . i believe that if you offer table service , it should be more than clearing the tables . servers come by to collect empties , yet do n't ask if we want another round . i do admit it 's a nice central place to meet up with friends before going to a bar that values customers . remember to go to the bar to order .	3343
1	wonderful service dr. andersen and her staff were knowledgable and very friendly . the facility is very clean and well organized they have an open door policy and have puppy visits which help socialize your new pup . great boarding options and i love how they have puppy cameras available to ease your mind .	3076
1	excellent place to go . the staff are very professional and know what they are doing . kris is excellent at massage . she is very knowledgeable and very kind . i would recommend her to anyone !	1656
1	excellent service , quality , and pace of the meal . i always forget about the little extras you receive with french dining . the lobster bisque palate cleanser before the main course changed my life . too bad we could n't stay for dessert . next time .	429
1	they have a great selection of car seats , in stock . that was great , instead of having a limited selection and having to order online and pick up instore or whatever . i checked beforehand before i went there , to buy our car seat , so i was not in store for very long . however they seem to have a large selection of baby items .	3789
1	i 've taken my two boys to several different doctors/pas with mesa pediatrics . pretty much without exception , everyone has been empathetic , knowledgeable , and has gotten our problems solved quickly . my only complaint is because of some difficulty contacting the office . they have weird , short hours for answering their phones , and it usually goes to voice mail even during those hours . and although they have a patient portal , it looks like they 've turned off the functionality that lets you send secure messages through it . i would much rather communicate through email or the website than have my work day interrupted by return calls .	3893
1	the reuben ! ! ! if you go here you have to try the reuben . i had a hankering and they fulfilled it ! really modern setting and they have noble mission .	277
1	took our slightly husky cat `` butters '' to his first real vet visit and it could n't have gone any better ! ! great facility ! but most importantly , great staff ! ! from the walk in , being greeted by meredith to meeting raquel , the veterinarian nurse , who was amazing with our butterball . very welcoming and comforting to us `` humans '' but most importantly , our little big guy . very knowledgable about cats , as i can guarantee they are with dogs . so much great advice and care directions . they will soon enough have two more patients .	3076
1	nicolette was awesome and personable . she really made me feel comfortable getting my nose pierced . i feel like i made the right choice coming here . great experience . very clean place and they use a needle to pierce . a1 service .	2790
0	have used this company for several months with very little problem , however , after yesterday 's visit , they will not be back . arrived 35 minutes late and only stayed for 40 minutes , hardly enough time to properly clean my house . they totally skipped over two bedrooms . one maid was new so can not totally review her , but the other maid had been over previously but she has a very `` i 'd rather not be here '' attitude . never again !	2994
1	staff is beverly professional . their work is very thorough and they walk you through each step . have been taking my truck here for over ten years and not one issue with the work they have done . traditionally jiffy lubes get a bad wrap , but this is certainly the exception . they are very good .	2086
1	un petit café/brunch vraiment sympathique , très cosy et idéalement situé proche du biodome d'où nous sortions . le grilled cheese chèvres/tomates séchées est vraiment top ! le brunch du weekend semblait également très appétissant . nous n'avons pas gouté les patisseries , mais elles faisaient envie ( je n'avais juste plus du tout faim ) .	184
1	i have been taking my son to see dr tripp for two years . he 's really helped with his adhd and it was nice to be able to get some testing done on the office , the qb test gives a really clear picture of the adhd symptoms . my other son saw catherine surovy for a few months , she was an excellent therapist .	1541
0	bartender is an ass , nothing special as far as the bar goes . it 's the closest one to my house and i wo n't be returning . there 's still plenty of bars still less than 5 minutes away .	1295
0	good god avoid this shoppers if you can ! the cashier forgot to put two products in my bag during checkout , when i went back and told them ( showing my receipt ) they gave me the hardest time for a mistake they made ! treated me like a goddamn thief . not only that but front-end store manager kris was a total douche ( really rude and condescending ) . do not go here .	2534
0	a key to having a successful business is staying current with the competition and adapting . my recommendation to studio 360 is check out your competition and adapt . the studio has potential to be great but it 's classes are sub par compared to the competition .	3477
1	love this place . the food is really great . i 've been to both locations . it 's a small place so be careful when going during peak times . service has always been excellent .	1332
0	absolutely no flavor `` all rice and beans , and very little meat '' . there spicy salsa had no flavor and was unbearably spicy and i like spicy . now a couple of hours later my stomach is turning and i 'm going to have too miss class tonight . mexican food that is not even close to mexican food . thanks wandering donkey !	388
1	i 'll make this short ... sort of like my visit to urgent care . i was in and out in an hour . they were professional , kind , understanding and did exactly what i needed . i had jammed my ring finger with my wedding rings on them and needed them cut off . they did the job and all was well . this was my second visit and i am totally happy with them . i 'm glad they 're near me .	3698
0	if there was a zero star i would have given them this . i have had usaa for over the past 5 years and i recently changed my auto and home insurance after learning how much i was overpaying for both of these . i called to cancel both of these and since then i feel like i have been jerked around in their customer service department and they are finally sending my check after calling them 5 times !	3429
0	not too thrilled . we walked by on our way to eat at one of the restaurants and saw how busy it was . then walking back , decided to give it a go . it took 20 minutes from time of order to time it was in our hands to get it . i ordered the s'mores one . it was basically chocolate or cream with two large marshmallows on top , with a graham cracker , & chocolate drizzle . for $ 6.50 , not worth it , especially for the wait . the concept is neat . but nothing special .	2911
1	they changed the cd finally ! it 's still pretty bad and repetitive though . also the food is still great .	1231
1	this a great find ! went here for mother 's day and my crepe was free bc i was a mom ; talk about customer service . the waitstaff came around frequently to check on us , and the food was really good too . we will definitely be back !	1011
1	i seem to have have adopted slem as fuel/sundries stop of choice . my one beef is the parking lot , it can get tight during the busy times but as luck would have it i have not been tagged ( myself or my vehicle ) yet . all in all , prices are comparable to everywhere else but it is the employees that keep me coming back . those working behind the counter work quick to get you in and out but without any attitude . i really appreciate the customer service .	2564
0	stopped in yesterday and asked if they could take us dollar , she said yes . but would not recognize the exchange rate . as a franchise , i assume that each location would make it 's own decision in recognizing foreign currency exchange rates . but all across canada ? so for every current us $ 1 i lose .20 cents .	2048
0	i bought 4 viennese sausages ( saucisses de vienne ) & 1 lb of headcheese ( fromage de tête ) . the sausages is so so but the headcheese is a total disaster . the headcheese usually is blended in the gelatin but this time it was totally in grease , white grease so i ca n't even take the meat out , so i threw all the headcheese in the garbage . 9 $ lost . next time , i will stick to my german butcher on cote-des-neiges at queen mary .	1313
0	worst holiday experience ever ! ! ! ! ! ! waited 40 minutes for bundtletts that i ordered ahead of time for 9am but i did n't get to picking them up till 4pm ! while i was waiting all that time outside they were constantly taking the walk ins before the preorders . once i finally got inside i got to deal with the rude employees . they even told a customer to hurry up because they were waisting their time . they were yelling at customers and were the rudest employees i had ever dealt with . they told numerous pre orders that their orders were not done . we are regulars there and that is no way to treat your customers !	18
1	got ta get - indian fry bread , turkey legs and bbq sandwich	2076
0	terrible food -- - this past weekend i ordered the gnocchi & lobster ravioli . the gnocchi itself was $ 20 ! that does n't include seafood or any meat . i could n't even take two bites out of the entree . it 's hard to go wrong with gnocchi ( it 's my fave ) . but mannnnn ... . so disappointed . the lobster ravioli was ok , but i 'll warn you ... it 's super duper salty .	368
0	i have tried this place a couple of times because every place can have a bad day-but each time is a pattern . went with another person and compared notes each time so it is just not me . the food was not `` hot '' . it was warm - even the soup . yes , we did have to have the plates returned to the kitchen to be reheated . the food was good - just not hot . i want a hot meatloaf sandwich to be hot . think they should look into it . i have talked to other people and they concur . i tried to get opinions in case it was just me or my dining partner .	1499
1	so happy i found this place ... did n't realize what a dump la fitness was until i went in and checked this place out . and extra $ 100 bucks a month is worth being able to use an obsessively clean locker room/sauna/steam , have a locker , have room to work out ... i have found i spend 3x as much time at the gym being at village vs what i spent at lafitness ... it makes working out go from being a chore , to being something desirable ... atleast for me . the only thing i can complain about is the price , and it 's hard to complain about it because i like the place so much ...	2499
0	starbucks like all fast food outlets have the same quality food and drinks wherever location you go so i 'm not commenting on what i eat or drink here . if you go to any starbucks you know what you 're getting . but what totally sucks and borders on the unethical is they do n't tag prices on the food products on display . so you do n't know how much it costs until you 've waited in line and asked at the cash register . i asked the cashier why this is so but she had no answer . is this some kind of trick ? are they saying if you have to ask you ca n't afford it ?	3558
0	get a thrill out of finding foreign objects in your food ? then bol d'or is the place for you ! a few months ago my general taos was `` peppered '' with small , sharp white fragments of plastic . today , i found a strip of metal in my soupe aigre-piquant . i wonder how many foreign objects i have n't found ( i.e . i unwittingly ingested ) while eating here . i wo n't be eating here again ; it 's simply too dangerous .	1336
0	i do n't know why everyone loves this place . i think the food is average at best . your typical fast food joint . flies on the window , crumbs on the table from the last guest and the sick teenager running the cash register . i had unpleasant gastrointestinal feelings after i got home . i do n't see a reason to go back .	572
1	we just had robert , from the appliance doctor , to check my dacor oven . i have never had a repair service clinician so prompt , so polite and courteous ! and , gave me helpful tips on how to use my ovens ... he went above and beyond ! will definitely reccomend to family and friends !	2660
1	there was a girl working by the name of cristina . she was super friendly courteous and helpful and i 've never encountered anyone at any target as nice as she was she alone will be the reason that of all the targets i can go to i 'll go to that one in hopes that they actually have people learn from her	3259
0	the customer service in this place is horrible . we have used them over 2 years and it disturbing how often we have experienced unpleasantness over the phone or in person by staff here . the doctors are okay if you have the time to get to know them but it 's hard with their front help not accommodation or helpful when called upon .	3570
1	i have just started going here ( first baby ) & i have had a really wonderful experience so far ! the reception staff have been very pleasant & efficient . my doctor is friendly , personable , helpful - actually read & went over my medical records with me ! ! ( that 's never happened anywhere else before lol ! ! ) i have high hopes , no complaints thus far ... . ! !	2096
0	this review is in regards to discount saturdays : you really get what you pay for , a shitty piercing . i got my tongue pierced there not too long ago and they messed up bad , she free hands this piercing and it comes out slanted , then had to get it re-pierced the next day . i do n't suggest anyone go here for the discount regardless of how good the price is , its not worth the possibility of a ruined piercing .	2764
1	very pleased . honest ! i came in with two broken samsung tablets . jesus gave me a quote for the broken gass tablet -i said ill wait because i did n't use it as much and told me they would diagnose my other tablet for free and get back within 24 to 48 hrs . jesus was very , polite and knowledgeable . bottom line i got a call within 2 hours that my tablet was fixed and because it was a simple fix-no charge . how nice is that !	339
0	went to the restaurant for breakfast today , and did n't immediately like it . we were n't seated promptly , and our party of 5 was seated at a 4-seater ... we squeezed . our food took a long while to come out , but i enjoyed the food that i ordered so i guess that made up for it . however , the bill took forever to come too after asking a few times . on top of it all we saw the bus boy more than our waitress . friendly staff , and a fairly clean restaurant , but speed was not their top priority , so that ruined our experience .	1939
1	i love this place . my son spent a summer in thailand and swears this is authentic . i just love the food and the people . the best service and amazing food . have been eating here for at least 5 years . best curry around . you ca n't go wrong with either red , yellow or my favorite , masaman curry .	1450
1	had the lamb special with a demi glaze that was incredible ! the steaks here are also fantastic , sides are plentiful and the wine , of course good ! never had a bad experience with the service either , everyone is friendly and helpful ,	1147
1	i rarely give 5 star reviews , however these folks deserve it . good prices and great service . yesterday i drove in with a nail in my tire , they fixed it in short order . i will continue to use them for both my cars .	1957
0	usually love to go thing shopping , but the staff at pink was horribly inconsiderate and rude . i felt very unwanted and will not be returning soon . my expierence at this specific pink was poor and i will not return but i will not cast out the chain as a whole . staff needs to improve kindness and care .	2511
1	very good but not as good a falbo 's or ians . if you live in the area it is the best for miles around . service is good and the bathrooms are clean .	218
1	i want to say jamie was a great help today ! my husband and i went in to get a tour and she was so informed and her cool attitude explaining of different layouts . definitely ca n't wait to move in the two months	2992
0	they were prompt but very expensive . less than $ 100 in parts and $ 380 in labor for 45 minutes . ugh !	2776
0	was here an afternoon this week and did not have a please time . not only were fries sitting for over 10 minutes on the ledge , the server was unbearable to speak to due to their attitude . also , the bathroom sink needs to be cleaned more often as there were bugs in the sink - not sure if it was an infestation issue or what . beware everyone reading this . i will unfortunately not return .	1583
1	great , helpful staff . everyone is super nice , welcoming campus . always a positive experience .	2787
0	service is n't that great . the 3 times i 've gone the waiter swipes my card for everyone else when my and friends got separate checks . there 's too many young girls . they need more training . very clueless waiters . sorry . but i rather drive all the way to tempe bww then go to scottsdales even thou i live a few blocks away . foods good . just to eat there.no ! ! ! !	383
0	do n't try to book an appointment here with the owner by text , it 's a joke . she wo n't respond half the time and will continue to put you off . when you finally get fed up and mention the poor customer service , owner will suddenly be very responsive , get really defensive , and blame the cell phone company and not take responsibility for being non responsive . i finally gave up because she clearly did n't want my business .	3233
0	ordered a pizza for delivery through the online service was quoted an hour for delivery which was what i expected . but after about 45 min i got updates saying it was going to take longer . after an hour and 40 min i called and cancelled my order because i did n't have time to wait any longer . i was pretty disappointed i waited around and then did n't have time to eat before work .	459
0	only went a couple of months . moved away to two different states and still were billing a nonexistent card and went collections . how is it right to pay for a gym membership when you dont live in the state that the gym is located in . contract for what thin air ? you can be a honest company and quit trying to take money from someone that cant use your equipment . well now you got your money and i hope this helps any new member to go over the fine print . we live in a world of crooks .	3268
1	i iove my chicken bowl ! i have never been disappointed with the flavor of my food . i hate the ever present line ... i guess everybody loves their food as well ...	869
1	i love this pet store . beautiful pets & great customer service and also affordable prices on their pet food , toys ect .	386
0	avoid at all costs . they will take your money , tell you they 're doing you a `` favor '' , and then leave you with an unfinished product . they also threw out a $ 1000 slab that we paid for because they said they would fix it and never gave us the product back . so , they 're thieves , too . made us pay more for new product . when i called to get the last piece completed jeffrey picked a fight with me , cursed at me , and hung up the phone refusing to finish the job .	2090
1	this place is amazing ! the whole family ordered something different so it was good to have a bite of everything ! we had a snicker doodle cookie , it was a million times better than i have ever made ! a dirt cup that was so sweet i was grateful for the size . birthday cake , mocha and snickers macaroons , i 'm not sure what my favorite was . they were all so unique and delicious ! a rice crispy treat with a thick layer of carmel on top drizzled and dipped in chocolate..amazing ! i was really impressed with this place and will definitely recommend and return !	981
0	the staff and owner are friendly but overall their blowouts are subpar . the girl who worked on me seemed really green and the overall result showed . also , it took her over an hour to blow dry my hair , usually takes 30 minutes when i get it blown out . i left leaving disappointed as my hair was frizzy and i knew my hair would n't keep the curl and it did n't but i did n't have time to say anything , i was already in a pinch for time . my hair was flat within four hours . no matter what i will always stick with platinum entourage or save the $ 40 and do my hair myself .	1423
0	seems like more and more shops are closing . i do n't go often , but every time i 'm close by it surprise me to see half empty mall . all the good stores in the area are actually outside that mall , and from what it looks now soon enough it will be only macy 's and jcp there	2815
0	had to wait to be seated , hostess/cashier doing both positions , waitress finally comes over to advise us she will be with us in a few minutes . place order to find out we would be substituting items because they ran out . items were not brought out all at once leaving part of the meal cold . we will not be returning for a meal . have n't had a problem with picking up pies . disappointment , i have been eating here since they opened , looks like ihop is our new spot when it opens .	672
0	total rip off . 139 dollars for a piece of pipe that 's available online for 69 . these guys should go out of business they are terrible . they are not nice either . the sigh and get upset all the time . i do n't like them .	2202
1	i went in yesterday , spent $ 80- got 3 bottoms , 3 tops , and 2 pairs of ( pretty much new ) nike 's . and to think if i 'd gone to the mall , i would have spent the same amount of money and just one pair of nike 's , if not more ... love this place ! and i have been to both locations and the staff is so sweet at both ! as a thrifter , uptown cheapskate is in my top 3 favorites places to shop .	1446
0	after watching the video of the little girl being falsely accused behind stealing i will no longer shop at any target . it 's sad how a young woman at this store can be stabbed . now your managers and loss prevention ppl ca n't simply handle a child with class . and yes it 's racial . but i will never spend a fucking dime in any of your stores . that woman who handled that child like that should be fired . i 'll take my business else where i ca n't shop at any place who ca n't train it 's employees to handle anyone in a professional manner and keep its patrons safe .	1626
0	visited this place for the first time . yes they have alot to choose from but not readily available for customers to look at . there were 2 employees to `` help '' . one was stocking the other was helping a customer . i had to ask her to call someone since she was clearly busy with someone . very disorganized , open boxes all over . it was the least bit welcoming . i 'll never go there again . i gave it 2 stars because they have a big selection	1659
1	great lunch place for a burger , fries and a coke . fast service , friendly staff , 50s diner atmosphere , clean . recommend the cowboy burger if you 're in the mood to indulge . my 'go to ' burger place in this locale .	1461
0	this is by far one of the worst restaurant services that i have had . there 's a disorganization in th whole kitchen , my party and i have been waiting over 3 hours now for our food , and the worst of all is the appetizers have t even come in either . they have been giving us one plate of food per hour . people have been coming in and out with their plates and we just keep being forgotten . i hope this restaurant reorganizes their standards in the quality of service that they provide .	190
0	i ordered a birthday cake with vanilla butter cream icing and white cake . when i picked it up it was decorated nicely , however after trying the cake the icing had no vanilla flavor at all it tasted like crisco and sugar and the cake was dry . i will not be going back here .	868
1	went back again last night . got the family combo , but they allowed us to substitute the ribs for the three bbq sides ( brisket , pulled pork , and turkey ) . got some wings too . food was good not great . server was good . kept the drinks full . refilled my drink and did n't even see her do it . sneaky fast . kids loved the bull ride . do n't know how they will stay in business though as we were there from 6-8pm and place was empty . kids like the place so i 'm sure we 'll be back .	341
0	i ordered a java chip frappucino and it was totally watered down and not icy . a total rip off .	906
1	the new boston pizza on young and empress near north york center . the inside looks cool , with lots of tvs to watch while waiting for the order to come . the orders was slow to come , however it was really fresh and a delight for your taste buds . the pepperoni bacon pizza burger was really tasty .	363
1	this place has been pretty good for me and now my husband . sometimes there is a bit of a wait , which is really the only thing i do n't like . and , usually if i have to get blood work , they usually can get it in one try . they used to be at a different location in this same set of office suites , but they moved within the past year . the newer place is nicer , but i 'm not sure if they are the same people or not . but , no real issues , just the wait time .	3325
1	love that every sermon is full of sound biblical doctrine . also this church is out in the highways and hedges doing the first works . if you truly follow christ the world will hate you , which is evident in all these other reviews . if you 're looking for a watered down family fun center with a self help motivational message , this is not the place for you . if you want to grow in faith , learn clear biblical doctrine , and become a disciple of christ , then this is your church .	3393
1	boris was great and fixed my refrigerator defroster problem . he was very professional . the parts came in very fast within 4 days . i am very pleased with the company .	3885
1	better than sorrentos and care about the pitt community which is why i want to keep them in business , serving pitt students the best pizza in oakland	662
1	brandi is amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! i went from blond to a dark chocolate red ! huge change . i was very anxious when i got there but after talking to brandi and looking through all the colors my anxiety turned into excitement . it was a great experience . i love love love my hair ! ! ! ! now that i live in vegas she is who i will be going to every time !	2908
0	you could not pay me to set foot in this place again . grunge setting for trivia folks and mostly bar flies on that scene . if i could give it a zero , i would . see james c 's review . says it all .	698
0	good products , decent prices , not good service ! i used to shop at 4 wheel parts in mesa for over 10 years running . the staff almost always acted too busy and grumpy to provide good service like you were bothering them spending $ 2,000+ at a time ... . the attitude here progressively got worse since 2005 to present ... now i do n't go here anymore as i found other places nearby where you are welcomed and people are friendly ... they have a great selection of parts that is difficult to ignore and other locations are better , but this store wo n't get my business ever again ... .	2632
0	takes them forever to get anything done . everyone treats you like you 're stupid and do n't understand anything . and give outrageously expensive rates for a mediocre job	3020
1	really , really , really good milk tea boba ! the best i have found in the chandler/gilbert area . and the prices are good ! it 's the bomb !	490
1	first time trying this place and i will definitely be back . anthony was so helpful ! cyo burrito was amazing and the chicken teriyaki bowl was juicy and delicious ! i 'll become a regular really soon !	1354
0	dr wang is really nice and listens . it 's a shame that the front office receptionists are so awful . absolutely zero customer service skills . any questions you have you are treated like you are bothering them . it 's so bad that i am switching doctors .	2298
1	i 've been seeing dr. herrera and jenna ( pa ) for several years , since ccm first opened . dr : herrera and jenna are awesome , but they book out far in advance often . recently , i saw kyle ( pa ) and he was awesome as well . i highly recommend dr. herrera , dr. smith , jenna and kyle . i 've seen their other providers , but none made me feel comfortable like the providers i mentioned .	590
1	jill is one of our vendors from rainforest plumbing & air and they are the best ! we recently had a huge resident activity that rainforest plumbing & air participated in by making a generous donation . we appreciate their business and recommend anyone to use rainforest plumbing & air . thank you jill , we appreciate everything that you do for us at ascent at papago park !	2775
1	great staff , very knowledgeable and efficient and my new felt single speed in gorgeous green stops traffic ! if you want solid customer service and a unique , quality selection of bikes head over here ! i have n't tried any of the cafe stuff but i hear its all pretty tasty .	3726
0	the cool thing about this strip club is locals plus a guest do n't have to pay a cover to get in . beyond that i am not the right person to review strip clubs as its not my thing . i never go to walmart and pay them to look at groceries so i really do n't understand how people find this a fun activity at a strip club . clean decent girls if you like strip clubs this one seems ok .	1779
1	after several fails with other stylist i have finally found the one ! ! chyna is absolutely amazing ! ! she is fantastic at cuts ... and will give you what you ask for . i trust her eye and judgement and always walk out with a nice cut . i highly recommend her to everyone ! : )	1617
0	buffet standards , it 's eh . the place is very large , simple and it has a decent amount of choices . watch out for some super salty items , they are just inedible . as for sushi , it has a bit more to choose from than others but it 's quality is average . service is rushed at times such as finishing one plate of food and then seeing my check already . still , it 's value works with the cheap price .	1302
0	what a decline in everything . they stopped producing anything fresh , the shrimp tempura had obviously been microwaved and the sushi was god awful . i used to go all the time , i 'd never return again . they also go rid of the checklist for ayce and the server has to try and remember everything you want . super crappy , she could n't remember half of the stuff we wanted but i do n't blame her .	745
1	the whole experience went very smoothly . nice showroom with great selection and prices . just got my sofa , recliners , and coffee table . delivery was so easy , they emailed me a time frame of 1030 to 130 then called with 1130 to 130 and came at 12 . they were very sweet and helpful . highly recommend	439
1	one of the few places in scottsdale area where you can get , legitimate , authentic modern furniture from names like knoll , herman miller , saarinen and eames . this is not discount shopping , this is quality statement type furniture that will stand the test of time . i can not get enough of this showroom .	613
0	if i could give this office a zero , i would . i have been seeing dr. sharif for six months . he is always behind , usually , at least an hour . then he spends about two minutes with me . the office staff is always very rude and put off . i do not recommend this physician and i am in the medical field . this is a common issue with dr. sharif , just read the reviews .	2176
0	avoid at all cost . worst service ever . and the food , not good . sticky rice not cooked at all . soup , all broth with a few chunks of nasty meat ( i think it was meat ) .	1366
1	how can you get better than a 24-hour auto parts store ? it is just so darn convenient , perhaps too much so . i have found myself here after 10pm two times in the past week with my car obsessed husband . both times it has been slammed , but we 've received courteous service and some spark plugs . on our last visit , they did n't have what we needed , but they were quick to suggest where we could find what we were looking for . and , i am pretty sure they will match competitors ' prices . whether you are car-obsessed or just in desperate need of a part at 2am , they will get it done !	424
0	yeah they 're hot they can dance but afterwards for the pictures the guys were total dicks .	2149
0	service was absolutely terrible ! the food was mediocre at best ! 1/10 will not be back . i will stick to the huntersville location	1147
1	great place to meet for work stuff . we invited clients and the everyone took great care of us . they gave us a special area that worked great .	951
1	update : we went again for 2017 and had a great time . no hassle this year about the camera ... no one said a word and it was so nice . we had a wonderful time on the rides and i really appreciate how many rides they have for the younger kids and how well it is separated from the teen/adult rides .	759
1	very clean , very friendly people . okay breakfast , small indoor pool . i would stay here again .	681
1	this is a very good cupcake , so much so that at the time i originally wrote the review i deleted the other cupcake places i reviewed so far ! today i had `` mississippi mud '' for the second time !	2013
1	tj maxx is a great store with plenty of variety . i particularly like this location because you can hit up the two sister stores , homegoods and marshall 's with ease .	2343
0	najib was the best around . i got a cut from the new owner shortly after he took over , and it was pretty terrible .	14
0	there is a reason there is no one here ! i have been to this location one other time and it was much better . i will never go back again . hamburgers were like sawdust . staff was rude . not worth the price . i ca n't wait for burger priest to open on kipling and queensway . i am sure gourmet burger will end up closing	80
1	they have a variety of giant french macaroons ! all look so yummy to look at . i ordered some for my nieces and they loved it ! we also had some of the pastries . hmm i 'm not really a fan of it . i feel like it was missing something , just not sure what . their prices are the same as going to the pastry stores in the casino at the strip .	981
1	love love love their breakfast burritos and the fact that they 're open 24 hours . the lady who always seems to be on shift whenever i stop in is friendly , quick , and efficient .	322
1	we 've stayed at this hilton garden inn least 6 times in the last couple of years . we always get a suite , it 's worth the extra dollars to have the space . rooms are clean and have a wet bar with a fridge and microwave and keurig coffeemaker . beds are comfy . breakfast is not free , but there are plenty of choices if you do n't want to have breakfast there including a starbucks across the street . staff has always been accommodating .	1633
0	i waited for the doctor for an hour and 45 minutes . they always seem to run behind . parking is horrendous too . i never want to go back . i get there early like they ask and they ca n't even take me on time .	1149
1	extremely large rooms , very clean and comfortable beds . very quiet and secure , decently located for a one night stay over . the shower and bathroom were in good shape . i 'd definitely stay here again if needed .	1888
0	i purchased a groupon for a shellac manicure . my experience was terrible although the woman doing my nails was very friendly . first , she did not do anything except buff the tops of my nails , and minor cuticle cutting . she did n't even file my nails . second , she only covered the middle of my nails , leaving the sides and tips unpainted . two days later , one nail had chipped halfway off and today , 4 days later , every single nail is chipped . shellac is supposed to last two weeks at least , so i am very disappointed with the results .	841
0	brought my schnoodle in recently for grooming . after explaining how we preferred her hair to be cut and specifically asking them not to cut her face or beard , the groomer totally disregarded our request and trimmed her beard and entire face . when we picked her up we felt rushed out the door . we also found a few cuts on her body . we will not return and i will also be taking my business elsewhere for food and treats .	3433
1	i loved this place and i 'm not sure why . maybe because in my state you can only buy beer in a grocery store or a beer distributor and wine in a liquor store and this place sells both . i was surprised that the prices are low since in my hometown corner stores are way over priced . a nice selection of candy and snacks and even a decent selection of wine .	1968
0	softshell crab was burned . raw salmon was very fishy/did not taste fresh . eel still had bones in jt . waitress forgot our appetizers and then forgot to pick up the check . i will not be returning .	198
0	their customer service was so bad it took infiniti corporate a week to investigate the issue , and cost them $ 100 in service credit that we sure as hell wo n't be using at this stealership .	2133
1	i do n't understand some of the bad review here . the place is cheap but is definitely clean . what more are you asking for ?	2695
1	we loved this place , xiao mian is a very popular chinese cuisine from chungking and i 've always wanted to try it . i ordered # 37 , the beef was very tender , the broth was tasty and peanuts added good flavor to the soup . noodles were also very tasty , they dont have any dough flavor . we also ordered their home made icy jelly which is a popular local cuisine in summer time , it 's very refreshing and authentic . waiters and waitresses were super friendly . we will definitely come back	1329
1	we just got our new couch home and set up love it and love the $ 1,400 savings as well ! ! this is an auction and you need to go early to test and see the items . they tell u if something does not work and guarantee stuff that does . we will for sure be back	2329
0	huh ? $ 25 for a lollipop ? i don ' get it . what 's the allure ? not like brittany spears or kim kardashian are paying that ! plus : this company is canadian ! ! ! !	2021
0	wow , i 've been here before but could n't remember the why i did not like coming here . came here today for lunch and now i remember ... stingy rude owners ! wow can i get a word in when i order , the female would not let me talk and then had the nerve to talk on the phone when i tried to order . if you want to order for me i think you should pay as well ... part of customer service is actually listening to the customer . i wo n't be back , food is ok .	205
1	delicious organic , seasonal , and free range fare ! good portion sizes , great service , and reasonably priced ! the veggie rice bowl with tofu and baklava are incredible !	1402
0	my pho of choice is chicken , and the chicken pho at this place had an unusual flavor - kind of sweet . but otherwise , not much other flavor . i had to keep adding soy sauce & sriracha but overall a disappointing meal . i wo n't be back .	1260
1	the breakfast was delicious . ( bacon , egg , and cheese croissant ) the only thing keeping them from more stars was that they were out of ham , cheese , and jalapeño croissant . i have yet to try a donut or coffee here .	3137
1	amazing food and excellent service . i am always happy when i go there and i feel welcomed . very clean place and they have weekend entertainment every friday and saturday with different famous singers on saturdays and a live band .	1235
1	awesome place ! affordable and good quality ! drive thru is super handy when weather is bad ! !	2593
0	mama mia too wants to be a good restaurant . it is a charming place inside , and the staff seems very earnest . it wants to be a place where regulars go , sometimes with friends , to enjoy fine dining . the food does not meet those expectations . my own sense is that the volume of business is not enough to produce excellence from their extensive and ambitious menu .	1224
0	food was okay . but the server was horrible . leticia ( sp ? ) had brown thin hair . she was rude , rolled her eyes and disregarded anything that we had to . favorite part of the visit was the cannoli . but , i will never go back due to her service . she seemed to have personal friends at another table and spent all her time chatting with them .	192
0	when we first walked into the scapegoat it smelled awful . they must of had some sewer problem we only stayed for one drink as the smell was too much . too bad as we had to move our party somewhere else . my husband ordered the ipa ( no double ipa 's ) and i ordered the chardonnay which they only had one option which i thought was kind of strange for it being a place for beer and wine . unfortunately for us it was n't a great experience especially after reading all the positive reviews .	710
0	very easy to schedule an appointment . i did extra strength for 50 minutes and did not see a noticeable difference in my teeth , took pictures in different lighting to make the effect of it . ( i do n't smoke or drink coffee or red wine so my teeth are n't very yellow , but also heard an older women complaining that her teeth did n't noticeably change either ) i also got strep throat right after , it may be a coincidence but wanted to post incase anyone else was getting sick too .	3190
1	my brother shotgunned it during a leave from iraq , and gave the entire family one weeks notice to book it to vegas in february of 2010 . he chose ' a special memory ' for his ceremony and everything went great on my end as a guest . our chapel room seated a good 40-50 , was clean , nice , and there were a few cute places to take pictures outside . i ca n't comment on prices or customer service , but knowing my brother , it must have been reasonable and the people obviously did n't piss him off ... they 're still standing .	3867
1	the service is excellent , and everything that we had was delicious . we asked for medium spice level and that was just right because the food has a kick without losing its incredible flavor . we were in town for a few days and had dinner here more than once . my friend and i decided that i 'd we lived in vegas , we would probably eat here at least once a week !	600
1	pima pool 's did a great job fixing our leak in a timely fashion and the price was reasonable with no hidden charges . i would recommend pima pools - jack is a great person to talk with and knows the pool business .	2925
0	i purchased carpet from home depot 8 years ago . the carpet was installed by western states . i recently contacted home depot to have my carpet in 2 bedrooms re-stretched . western states can over and looked at the carpet . home depot contacted me about the cost . western states gave home depot an ok price on the re-stretch , however , they wanted $ 100.00 to move each piece of furniture . chocked , i contact another business . was quoted a better price and there was no charge on furniture . i was able to move small stuff myself and had only a few larger pieces , but really , a $ 100.00 each ?	1379
0	disappointed that they offered a special but were out of it , even though we arrived early on a saturday evening . also disappointed that our waiter was not informed until after four people in my party ordered it . waiter was very friendly and courteous , but he was running ragged ( they needed more staff ) , and the wait for drinks and then food was too long . i liked the atmosphere . in addition , my credit card was hacked at this place .	951
1	amazing to see a wine bar and local brew pub at a safeway , with a couple of flat screens tuned to football . why did n't i think of that years ago ? i 'd be rich now . only complaint is that the deli and bar are at opposite sides of the store . an idea whose time has come .	1097
0	the sevince lead can not even tell me as first in line.. 2hour min wait..went to lunch ? ? ?	3825
1	sands expo hosted adobe max and it was well oiled experience . facilities were mostly modern and refreshed with temp staff everywhere to assist with directions and guidance . conference seats were comfortable and a/c was strong . dessert air is very dry so be sure to bring some lotion , chapstick , and a humidifier too ! bathrooms were well stocked with paper towels , facial tissues ! be prepared for lots of walking so bring comfortable shoes !	587
0	i went here for breakfast today and was not impressed . i have been in the past for bagels , which are great , but my breakfast was inedible . i ordered the california omelet which came with a latke and a bagel . the omelet was very overcooked and dry . i took one bite and could n't eat any more . the bagel and latke were good . i could have saved some money and just ordered those . will not come back for the dine in breakfast until they learn how to cook eggs !	325
0	the best thing going was the shuttle to and from the strip . not really any amenities , no restaurants bar , etc . one washer and dryer which was fine because we were the only ones doing laundry . free wifi was only in the lobby or if your room was close enough to the lobby . staff was so-so , depending in who was at the desk . overall , would i stay here again ? probably not if there was availability at another resort through my timeshare , but again , the shuttle was helpful !	3091
0	i 'm not a fan of a company that leaves the flowers at a neighbors house and leaves a sign on the door to go 5 doors down . we never got the flowers ... .	38
1	well i throughly enjoyed my pedicure ! the man with the glasses was amazing , very thorough and took his time . i was serviced soon as i walked in . the music they played was very mice and relaxing . the salon was clean and organized . comfortable atmosphere and great service . wish i lived closer because i would definitely come back .	3117
0	every time i call to place an order i get attitude , bad service and most times told 1.5-2 hour wait time . food is good most of the time but you guys need to either hire some people or stop delivering if you ca n't manage to figure it out . some how the other pizza places can manage to provide actual service with a good attitude . if you were a hole in the wall discount pizza dive i might cut you some slack , but you charge 20-30 a pizza and 5.00 to deliver ... hire some people who can show a little care for the customer .	192
0	not : this place only offers organic wine . overall very average . we were really looking forward to a great meal and wine tasting pairings ; but just got very average wine and average cold tapas . cold bread . tapas were too salty or too bland or too oily ... although service was very good ! but no consideration on food and wine pairing . no wow effect at all . just overall disappointed .	461
0	been going here since they open on the corner of mcclintock and east guadalupe in tempe . absolutely the best fresh chinese you 'll find anywhere . the owner is very friendly and greets and chats with most customers . if you become a repeat customer , expect to be greeted with a welcoming smile . it 's unfortunate that he lost the lease in tempe just after the 1st of the year , but they are open again at their new location 4030 w ray rd e1 , chandler , az stop by and give them a try you wo n't be disappointed . update 1/16/13 since moving the portions have shrunk , the prices have risen and the quality also has slipped .	474
0	no ordenen x telefono , ! la putilla que responde nada mas ladra ! `` no se escucha nada '' y te cuelga el telefono !	571
1	i just moved back to huntersville from the northlake area so i had to find somewhere new . i am glad i came to this place . i love the sns nails , no other salon i 've been too has it . i will defiantly be going here more often and glad i gave them a shot . everyone working was very nice	3603
0	i purchased the groupon for a 2 hour cleaning . it was definitely not worth the $ 59 . i 'm giving them two stars based on how nice jan was on the phone . the maid also seemed very friendly . but , the cleaning job was pretty bad . we were told to leave a list of items that we would like prioritized . i went over the list with the maid . the first thing on the list was to clean the bathrooms . she did not even accomplish this . i also saw that she left my house 10 minutes early . pretty disappointing .	2854
0	my wife told me about this so i decided to check it out . i walked in and was not acknowledged for over twenty minutes . nobody said hi or are you waiting on someone . granted it was a little busy but i counted at least four barbers just chilling .	2467
0	my juice was essentially water with a little taste of celery . most expensive glass of water i 've ever bought . will not return .	3026
1	gladis is seriously the best barber in town ! i have never had a cut that i was n't completely satisfied with .	2677
1	we have been coming here for 20+ years . even though this restaurant is in scarborough , it is lose enough to north york . a very quiet getaway.. the view is intriguing .	422
0	waste of money . the maze takes 10-15 mins max ! the laser maze is beyond lame . huge waste of time and money !	3060
0	the uptown location is awful . we ordered wings , bbq chicken pizza ( no onions ) and garlic knots . the estimated arrival time was 45 minutes . an hour and a half later we called the location and were told that they `` forgot to print our ticket out '' and that the order would be no charge . another 45 minutes later and our order finally showed up . they forgot our garlic knots , and we were charged for the order . this location is lucky that it is conveniently placed with this kind of service . we will never use this location again . **forgot to mention that our pizza had onions on it . disgusting .	902
1	came in for an oil change . they quoted an hour but had the work done in 30 minutes . spoke with west who informed me of a $ 15 coupon they had .	1297
1	5 stars ! delicious , clean , friendly waitstaff , and not too pricey . place was packed with locals , and i can see why . if i lived in vegas i 'd go often ! had a vegetarian noodle dish . still dreaming about it ...	673
1	after being treated badly at bell lexus decided to visit arrowhead . very pleased with arrowhead lexus . megan and fran were wonderful , were very patient and willing to help in any way possible . if you are looking for a new lexus see fran .	3065
0	who leaves watermelon in 106° wicked vegas heat ? ? ? ? and when i asked an employee why is the watermelon outside hot & rotting away her response was im not in charge of what corporate says	3499
0	yogurt is good but customer service was lacking severely . the lady did not come out until i was standing at the register , and she said next to nothing and was very cold . i did n't feel welcome .	1454
1	jimmy and greg and all the other guys at this shop once again rocked it for me ! they took care of setting my air conditioner right so i would n't fry in this desert heat . thanks guys ! ! you 're all rockstars in my book ! !	2960
0	i am really confused of the high ratings of this place . my experience was awful . 1.the cashier had math problems of a less than $ 10 check . 2 . food is mediocre 3 . they charge you for extra napkins ... in a place where you need to eat with your hands ! 4 . they asked you to take out used toilet seat cover which is soaked in urine and dripping and throw it into trash can because it will clog the toilet . ugh ... seriously ?	1566
1	5 stars all around	254
1	staff friendly , overall very clean restaurant , food was fast and great tasting ... ... .manager justin very upbeat , people person ... we will be back ! ! thanks	1340
0	i 'm usually more apt to patronize a family-owned business , but when i go to an italian place i hope to see an italian doing the cooking . same thing for any other type of `` ethnic '' restaurant . the food was okay - nothing that authentic , which was no surprise . service was fair , saiad bland ( clearly not locally grown ) and the main course lukewarm . i was hoping for a neighborhood feel but it just seemed `` put on '' . i 'll spend my money elsewhere next time . there is much better italian in town , especially for the price and quality .	368
0	ordered samosa . pakora and papri chaat for a total of 20 $ cad which i consider quite steep for the exprience . samosa was had a new spice flavour which did not bode well . pakora was too dense and was not well prepared . papri chaat was acceptable however had the same spice flavour noticed earlier in the samosa , also it was missing chopped onions and green chilies which is similar to having salsa with out tomatos or onions . food was below average however resturant was clean and well kept . most of the patrons were non tradational which could be explained by the kind of indian food rendition this place touts . will not visit again once was more than enough .	537
0	i am so disappointed on their sisig the service is slow.. no dont go here	817
1	. i had a spray tan a few weeks ago . my first spray ever ..i came in with questions . she answered all my questions n also giving me additional information on how to keep my tan . . initially i thought it was a bit dark . she told me it would lighten up after i shower ( within 8 hours ) . . i left it on for about 7 hours . i was amazed at the result . i absolutely fell in love with tan . it covered a lot of my scars . and one thing i love the most . i look skinnier . i 'm a happy customer .	3353
0	i understand mistakes happen , but i have had poor customer service with even the service department taking 4 hours to change the oil on my car . the number provided was not `` disconnected '' . larry miller has reached me several times to follow up with me after i purchased my vehicle . this dealership seems to be the only one not able to reach me . the check issue was not handled correctly . if an incorrect check was written , i am surprised it took a week for the mistake to be realized . nonetheless , i have no ties to arrowhead honda and for that i am thankful .	2210
1	my best experience in the many times i 've been to this nordstrom was recently with the ladies at the purse counter . typically i feel like most people who works retail in scottsdale feels like they 're entitled to be dickheads . these women proved me wrong -- in just a matter of minutes , i felt they were honestly helping me find the right bag for me , not up selling , and even encouraged me to order the one i wanted versus caving for one i was n't quite sold on . they made personalized conversation and seemed genuinely happy to help . wish i could say the same for everyone else i see at nordstrom .	1907
0	if i could give them zero stars i would.. super unprofessional , horrible customer service , nails suck ! .. i 've been getting my nails done for years so i know what a fill means juan did my nails and did a horrible job ! ! i have streak marks , my nail is cracked just horrible ! ! ! he was sitting on the right hand side second desk	3260
1	this place is sorta hidden but the food is amazing . the price is very reasonable for the quality and amount that is served . i got the ono wings with garlic fried rice and i really recommend it . it definitely has a nice brunch vibe that i can see my friends and i hanging out in in the mornings .	57
1	everytime we get into pittsburgh late at night - this is our first stop . i love this bar , i ca n't wait to be back next week !	3840
0	walked in on a sunday morning . place was pretty busy but several tables were open . we sat there for about 15 minutes . nobody approached us . an older gentleman , who is obviously a regular came in after us and was waited on and given coffee . lots of staff shooting the breeze with regulars , nobody approached us . mind you , this is not a big place . when we thought about how long it 's taking to get waited on , how long would it be until we were eating . we left . unless you 're a regular do n't wast your time .	406
0	the place was n't very busy , but the two servers were all over the place . the portions were much smaller than another location i usually frequent and done somewhat carelessly ( e.g . the toast has a small patch of butter in a corner , fruit badly cut , almost no hollandaise sauce on the small crepomelet ) . unlikely i 'll go to this location again .	1060
1	sweet find ! the local hotel was closed for renovations so we booked a room here and were so pleased we are going to stay here from now on ! fully furnished and supplied kitchen , 2 full bedrooms and an open den with a sofa bed upstairs . there were only 2 of us so it was more than enough room . we did n't stay long enough to enjoy the pool but on the next trip we are all in ! booked through booking.com . no issues with reservations .	3803
0	yuck . this was the worst pho i have ever had . bad broth , ugly meat , wilted veggies . service was awful . the dude up front was coughing violently , and blowing his nose . go to khai hoan . i feel sick right now and may have food poisoning- -update i definitely got food poisoning from pho all seasons-	1260
1	i ca n't believe i left such a short review last time ! this is a small mom and pop owned place in a strip mall . they employees are super friendly and they cook the food right behind the counter . the cheese steaks are to die for ! just like being in philly . sauce , no sauce , wiz , extra wiz , you name it , they 'll make it ! the interior is small but there are tables chairs and booths to sit in if you do n't do take out . this is my go to place for all things cheesesteaks ! will recommend and return ! ! ! i 've found my philly fix !	777
1	nascar kobalt 400 was amazing and now the races will arrive in las vegas twice each year .	2955
1	love skin gravy . i bought a groupon and was very skeptical but i have had wonderful services and do not have one complaint . i do have to say my last service which was the dermaplanning was my favorite . my make-up has never looked so good , it goes on so much smoother and stays on longer . highly recommend skin gravy and all of the ladies that work there	1618
1	i went to a wedding here last weekend and wow . such a cool place near where i live and work . family owned is a plus . check them out . a little traffic noise from the main road but the gorgeous atmosphere makes up for it .	238
1	yay ! i found a new nail place by my house ! i get a full set with gel polish and a gel pedicure . hope was awesome ! great at what she does and super friendly ! i think i finally found my nail girl to be loyal to ! ! there is a happy hour on mondays and tuesdays so you get a little discount . they are my days off so it works perfectly for me .	3047
1	i like this mall , , has a lots of clothes , shoes and everything that i want , i am very happy when i go there , , , ,	2815
0	never coming to this joann again i usually go to the one in mesa river view the employee becca was so rude . terrible customer service .	3876
0	doctors seem fine but if you are planning to have an `` on time '' appointment , even if you are scheduled first thing in the morning , beware . this office never runs on time and has no respect for their patient 's calendar or time . always at lease one hour late with no explanation .	2312
0	portions were very small for the price point . i paid $ 15 for a large poke bowl that was barely the size of my fist . toppings were also small . i left the resultant $ 15 in the hole and still hungry . also : why is avocado always extra ? all in all , i 'm never going to big tuna again .	309
1	mesa fully formed recently helped my mother-in-law with a countertop . she said they have a beautiful showroom , professional sales people , skilled installers and were reasonably priced . she was very happy with the service she received .	3875
1	my husband and i thought we would check out this yummy organic local spot because the reviews seemed good and loved there menu . the food was amazing and the service was even better . there hummus is some of the best ive ever had . i would definitely recommend checking this spot out .	1402
1	i called to get my car towed by this company after i popped 2 of my tires . they were sure to keep me updated on their arrival when the office called to let me know eta . then , the driver also called when he was 10 mins away . they were fast & efficient & let me ride in the car . larry and jr were very friendly and funny . it was $ 75 for the 2.6mi drive + $ 5 tax or something . thank you guys !	2931
0	first cheese dog was completely uncooked inside . they reheated this one saying `` if you want a more cooked one i put it in the oven '' . this is the second one and it 's still not completely cooked .	551
1	i purchased a groupon as a gift for my wife who has always wanted to learn to knit . . my wife loved the store and the environment that seems to foster learning and group project help . she attended the basic knitting class . the class was a well sized group of 8 students and the instructor gave very personalized instruction and training to every student.. she was organized , patient and cognizant of the fact that this was a basic knitting class where for many if not all students this was their first experience at knitting . this is truly a great example of a wonderful small business that puts the customer first .	2946
1	it was absolutely delicious ! very down-home , friendly atmosphere , and a huge menu that 'll please anyone ( even a veggie section ! ) we had breakfast only , but all of the lunch and dinner specials looked amazing . sausage links are killer , and my western omelette was on point . hearty serving sizes too , with reasonable prices . first time there , and wo n't be the last !	213
1	so far i really like this school ! very homey , the staff are so welcoming and helpful ! i am a single mom with a full time job so the blended scheduled and night classes work out perfectly !	3073
0	really bad food . twice i went ask for thai hot but it was blend no test . do not recommend .	895
1	this place had good reviews , so came here for an oil change . the customer service was amazing ! mark was so nice and helpful . would definitely come back again !	2392
1	great products and service . i always send my clients here . excellent trade partner for designers and builders	3426
1	went the other day and was blown away . service has improved so much in the little amount of time since i have been there ! ordered the mac and cheese burger and it was delicious . they brought out fries for us to snack on while we waited for our burgers , which only took around 10 minutes to come out . our server was attentive and took care of us really well . so happy that this red robin location seems to be on the right track ! ! !	1323
1	my business used to be located within walking distance to chiwas and not a day goes by that i do n't miss them . my absolute favorite menu item is their award winning beans , which i believe has made this place a destination spot . another must-try is the rajas gordita . no other description besides i 'm sorry you have n't already tried it . chiwas ' instagram account is always updated which is important for me as a customer . service is genuine and kind and the owners are super cool . 5 stars is n't enough !	270
0	foot massage ? ha , it was like a cotton candy ball being thrown at my feet . then they charged me twice . worst pedicure i have had .	854
1	it 's my favorite . we get our barf/raw catfood from there . it can be expensive , but generally speaking they carry a better product . they have a wonderful cheese selection too . do n't let them use a 1000 bags at checkout . they will put 2 items in one plastic bag . i 've been meaning to speak to the manager about this ...	433
0	communal seating in the land of douche bag and baggets ? yeah ... no thanks ! walked out of this place and went next door to the ship .	630
0	so i decided to give this place another shot super bowl sunday . had a couple of beers and the chips/queso . well , it was some white cheese with tons of garlic . no tomato 's or anything else . they apparently do have live music now on fri and sat but of course their website is never updated to show who the entertainment is . okay place for a beer/sports close to home , but i 'd say just eat before you go .	1241
1	main thing this place is clean ! ! ! friendly staff , got a pedi done here and was great , only problem the paint on my nails chipped about 4 hours later . ( disappointed )	2148
0	worst experience ever both times i 've came to this location . do n't even bother ordering online because i guarantee it wo n't be ready by the promised time . the only reason why i came back was because the new general manager was professional and apologetic .	1365
0	the rooms we 're not kept clean when we ask for housekeeping twice they told us they 're understaffed could not get to us were disappointed at this establishment	1041
1	okay but not as good as it use to be . the service has went downhill and with many more restaraunts being better priced and better staffed it makes sense to go some where else . they use to have huge cake and great prices but they do not anymore	1319
1	disclaimer , this is about the drive thru and not inside as we were just picking up some donuts for the road . donuts were exceptional as i do n't believe you can really have bad donuts unless they are n't hot , which these were and the service was fairly fast .	1131
1	this was the nicest , cleanest group of bikers that i have ever met . the cars and bikes are amazing .	2978
0	lousy over zealous life grds . wo n't even let you float on your back . lifeguards are power monger idiots here ! i was a 10 year lifeguard and they are not trained or professional .	349
1	grade scale 1-5 cupcakes all around 4 taste 5 presentation 4 some flavors are n't a very good idea . wonderful presentation and taste . the cupcake review	3671
0	really an average course that was fairly easy . the bummer was no beverage cart when we played saturday and it was 100 . i would not golf here again .	3106
1	i 've frequently stopped here on my way out of charlotte and have always had good service . this morning was no exception . ordered the southern breakfast , which was to be 2 scrambled eggs , so i asked for 2 more . what i got appeared to be 7-8 eggs . i be full now ! # dontwastetheprotien thanks for the consistent good service .	1400
0	the food is good but service not so much . if you place an online order do n't expect it to be ready at your scheduled time , usually 15 mins after the fact with some errors . literally not one employee smiled or seemed happy during my wait at this location , i know they 're busy but i 'm concerned for them . they 're clearly not happy . management should evaluate how they 're doing because it 's not reflecting on their employees .	1365
1	go ta deal here thru hotwire . pretty solid hotel . there is an indoor swimming pool possibly heated and small gym here which is workable . the hotel is very nice inside . the staff was excellent ! the room was very clean and comfortable . one thing to note is the towels are not as soft and the ac is old style . other than that we did not complain as there was no issues . stayed for 2 nights and it was good . easy check in and check out . staff was excellent !	2795
0	went through car wash and rinse was not working . told management then went through again to rinse off soap . still not working , poor customer service and equipment	2939
1	scottsdale cab company has been the most reliable car and taxi service i 've found in the area . the online booking form makes reservations easy . i can always count on prompt and courteous service , a professional and personable driver , and a great experience getting where i need to get . scottsdale cab company always goes the extra mile for its customers !	52
1	stopped in for a beer and a snack after a long hot day of exploring the local area . staff was friendly , had a great beer selection , and a good menu for happy hour foods . the bartender let us sample several of the beers that we had n't tried before and was helpful and attentive as we made our selections . i like the sports bar in a barn type theme , combined with the service and great beer selection . we 'd like to go back when we can spend more time and not have to worry about driving after a couple of beers .	211
0	honestly one of the worst places to get your car worked on . took it in for a realignment and they purposely busted my cv axel , which takes a lot of effort to do . once that was busted , they came to me and said that i needed to be fixed and was going to charge me . ridiculous !	2212
0	really nice hotel , but they tried charging for wifi . this is 2015 , and i 'm told this place opened in the last few years , so this is unacceptable . i wo n't be staying here again , but i 'll look for an equally nice hotel that has joined the 21st century .	3859
1	great popcorn and an extremely friendly staff . seats are comfortable and the theatre is clean !	3680
0	they were not very nice . would not substitute any meats for other meats ( as i do n't eat prok and there is a ton of pork on the menu ) . they also would not make our food into a burrito like the menu said it would at no cost . would not come back	1317
0	i saw the way they handled a fellow customers situation and it was embarrassing and unprofessional . there are plenty of sushi spots in vegas , i will take my business elsewhere..	408
0	if i could give zero stars i would . worst rude service ever ! ! ! the worker kept skipping me and kept serving others than came after me . my kids and i wanted to try flavors but ignored us , then rushed us when we finally got his attention to sample some flavors , but before i opened my mouth to say our order , he looks the other people that came after us and took their order instead . not even worth our time and my money . there are better gelato places in vegas that have better kinder service that have patience to deliver true customer service . do n't waste your time here	3735
0	just went to the new restaurant in chandler was so looking forward to it and complete disappointment ! expensive cafeteria style . yuck great way to ruin french food .	1276
1	i used to get my car washed here before the owner/name change . i stopped by this past weekend and i was so happy to see dana working here again . she is always so thorough and pays attention to details . i came back from a road trip and had a bunch of dead bugs all over the grill and windshield , she took the time to scrub them so that they would for sure be removed in the wash ! great employee ! do not get rid of her ! !	1502
0	this review is solely based off of one bartender . the bartender with dreads to the floor was the worst bartender of all time . he yelled at multiple customers . he got in an argument with a customer for 15 minutes while everyone else waited for drinks . he acted like every customer was a nuisance ( to be fair , one guy was super drunk and annoying ) . he complained about how many hours he had to work . i would have expected more patience from a man that 's been growing his hair for 10+ years . dude should be a vacuum salesman because he sucks . oh , and the ice was gross .	279
1	not in the greatest area of vegas but i 've never been dissatisfying here . the food is always fresh and fast . the service is always friendly and upbeat ! ! the parking lot is always clean and the garbage cans are never full ! !	994
1	by far the best massage place i 've ever been to ! ! ! i discovered this place a little over a year ago and i absolutely love it and will never go anywhere else . they are professional , clean , and have a great vip rewards program with awesome incentives . i always see lisa . she 's such an amazing masseuse ! she always takes care of every inch of my body and is extremely good at what she does . i highly recommend sam 's spa , if ever you 're in need of a relaxing and satisfying massage .	2320
0	worst slowest service ever . not staffed for busy time 10 cars backed up w/ only 4 people working the finish line . left before my car was done - back to work . never again	127
0	i was supposed to have my very first obgyn appt . tomorrow with dr. tyre which was confirmed by her scheduling assistant when she returned my call to schedule me 3 weeks ago . unfortunately , i needed to cancel and reschedule my appt . only when i called they informed me i had no appt . and was not scheduled in their system for the appt . i was confirmed for . pretty upsetting to hear and what a waste of my time . i would not recommend this office . i am glad i was able to get a referral to dr. michelle lewis and they were able to get my first pregnancy obgyn appt scheduled right away .	3059
0	really , i came to watch the steelers not get robbed by the price of parking and beer . what a joke . 9.50 for 1 16 oz beer . crooks .	2199
1	today was my first visit here ! great spa ! beautiful and clean ! the employees are professional and welcoming ! thanks for the locals discount too ! alyssa was my therapist and she did an awesome job ! loved my day at the pool and spa ! thanks for the relaxing , great day !	2651
1	the skin center is incredible ! ! from the moment i walked in , i felt that i was the star of the show . i went to both the mount lebanon office and wexford . the reception ladies were very welcoming and sweet . i had no wait at all and was serviced at my appointment time . louis performed laser hair removal for me and it has been life changing ! she is a true professional and super sweet . but i am truly amazed at my results , i pretty much never have to shave and i have only done three treatments . i 'm also amazed at the variety of therapies they offer there . thanks skin center ! !	3731
0	this is a dive bar . we were killing time before a wedding receoption and this place was next to where the reception was going to be held . i would not recommend this place to anyone . it 's just not my thing . it 's old and dark .	2818
1	food was excellent , service was amazing ! got the good bad and ugly i must say it was delicious . my server nikita was the best , she made sure i had everything i needed and more ... the wife and i will be back with the kids next time though !	496
0	very very poorly done . sushi for the unwashed masses at best . you 'd do better at the local grocery store .	24
1	i like this mall because it 's less crowded than fashion . i bought a hoverboard from a kiosk at pv mall . i got a good deal and decided to go with the extended warranty . so far so good ! if you are looking for hoverboards , go here and ask for jack . he knew everything about it and was super helpful !	2815
1	ok , so i 'm biased . eaten a lot of duck around town but this is my favorite . best roasted duck won ton noodle soup ... ever ! flavorful , crispy skin , perfect noodles ... yummy . my other favorite that the rest of the table had was crispy kau chee mein w/cake noodles . got ta go with the cake noodles . good ole comfort foods .	1103
1	i had the cowboy burger and it was amazing , and with an unbeatable price ! the meat was also perfectly seasoned , so i probably would have been happy with just the simple hamburger . : d since i was in phoenix for a conference and had n't eaten vegetables for a couple of days , i decided to get the `` fresh garden salad '' . do n't do it ! it 's basically pre-packaged shredded lettuce with a few slices of cucumbers and tomatoes . could have spent those four bucks on another burger . ) ; the decor was super cute , and they were playing old songs like for the longest time and take on me !	1461
0	remember to bring quarters for the cart rental ... otherwise you will be buying what you can carry . bring your own bags or you will be using their reused boxes ... i think that is great ... but most people will throw them away when they get home . it would be better if aldi recycled instead . staff was friendly ... if you were the `` right '' type of people , but if you stick out from the local populace , you do n't even rate a hi or a thank you ... honestly	1824
1	michelle at this mac counter is the reason i switched back to mac makeup ... i used it for years and then got annoyed or overwhelmed by the whole make up counter process and started ordering make up online ... i came here with a friend a few days ago and a women named michelle helped us and she was so nice and so helpful and gave us tons of great tips for our skin and our make up she was hilarious and i did n't feel over sold or under informed at all . she is my make up angel i will be back to restock soon !	2409
1	so damn good ! i got the burrito with crab , spicy tuna and shrimp for protein , cucumber , green onion , crunch and spicy mayo as the filler . amazing . great price too .	129
1	this is the best barbershop in town ! im born and raised here and this is the only shop ill come to . always get a perfect cut and pepe and eddie are great .	761
0	two shuttles drove right by me leaving lot . on pickup from airport guy waited 15 seconds , pulled 5 ' away from curb to leave , and i ran to the van and he literally said he could n't open the door since he had pulled away from curb . i 've never had a worse parking experience . hot ( no ac ) shuttles . one exit lane open takes **forever** to cash out ! ! ! !	2531
0	the waitresses were really rude and barely refilled our drinks . i ate with a couple friends and one of them did n't eat , they just had a water but the waitresses felt the need to keep staring us and it made us really uncomfortable . the food was n't anything too special so you could say we are never coming back again .	1302
0	my experiences at aloha pacific were never good and never got better ! the manager ( vivian ) needs to acquire knowledge and management training ! everyone including people not of their race should be treated the same , such is not the case here ! i will never go back and will let everyone i know about this so called establishment , and their very rude unhealthy practices !	1687
0	horrible barber shop . chicago ( barber ) charged me $ 40 dollars for a combover . just because it was a sunday . i had just showered prior and had lightly applied pomade . she gave me an unnecessary hair wash. horrible side fade and did n't want to give me a lineup . do n't recommend this barbershop ! ! !	2295
0	this doctor ( furo oruene ) has to be the worst ! unprofessional beyond comprehension ! ! constantly bragging about his house , the money spent on his girlfriends shoes and the air condition bill . extremely unpleasant and ego driven . injecting the knee with a minimum amount of medication ; then claiming the knee is healed . unfortunately , the orthopedic specialist ; whom i went too would completely disagree with this quack ! ! i definitely would not recommend this quack to my enemy ! ! what do doctors do with their mistakes ? ? ? they bury them ! ! ! !	1780
0	called these guys up for an inspection and they tried to charge me $ 825 for a one time spray ! ? or $ 600 upfront and $ 114 for first spray then $ 38 a month after . i do n't know how these guys are still in business with these prices ... no thanks	302
1	the atmosphere and people are amazing ! the best service i have received . clean , fun , friendly , and great guacamole . it was my birthday and originally expected to go to another location but i am extremely happy we stumbled on this location . they went above and beyond good customer service and that is why i rated them so high . if you have not tried their guac please do , its made every 4 hours and is delicious .	1558
1	it is quick , simple and delicious . wow- favorite brunch upto now . the coffee was fresh and has a very nice aroma . loved it . next it came with six side dishes with different flavor and bread . out of these six , rosemary jam , cream cheese with herbs and beef slices with mozzarella was awesome . then the main dish which was omelette with beef sausage , it was yummy . all in all , my favorite brunch in downtown toronto ! !	720
0	if you want to experience a cattle run , go to shepherd eye center . you 'll wait for long periods of time between each `` station '' . i waited a total of over two hours . now looking for another eye doctor as i wo n't go back . my time is worth something , too ! i 'm only giving it one star as i had no other choice . i would have given shepherd eye center zero stars .	1635
0	poor and useless equipment not in condition . whom ever is the manager and makes decisions is not suited for the job . there 's been missing dumbbells for weeks you have to go from 55 to 75 to use the same dumbbells . very sad because when bigger gyms come in to area this will probably go out of business when all they had to do was take better care of the facility and decision making . fyi the training staff are the only thing working here jlo ! ! !	2919
1	amazing coffee selection ; bakery selection is fab as well . prices are much better than starbucks for sure ! ! !	3520
0	cash registers went offline as i was in the check out line . the staff had no clue what to do and just said they ca n't sell anything ! ughhhh . just close the front doors then too !	3199
0	i do n't know if it 's the tourists or if it 's the location but expect to wait in line for those 3 soft tacos or super size burito ... this place as a line .	214
0	went to vegas for my 21st so i planned on drinking everything in sight . my mother purchased a groupon with tacos n rita 's for two 32oz frozen drinks and it was just flavored slushee , nothing boozey about it we had to add our own liquor to it because it was nothing but juice , wo n't be going back there on the 2nd trip to vegas	1071
1	great service and friendly staff ! got one of the best gel manicures i 've ever had ! i 'm just sad i do n't live in lv so i ca n't get my nails done here all the time ! !	2686
0	hesitantly giving one star because i cant give 0 ! ! this place is ridiculous , you ca n't bring your purses in , ca n't be in a party more than 2 people ? even after we put our purses in these lockers by the door we still got followed around ! not to mention the actual service was terrible- the person timing is up would n't leave a prior conversation with some customer that she was helping before and did n't even say hello or goodbye ! this place is super close to my home but i will never return ! i 'd rather drive fourth minutes out of my way to the beauty supply warehouse !	1659
0	it 's alright place when it 's open to get quick accessory or check the b . unfortunately the store has been closed with `` paper indicating reasons '' . in general- the business aspect of this place is weak and selection non-existent .	2414
0	worst customer service ever and the food frankly is n't worth the wait . barely any cream cheese and the bagels are hard as a rock . same your time and money and skip this place .	477
1	live nearby and tried them for happy hour and was very pleasantly surprised . we had heard mixed reviews before so were n't too sure . anyway we all liked the items we ordered , especially the beef brisket sliders ! our server , erica , was great and took time to explain the menu . will definitely go back .	1529
0	i had a salad with berries and bad dressing and it took them 20 minutes to make it . several people who ordered after me including my lunch companion got their food way before me . and i did n't have any meat on mine so i 'm not sure what took so long . i eventually asked for it and it was brought out . i was very excited initially when this place opened but overall i am incredibly unimpressed . the only good thing was the drink options . they had real cane soda and other good options . but i do n't go to restaurants for the sodas . i wo n't go back . too many great options in ballantyne .	1269
1	amazing atmosphere , friendly employees , wonderful coffee and decent pastry . dropped by once a while ago , now i am here almost regularly .	3184
1	just ate here for the first time in about a year . workers were super friendly and we got our food really fast ! only downside was most of the tables that were n't occupied were not clean . went outside to the patio to find a clean table and most of those were dirty as well . otherwise great service and a good lunch !	484
0	no water . also they wasted a lot of plastic . great people and venue . just no water . and no sustainability .	2187
0	you will find that this place is the same place as bonds house of cutlery . customer service is sub-par and their add is definitely fake that was posted on backpage . was not impressed by the guy wearing 8 knives on him or him telling me `` yeah '' when i asked for assistance looking for a particular product . i will not come back here or spend any money in this place .	2927
0	this place is horrible . my hotdogs were basically raw as well as the bacon . the carne asada is n't even chopped and to top it of the clearly have not understanding of customer service . never again will i eat from dump again ! ! !	797
1	i came here as a kid and now i bring my 2 kids . dr weiner is amazing by far best doctor in las vegas he is knowledgeable and always gives me a diagnosis . not your typical `` may be a cold '' dr. staff is nice as well wait is never too bad at all just like any doctor office you go to . so worth it to see dr weiner and dr muyot is good as well .	2298
1	this is obviously one of my regular hangouts . it 's close to home , so it 's my favorite late night spot . excellent service & food . my favorite server is christy , who is super sweet & beautiful . my favorite bartenders are brady & alex . prices are reasonable & they have a great happy hour !	1520
0	lately , their arrival times have been inaccurate and delayed ... also , they keep changing their pickup locations and it seems like they added more pickups along the way and more random stops , which maybe creates more of a delay in actual arrival times .	3132
0	prices are often at least 30 % higher than other grocery stores in the area , and the quality of any non-brand-name items is low . the product selection here is much lower than other stores in the area as well . i only shop here when i need something in a pinch , but often leave with a broken bank on even the smallest of orders . do not recommend .	495
0	this place is always crowded and dirty ! meat and seafood smells so bad i literally gagged when i turned around to see what smelled so awful . it was a bucket of pigs nose and feet in blood . lines are extremely long and no one speaks english ! ! the only good things are the sushi and hot table .	2069
1	thank you to the my local hardware store for recommending apache glass . i needed a replacement for glass for my stairway light . not sure her name but the office person who sits towards to front door is friendly and knew what i needed . above all she also took my ideas i got consideration . the person working the shop who cut my glass also was friendly and knew what i needed . it 's rare in today 's customer facing world to find a business which operates like this . i highly recommend apache glass and their staff . i read some of the reviews about pricing and would say they were reasonable considering they are a specialty company .	3589
1	came in friday 10/24/14 . got there before it opened because of what i 've read on previous yelp reviews . once we got in i waited for about an hour , but it was totally worth the wait . i got my cut by martin . told him what i wanted even showed him some pics and he nailed it ! i 've gotten several compliments since . they do n't rush it . will definitely come back soon !	3574
0	avoid this location at all cost . if you need anything more than basic deposits and withdrawals , go to another branch . i 'm speaking from a lot of experience and keep thinking the service ca n't be this bad consistently but it is ! go to the branch right up the street and you 'll get completely different service	1533
1	i like great clips . their prices are reasonable , they have coupons often , i never have to wait long , i can ( now ) check on online , and their computer system remembers what the stylist did last time so i do n't have to explain it to whoever is working that day . it 's just a no-hassle place to get a decent haircut . nothing fancy . every one in a while i get a stylist that does n't listen well , or does n't do exactly what i want ... but i 've never left there feeling like they completely botched the job . if you 're sick of paying for expensive haircuts , give these guys a shot .	3565
0	horrible service . nail techs barely spoke english , the owners speak english but the female is rude , obnoxious , and defensive . do not get gel/shellac nails here . they do not know how to take them off , they use a drill that will thin your nails . they lack knowledge and talk crap in vietnamese . lack of professionalism . they do n't even buff your nails . owner spends more time on her ipad and iphone and makes faces when she has to provide service herself , grow up or close shop ! ! ! way better nail shops for the same price .	3040
1	first time at infinity and was very pleased . the entire atmosphere was fresh and inviting . the employees all had smiles and were so attentive to everything . darren was my specialist and he has done such an amazing job . i 'm officially a fan of infinity and especially darren . will come here again for sure .	2297
1	i have been to their estrella and suprise locations . deb mescher is an excellent pa , bubbly , smart and caring . really takes time to answer questions . i took away a star because i think the staff could do a better job introducing themselves by name and their title so you k ow who you 're talking to . everyone is friendly . i prefer the suprise location , parking is easier and the office is more welcoming .	2987
1	went there for weekend brunch . got the traditional breakfast with bacon and side salad . the side salad was pretty bland , but everything else on the plate was good . i also ordered a banana pancake which tasted sooo good . it was light , fluffy and not too sweet . the syrup had a really nice banana flavour to it . next time , i may just order a full plate of the banana pancakes .	273
0	think the food will be good ... if it ever gets here . one waitress working a crowd of about 100 customers . i get that it must go in spurts due to flights , but this is extraordinarily bad . do n't come if you 're hungry .	219
0	i kept hearing about how amazing the butternut squash soup was so i decided to try it out . i was pretty disappointed considering it did n't really taste that good . they used a combination of spices that overpowered and did not compliment the squash at all . i 'll go back , but i wo n't be trying the butternut squash again .	59
1	have been getting a long streak of mediocre to bad service lately in the area but texas road house service and food never disappoints ! great service , great food.. definitely recommend this location ! i believe our servers name was sarah c. i 'm sure we 'll be back more often to this location !	1491
1	today i had a problem with a battery i bought at this location a year ago . i walked in and gene one of the service writers attend to the problem immediately . i got a new battery and was out of there in less than 30 minutes and gene could not have been more helpful or courteous . thank you gene , joe novelli	959
1	a late night dessert run with my pregnant bestie led to a monty 's revelation : they now serve ( organic , classy ) sassy cow ice cream , have even nicer and more delectable cheesecakes and their brownie sundae puts the ella 's sparkled kazoo to shame . post-brownie sundae , bestie 's baby to-be kicked . i think it was the hot fudge .	975
1	i came in on a whim to get my nostril pierced , and immediately felt welcomed into the shop . everyone was super friendly and they took me back right away after filling out the necessary paperwork . my piercer , vince , was extremely friendly and professional . he did an amazing job and i highly recommend him . thank you to everyone working there for making my experience so great !	825
1	reasonably priced . nice self vacuum areas . i would be a return customer	2939
1	absolutely anyone and everyone that is looking for new window installation really needs to give window world a call . they were referred to me from another real estate agent and so we called them . remarkably window world 's estimate was about half the price of home depot . today they finished their installation of our home , all of our windows , and i can not say enough good things about them . aj was the representative and he is wonderful . the installers came out and spent the entire day and they were very courteous very clean and very organized . they did a remarkable job ! these guys are five star all the way !	2812
0	we called for a reservation 2 weeks in advance . we walked in and we 're told we did n't have a reservation because there was a party . i then asked them to check and one of the servers immediately said `` it 's impossible ! '' another server said he had no record of my call . they continued to treat meet like i was stupid for showing up . then another said she would look in the reservation book . and there it was for the next night ! no one was apologetic at all . do n't waste your time !	546
1	this is my favorite place for lunch , plenty of choices but i am always eat orange chicken .	1075
1	i did n't think the food was anything too above average , but the service was really great . the server helped us understand the menu and made it very clear what was vegan or not . i had the almond french toast which tasted good , but was pretty small and left me wanting more . my partner had the tofu scramble and it was n't anything i could n't make at home , but still good . however , they do offer vegan shakes which is so hard to find and that is my favorite thing about monty 's .	975
0	so i called sun valley auto this mourning around 10am talked to jeff tell me to come down they could get me in immediately for a oil change and ac charge , i get down there as fast as i can mind you i have twin babies and by myself today so i needed quick efficient service all that was said to me was the guys will be on lunch soon probably wont get to you for an hour or so.. thanks jeff for a complete waste of my time	565
0	they do n't check to make sure that the people who hired them own the safe that they are breaking into . i would n't trust them to open a child 's piggy bank .	3822
0	this place is a dump with bad instructors . andre hairston is the worst of them all . hairston is a piece of dog s # ! +	342
1	solid , nice , comfortable hotel with regular shuttles to the airport . great value for the money . front desk person , saira , knew her stuff and took care of us efficiently . just what we needed after a being stuck on airplane for 3 hours without leaving tarmac and then missing our connecting flight .	3503
1	it was our 1st time dining at b & b and we really enjoyed it . the food is great & the server , ally was terrific ! she was so personable as was the manager & owner . they spent time chatting which made it feel like we were regulars . the prime rib was something special . it is cold smoked for hours before final cooking which makes it super tender . we plan to visit again soon & often .	1529
1	i was worried about getting a tattoo right on fremont street , thinking that it might be a tourist trap lacking in quality . i was pleasantly surprised with an awesome experience . we happened to meet johnny at the door , explained what i wanted , he calmed my fears and turned me over to hannah who got me all set up . there was a bit of a wait , so hannah texted me when they were ready and bryan delivered exactly what i wanted . from beginning to end , it was a great experience and i would recommend them !	665
0	long lines , not very helpful . nobody really wants to help you . most of the walmart 's are busy but this one is just always full and the lines are just to long and nobody tries to open other lanes . very frustrating	2913
1	the manager here helped me with all the questions and concerns i had with acquiring a pet snake . i really enjoyed my experience here and the level of service he provided . it 's a small petco though , and i did n't see a wide variety of reptiles like i usually see at other stores . that was a little discouraging . i also have to point out , that this is the most immaculate petco i 've ever visited . it was literally spotless , and everything was tidy !	2174
0	staying at this location was horrible ! our bedsheets had stains on it and i hate to think what that was ! my entire trip was a mess from the sheet stains , crooked vents , dirt or grime in between the stove and countertop , dirt/dust over the doorway to the bathroom , and a small shower stall ! do n't think i 'd ever be staying here again !	1057
0	my wife and i have not attened the palm in awhile , due mostly to poor food.we had the chance to go last night to see a niel diamond impersonator , who was pretty good . the food that was served last night was terrible , worse then the last time we were there.my wife and i help feed the homeless at paz in mesa , and the food served there is better then we got last night .	2898
0	my mom wanted to go here for a hair cut so i took her . the price was decent but their customer service skills suck . they hardly cared about being friendly , and when their schedule was supposedly booked , the guy up front just said `` we do n't have time . '' the store also makes you feel like you 're living in the 80 's , but not the good kinda nostalgia ...	2915
1	this gym is awesome , i love the xgt classes they give me a full body workout at my own fitness level . tons of classes that work with my schedule and the staff here is amazing . carlos and ciara are really encouraging and the atmosphere is awesome . i quit la fitness to come here and it was well worth it . i would recommend it to anyone !	3298
0	beautiful pieces but not worth the investment because they are not functional as advertised . my bakeware broke in the oven less than 2 years after receiving it as a wedding gift and after asking for a replacement piece to due to the poor quality i was given proper care instructions . not worth the money unless you want to be buying new pieces every few years . i will be shopping elsewhere .	3012
0	absolutely the most pathetic pharmacy on the planet ! do not waste your time there , and believe me , they will waste your time and could care less about it ! i was needing a refil on a prescription and was put on hold for 25 minute 's before i hung up and called again . once more was put on hold and after another 10 minute 's left on hold i gave up . maybe i called at the wrong time , during business hour 's ! pathetic ! ! !	1733
1	great apartment complex with a considerate staff and great attention to detail . any issue that we had during our two years here was immediately taken care of by the office . great pool area , okay gym , nice landscaping . the apartments are great , though the paint on the walls leaves a lot to be desired , it 's pretty cheap . lots of room , and a pretty good price for the area . the few small issues that we experienced were n't enough to drop this from a five-star rating .	2832
0	i would give this place zero stars if i could . we waited 2 hours in an empty clinic . the only other person who was in the clinic had been waiting for 4 hours . there is only one vet on staff and it seems that each patients appointment takes 4 hours . understaffed and frustrating . we left before being seen and it looks like we made the right call given the other reviews about how costly and unprofessional this place is .	345
1	i thank-you rob , sabrina and your great staff for the service you offer , without you the compound medication would not be available readily and cost effective . thank- you !	2827
0	terrible food and atmosphere . horrible experience . do n't waste your time you are better off getting a frozen pasta meal at the grocery store and microwave .	620
1	the best pizza and it 's not even close . the price for a pie is high and worth every penny .	192
0	terrible place . nothing good to say , and we eat out all the time and are easy going . beautiful atmosphere and wine room but the wine came out bad . service was terrible and waited so long for water glasses to be filled , actually had to go to the bar for water refills . i had the chicken , guest had the fish . both were dryers out . like they had been precooked and under a heat lamp . and to end the night , the bill was $ 200.00 . they better work on their service and quality soon or we will looking at another scottsdale resturant available for rent .	1331
0	the singing bartenders should be splitting tips with the piano guy , they rally the crowd for tips and do n't get any of it ! ! ! so if you like the singer make sure you give your tip directly to the singer , does n't make sense for everyone not to pull tips	3326
0	they are no longer open for business . our friends had coupon they got off restaurant.com and we went to use it and found it closed .	567
0	i have tried this place on numerous occasions . never have they been a pleasure . and never had my car been cleaned to expectation . they always try to upsell and and make you feel guilty for getting the wash you want . i used them for an oil change once . my car leaked oil and they tried to blame my car , it was a brand new car and the first oil change . i would never recommend this car wash .	3250
1	today i took my son for the shoe tying class in the kids shoe department . what a nice free event ! kids sometimes learn better from other people and in less than 30 minutes my son was tying his shoes . jasmine worked with my son individually and had such care and patience . no one ever pushed buying any shoes , but i did decide to buy some converse with laces so he can keep practicing at home . the laces are kind of short so jasmine offered to swap out for some longer laces from a larger size shoe so he can practice better . such great service ! we love nordstrom and jasmine was such a sweet heart .	1907
0	doubled it 's prices for more meat.. i do n't need more meat..no more ... sorry whole foods .	1571
1	great target ! love the new displays and selection of items . customer service was great . plenty of parking . no complaints .	3259
1	came to toronto to visit my cousin and she took me here . it was a such a great place and our waitress was so kind and nice . i had the fish tacos and sweet potato fries with the truffle sauce . the truffle sauce was amazing and the tacos were so fresh .	643
1	we had a coupon for a free tea , so on our last night we decided to use it . they were nice and friendly . we went with the hot green tea and it was a great ending to a long day . i wish we would 've tried this sooner as i probably would 've started my mornings off with one each day . service was quick , the tea was good and next time i 'm in town , i 'll stop by and try a coffee product to see what that 's like .	2397
0	this is their chef salad for $ 8 ? ? ? ? it 's ice berg lettuce , mozzarella cheese , 4 quarters of tomato , and three slices of onion ... .what ? ? ? ? so disappointed ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1307
1	i 'm a young senior and love living here . my neighbors are great ! we say hello and ask how we are . we go to movies together . have cookouts . we like each other ! the office just needs to catch up ! !	1107
0	friendly staff and nice selection of vegetarian options . food is just okay , not great . makes me wonder why everyone likes food fight so much .	975
0	reserved a premium car for $ 62 per day rate . when i arrived , they did not have a premium car but offered me a dirty dodge charger ( `` standard '' ) which had less than 1/8 of a tank of gas - for $ 59 per day . what a joke !	3024
1	i stopped in to get my oil changed -- pretty routine stuff . the manager ( cory , i think is his name ) talked to me about my oil life and how it 's still doing just fine . said he did n't want to sell me something i did n't need just yet and to come back in a couple months . he topped off the oil and checked everything else , all without asking for a cent . that kind of honesty is rare in a business , and it did n't go unnoticed . i will definitely be going to this location from now on !	3819
0	i made my first appointment online and arrived 15 minutes early , where they confirmed my appointment at check in . i waited thirty minutes past my appointment time and still was not seen . the front desk informed that they had paged the person who was supposed to see me but that was all they could do . they did not offer to go back and check on the situation or do anything other than apologize . i am very disappointed that no efforts were made to accommodate me and will not be returning .	2457
0	do n't get the ice blended drinks they taste like pure powder ! such a big waste of money .	3238
0	this guy scheduled my appointment wrong then showed up 3 hours late and walked up my driveway like `` what 's up dude ? '' like he was a buddy of mine . he did n't even introduce himself until i had to ask who he was . personal vehicle and clothes that i would wear to the beach . lol . then the carpets took 2 full days to dry after i was told 3 hours max . he was unprofessional and i wo n't use again . i tried because he was local ... that was a mistake .	2135
0	considering the small portion sizes and above average price , i 'd lean more towards this place being overpriced . otherwise , i 'm pretty indifferent about fuku burger . i wish they had a veggie burger on their menu , but meh .	964
0	i ordered a cake for my daughter 's 9th birthday we ask for a pink cake and when i went to pick it up it was orange and the girl told me that i signed a contract and they not going to change my daughter 's birthday decoration they were all pink and her dress was pink and the cake was orange do n't ever order anything from these people	1806
1	my 2 roommates and i live in the university commons in oakland . some of the best apartments for pitt students to live in off campus , plus the service is excellent . whenever anything has broken or needed to be repaired , the online maintenance request was responded to within 24 hours and the maintenance guy frank is super friendly and gets any job compiled quickly . with the winter now upon us our sidewalk and back walkways are always among the first in oakland to get shoveled and slated by a crew walnut capital hires . the property management is also easy to work with and the online portal makes paying rent a breeze .	3734
0	i am in the market for a home , so i attended an open house that she was hosting . when i asked her a few basic questions about the house , she was dismissive and unhelpful . i really liked the house , and would have made an offer but for her unprofessional attitude . i feel pity for the homeowner who hired her .	3926
0	at this point , i 'd have to give them zero stars . after a couple of attempts , i could n't even get them to call me back to schedule an estimate for a house a mile from their showroom . i guess they do n't want my money .	1293
0	this place is new ... i love the grind and yet this place ca n't get it right yet ! i am going to give it a month and hope they work out the menu and educate their staff a little more with the things on the menu ! i wish them the best !	254
0	another follow up . .the pump motor went bad again ! ! ! and as noted the warranty has expired ( 90 days ) i then checked the model number of the pump and it was made june 2002 . i realize it was to be refurbished . .but to what standard ? ? ? i would think that this pump has seen its end of life	3266
0	prices were decent but the quality of the food were mediocre . i 've had better ramen dishes in az sorry . i wanted to give this place a try because of the reviews i saw and i wanted to support the smaller shops . i will give ramen sora a try next time i am in town to give a comparison review . stay tuned !	930
0	we ordered a chai blend creme and white chocolate ice blend mocha . the chai tasted like the water left over from a starbucks iced coffee . it was tasteless . the barista looked completely unprofessional . they were nice , but the ice blended drinks were not very great .	3753
0	prices kept changing and going up every time i spoke to them . still had the work done and received a $ 400 bill because they charged a different amount than what we spoke about . ca n't get anyone to listen to me . they keep explaining the insurance over and over and over but do n't listen . i try very hard to get prices up front so i can be prepared to pay my part but i feel that they lie about the prices . i will never go back !	3903
0	it 's usually great food just lately it 's been inconsistent had lunch just the other day and it was subpar , the chicken in the sweet and sour chicken was chewy and way over cooked , the vegetables in my other dish seemed old and not at all fresh .	474
1	great concept . food is good-fun menu and terrific custard desserts . drive-in service as well as indoor/outdoor seating . firepit for cooler nights . plan on visiting many more times . onion rings are fantastic , hot dogs are good , chicken sandwiches are great !	953
0	dr poremba and staff are very pleasant and friendly . my dental cleaning experience was great , and so was the filling repair . however , the first time i came in i waited about 45 minutes for an x-ray , an hour between my x-ray and dental exam . i am a very patient and forgiving person . there may have been too many clients to be seen at one time , maybe they were short staffed , or maybe i was forgotten . hopefully it does n't happen again .	1082
0	not terrible , just not great . marinara sauce is a little too sweet for my taste . maybe it will be better as leftovers ?	567
0	this walmart is always low on crap ! they need to stock better . lately iv been going to fort apache one .	2443
1	the best service for a theater . the manager is very friendly they try hard to help community .	611
0	only one thing to say about thunder from down under show- boring ! ! ! ! the dancers appeared tired and like they were just going through the motions.. marcus , the host , was the only dancer who 's routine was worth watching , and his time was for about 2-3minutes , prepare to be bored until his performance . go see chippendales at the rio instead , for girl 's night out their show is much better !	2149
0	over an hour wait for two sushi rolls and one stir-fry dish . waitress claimed the kitchen was backed up but that was clearly not the case as at least two other tables came in after us , ate , paid , and left before our food arrived . there was also no sense of urgency from any members of the staff that i could see . an in-experienced server is something that happens , but the fact that management did n't notice or care that a two-top sat for 70 minutes without food or drink refills is unacceptable . the food when it arrived was extremely underwhelming considering the wait .	626
0	in a nutshell , the food was good ( even with a limited menu ) , however this establishment is in need of proper management . when we expressed our concern regarding how we were being rushed through dinner on a saturday night -- the staff was ready for their long weekend off -- the manager seemed unconcerned , and quite unprofessional . bad customer service trumps good food every time . i wo n't be returning .	563
0	planned to eat here with a 9:15pm reservation for two on a thursday night because i had heard good things . they called me at 7:40 basically letting me know the restaurant closed at 10 . i felt that was in such poor taste , i just cancelled . they should n't take late reservations if they have to call with an annoying warning about their closing time . enjoyed another restaurant instead .	886
0	i remember being completely underwhelmed by this place . you 're taking two cuisines that should be tasty , and what i ended up with in my plate lacked any flavor . the tacos were bland and overpriced , the jerk chicken was spicy without any flavor , and the side of mango it came with was a joke , as it was tiny and looked like the garnish of a cocktail . the coconut rice was even bland . service was also bad . not returning .	1358
0	this place is mediocre at best . the guy making my smoothie was grabbing everything with his bare hands , i asked for two different smoothies and they were out of main ingredients . how does a smoothie place run out of bananas and blueberries ? service was slow and not knowledgeable and the prices are outrageous for the gritty , sub par smoothie . unfortunately i was looking forward to finding a good smoothie joint downtown , i 'll have to keep looking .	3223
1	az tex hats is amazing ! ! ! ! highly recommended . they have a huge selection of hats ! they also have very friendly and knowledgeable staff . if you need a great hat , definitely check this place out .	1181
0	unless you 're broke down on bonanza where they 're located do not use them waited three hours	2010
1	in from out of town , i picked up strep throat and caught an uber here to see a doctor on christmas morning . they were so polite and efficient . listened to me and didnt condescend . i was out of there in 40 min . i didnt have insurance and it cost me $ 100 . very professional and compassionate . they saved our trip !	2517
0	owner is forgetful about important repairs to clothing , items hemmed came back with more rips , open thread tears than brought in . service is inconsistent and timing takes too long !	3015
0	do n't do it ! way to expensive for the kind of food served . fish taco 's served with fried fish ! yikes ! my son had the `` live '' queso and chips . he thought this would be fun to see them made at the table . all the server did was dump the cheese , etc . in the bowl and stir ! not much of a show for 8.00 ! bad nachos . however the chips and salsa at the table were good .	1558
0	this place is brutal . little kids running around everywhere . supervised ? yea , 21st century supervision ... basically none . $ 17 to walk around a bunch of kiddie activities and learn nothing . we spent an hour there and we stretched it out . if you absolutely have to go , get a culture pass from the library and get in free because it is n't even worth the $ 1 we paid for parking .	3891
0	just got done getting a massage here so i ask before for a full body massage for $ 38 they say yes then all they did was put a blanket on top of whole body front and back and put pressure all over then had to put clothes back on to go outside in a different room to have a foot massage then that was it ... ... its sad that theyre not honest about what they mean by full body massage and on top of that they were charging extra $ 10 for an oil and hot stone : .. so felt like a got screwed for my $ 38 eventhough i ask upfront so just beware	2399
0	well . sat in the waiting room for 1 hour to have 1 tire replaced . truck sat in the parking lot the entire time . 4 bays open . completely understaffed . i saw them turn away an oil change with 1.5 hours till close . after waiting i asked for the tire with no install . i grabbed the tire . hurried over to discount tire and had them install it .	2146
0	update to my previous review ! unbelievable ! totally unhelpful . inconsiderate . waited over 24 hours for answers on a script that they ca n't even fill . could have called me . never going there again . no notes in system . pharmacist says oh i think i overheard someone speaking of this ? really !	1039
1	if you love plants of variety instead of the usual stuff you see everywhere else , then star is the place to go . if you love potted plants and unusual ones check out their selection.. .and do n't miss their half off pots sales either . the star on w. ann rd has a rock yard where you can get dirt or rocks by the pick-up or even in buckets..no need to pay delivery fees if you are a do it yourselfer..	99
0	this place is too bad ! my husband ordered spicy shrimp and they knew to chlorine , `` if something is clear the food is clean ''	7
0	i was seriously underwhelmed at the westin harbour castle . checkin might have taken 15 mintutes ... i just stood there as he hammered away at the keyboard ... is he twittering about my arrival ? ? did i catch him in the middle of a mavis beacon lesson ? ? is he going to print me a key or tell me to sleep in my car ? ? the room was dull . the following day i asked the concierge about local seafood - she sent me on a 6 block walk through the rain to a restaurant that is closed . thanks for knowing the area , sweetheart ! the king edward gets my next visit .	1859
0	this company says it all . advanced , they are really gon na take advantage of you ... . i think a better name for this company when they change their name because of bad ratings `` ripped off home services '' i rate this company i wish there is lower than 1 star ... maybe negative-5 star ! ! !	2416
0	work with a client at this location and she said the complex is pet friendly . well , i have seen the signs in the grassy play areas go from a pet free zone to no pets allowed ! where do you think a dog likes to do their business ? ? in the parking lot , in front of the entrance of each building , along the pool area ? had people interested , but once i showed pics of the signs , they said no way . either pets are allowed , or they are not . change your signs ! !	3475
1	my family 's go to dim sum restaurant . it gets quite busy on the weekends so expect a wait . they have cart service until 1 pm , but you can also order dim sum through the servers . food is always consistent and good . still ca n't find another dim sum restaurant that the whole family enjoys .	0
0	stay clear of this apartment complex . the staff that works there is the rudest most of professional people ... read your contract carefully they would try to steal any penny that they can ...	2033
1	this is one of the best places to eat . vegan can be great , and luna 's knows how to make such great selections with local and regionally farmed foods . i can not recommend it any higher . it is the best . the staff is amazingly friendly and on top of their service game . julianna is awesome , what a great culture and atmosphere .	1127
0	two weeks ago i telephoned from nashville and spoke to the scuba manager to confirm that as an instructor that i could rent gear to certify my daughter during my stay in las vegas . i went to the store this morning and was told that since i was not an instructor affiliated with their store i could not rent gear for a student ! needless to say i was quite upset ! ridiculous ! as an instructor i can rent gear for students at any dive shop ! i drove 3 miles and rented all the gear i needed and much cheaper than sports chalet was renting it for ! i will never buy anything from sports chalet again ! or rent ! !	3760
0	très jolie place dans la little italy . malheureusement pas plus de point positif . accueil pas remarquable , bcp d'attente . a l'arrivée des plats , on note immédiatement la petitesse des portions ( 3 boulettes vraiment pas bien epaisses ) et un gout peu prononcé . doute : viande congelée ? aucun problème avec ca , mais il faut veiller à bien égoutter l'eau , ça se voit et ça se ressent : -/ a noter , quelques bons accompagnements . bref le tout inégal et assez dispendieux .	815
0	uber is a rip off ! ! , they invent the prices and impose it on you ... i called for uber this morning and when the car came i asked if the fare was at 11/2 or other rate and he was n't sure ... i then cancelled the request as to start again as i wanted to see surging fees and it showed 2.1 ! ! ! ! , and i stepped out of the car ... i received a 5 $ bill for that ! ! ! , never again	2549
0	the owner has reached out and said he has addressed the video issue to ensure family friendly videos are playing . i have n't been back to confirm this but i plan to visit again . i do appreciate the owner reaching out .	522
0	in the past i would have given them 4 stars , but now it is only 1 . it seems there is either new management or ownership . the customer service is not good . two times in a row , they forgot to make one of my pizzas . the menu has changed and i just do n't care for the attitude i get when there . i wo n't be going back .	218
0	we wo n't ever be back . we had to wait 10mins for coffee , the food was mediocre and cold , and the place was dirty . we sat at the table outside the kitchen , and saw the cooks place plates of cooked food under the fryer while they waited for food staff to pick them up ; no hot plates or anywhere clean . their `` a '' rating is a sham if this is a normal business practice .	580
0	i have received a lovely arrangement from this florist a few years ago . however , when i ordered a funeral arrangement from them , i was extremely disappointed with what they delivered . the flowers they sent looked like they were dying . i simply requested soft blues and yellows , with no carnations , no other limitations . they sent a weak bunch of grey looking hydrangeas . unacceptable for $ 75 + $ 16 for delivery .	497
0	worst cut and style , i had a young male senior stylist . i believe this name was justin i asked for a simple trim and front layers ... instead i got about a 3-4 inch cut with layers around my whole head . i wanted a blow-out with a blow dryer ( i am trying to stay away from heat as much as possible ) .. instead i got a hot flat iron , making my hair pin straight with no movement my cut looks ridiculous only thing that was great was shampoo/head massage- thats about it save your money & time . go elsewhere	3610
0	no real atmosphere at all . bar was constructed like a kitchen counter . great tv 's . i-hop style menu . staff was busy talking to each other most of the time i was there . i give the place another 6 months top to survive .	428
1	bon , ma critique est pour le supermarché adonis . un mot pour le décrire : incroyable ! c'est énorme , très propre , des belles grandes rangées . beaucoup de choix : bar à olives et noix , bar à fromages , charcuterie , viandes fraîches , poissonnerie , un comptoir à emporter , un coin sushis , une pâtisserie européenne et une pâtisserie arabe . il y a vraiment de tout , pour tous les goûts et ce n'est pas cher ! ! ! en plus , un grand stationnement et on peut sortir les paniers ( in your face , pa dufort ! ) vraiment , ça vaut le déplacement !	1170
0	horrible customer service ! i was basically ignored for 10 minutes while i looked around , it 's a small store , by some simpleton , butterfly knife spinning , white trash dipshit behind the counter until i asked to look at some benchmade knives . he never asked me any questions as to how i was doing , if he could help with a knife purchase , anything ! i will never go back to this store and will suggest that no one i know does . they actually had the knife i wanted but because the customer service was so horrible i 'll be ordering off of the internet instead .	2927
0	worst shop i have been too in a while . i used to come here all the time when joe ran this shop and ever since he sold it , it 's gone downhill . the guys that work there are the complete worst . do n't waste your time here .	2047
0	called to ask about a price on a bike . they told me the msrp which i already knew . so i asked for the total price after taxes and fees . he said he would need to calculate it and call me later . i said i did n't mind being on hold while he calculated . waited over 15 minutes on the line before i decided to hang up . definitely not a good look for them .	3078
1	i had a great experience with maria . she did an amazing job on my permanent makeup . my eyebrows are beautiful and i ca n't stop looking at them . she gave them the perfect shape and my eyes have never looked so open . i love putting on eye makeup now ! ! !	2953
0	if i could give less than one star i would . i have been in vegas for 10 years . worst customer service and club i 've ever seen	1779
0	good music . decent food . overpriced drinks horrible service . i went to have dinner , and they charged me a cover at the door ? ! so confusing .	190
0	pastry case is fine , coffee is fine , the rest of the menu is fake french weak sauce . ok for to go pastries , not worth trying to eat mediocre food in an overly crowded environment .	1276
1	staff went above and beyond very friendly and they do a awesome job , got lashes done and i was so happy with the job they did would recommend this place	3614
0	really rude staff , asked for blankets and did n't get any . locked the pool really early . the staff smoked all over the hotel and reeked of it . unhelpful staff , and the rooms were n't stocked nearly enough towels . i 'm really unimpressed and wo n't be back .	1335
1	we have been using charter internet for almost a year . aside from a glitch or 2 with installation , the service has been steady and good . when i was having difficulty with connecting a couple of months ago , i was really annoyed . my troubleshooting pointed to the router as the problem - i did n't want to , but i bought a new router . everything has been fine since .	3575
0	my husband and i stayed here recently . the room was nice , but you could hear everything in the room next door because the walls are so thin . it 's close to the airport , so you could also hear the planes . just too noisy . breakfast was overpriced ! the worst thing about this hotel is that the maid stole my watch and cross necklace . the hotel clerk would not let us speak to a manger , so we had to file a report with the police . i 'll probably never see those cherished items again , and we will never stay here !	1348
1	robin is amazing ! he has phenomenal coloring skills ! i can not recommend him enough ! i had never had my hair colored before so i was a little hesitant but robin really listened and completely surpassed my expectations . i will definitely be back !	2340
0	i would give a zero if an option . made appt with marshall at 10am he was too busy to introduce himself or have the car i told him i wanted to look at on his lot . i was hannded off to another person and now purchased from bell road honda . horrible waste of time and disrepectful ! ! go elsewhere	2210
0	the management sucks i think his name was dan worst service they were so slow would not recommend to a friend	2375
0	i went to try taco chiwas i was expecting more for their food base on reviews the tortilla is good but the meats had no flavor dry and it seems like the meats are been re heated over and over not good at all desert are comercial nothing made in house to me this place gas nothing special exempt that is new ,	270
1	you will see pieces here that you may never have a chance to see again . it is connected to the museum of natural history ( recommended ) . however , this is not a hands on playground for young children . if your kids are wanting to run , climb , touch , them maybe bypass this . but if they are old enough to show respect & restraint then def give this a try .	101
0	the wash i received did not take off the bird remains on my sun roof , and the interior had areas of attention that i had specifically i asked to be addressed , but were nonetheless neglected . the saving grace was the friendly cashier . do n't waste your money here . pay the neighborhood kid , or your own .	3250
1	sylvia is an amazing stylist- a gem ! she builds great relationships with clients and listens to exactly what you want - and makes it happen ! i have been going to her for over 2 years and have been amazed with each visit ! request her next visit , you wo n't be disappointed !	2274
0	we contact thunderbird pools to have someone come out to give us an estimate on redoing our pool . we were told that our pool was not big enough of a project for them to do . they are only doing big projects . how can you say that our pool area is not a big project when you have n't seen our pool or our space around the pool . we are done with these people . they are just money greedy .	2530
1	got some help finding some adult piano books and a violin string for my wife . will return .	3886
0	got grease and dirt all over my interior . when i told them about it , the owner would not even look at the mess . i was told to leave and not to come back . and they did n't even fix the issue i brought it in for . do n't trust this shop to work on your vehicles .	944
1	cutest little coffee shop .. a little pricey but i love coffee so it was worth it . had the homemade salted caramel ice-cream as well and although it was quite expensive ( $ 12 for a pint ) it was delicious ! !	3749
0	overpriced , not many choices . the only thing good here is hummus . not worth the $ 20 i spent on lunch .	1419
0	najib moved to 4410 w union hills . stop by or call him at 602-481-8460 . he just worked wonders on my haircut !	14
0	i love einstein 's brothers bagels and when they changed this location to a caribou i was excited that they were keeping the einstein 's menu . however , the customer service here is nowhere near as good as when it was an einstein 's . customers are not allowed to get their own coffee refills , and if you buy a $ 4 latte they charge you a full coffee price to get a drip refill , even when you are reusing your original cup . some of the younger employees are quite nice and helpful , but overall the service is more in support of the corporation than the customers .	3571
1	i love charlies . great staff , good prices , fun bar , great entertainment , and clean . layout is a tad rough and there is no patio , also there are tv 's that do n't have anything on them other than adds for the bar . if there was actual tv on the tv 's i may never leave the place . there 's always fun to be had at charlies !	3661
1	a friend told me about this place . they have tons of candy , themed supplies , piñatas , balloons in all shapes and sizes . i almost got lost here looking at all the party stuff they sell . i really think that this store is super neat for parents who are too busy to make preparations for a birthday party . they also have a large selection for graduation celebrations and adult parties .	1882
1	this is where we go when our doggy needs some ice cream too ! they have dogsters peanut butter ice cream as well as some other frozen dog treats , and our pooch enjoys one on a hot summer day . the staff is usually friendly and helpful and will offer you samples as you talk through deciding what you want . i 've never had a flavor i did n't like ! plus it 's a great place for photo opps with the cute swings inside and the pink doghouse outside !	703
1	had the soup and sandwich . wow , it was great . i ca n't wait to return .	59
0	horrible service . cheesy outfits . my husband was carrying 5 tuxs to return and the rep went through the door ahead fo him , did not hold the door , did not take the heavy suits out of his hands and stood checking each tux in while my husband held the rest . then the guy was indignant that y husband was not more greatful . really ? gross .	1972
0	i went there for light up night with my kids and while eating dinner there was a mouse running on the side boards of the restaurant . i was so distraught we had to leave right away . please do not ever eat here .	1171
1	excellent customer service here ! i 've used the pharmacy ( drive through at night ) and store during the day and both were excellent experiences . by accident i left an item behind in the store after a purchase and the employees , especially the manager and assistant managers , were all very helpful in keeping it safe for me until i was able to retrieve it .	1881
1	stopping on a friday night and we were seated right away . the crabcakes were great . would go again .	951
0	getting a person on the phone is almost impossible at sw kidney institute . i am trying to pay my bills and ca n't seem to get anyone . i ended up leaving a message for call back . seki should install an on- line payment system like some.of the other medical organizations .	2845
1	i like dr.karen and all assistant very nice staff .they are all nice and friendly but everywhere we have anyway i think it 's normal .it 's matter how she take care you . i like dr. karen last time i had a cyst she gave me a medication for took a month then following one month it gone .she know what she does also my sister and my cousin they are all have baby .dr.karen take good care for them . good experience and wonderful take care .	661
1	fun spot where the locals go . reasonable prices away from the bourgeois tourists . it 's off the strip and a quick ride in a taxi or car share	3661
1	ulta and their buy 1 get 1 50 % off gets me ! well organized from brands , skin care , hair care , perfumes/colognes , etc . love love love . it 's good that it 's a one stop shop for drugstore brands and/or higher end brands . the ladies are helpful . also is a even more convienent location being theres a couple shoe stores and clothing stores including target , nordstrom rack . so you can go shopping and check out beauty supplies in the same area !	2479
1	i went to barbie 's with family , and despite a nondescript appearance we had some great food . my smoked meat platter was a tremendous value . the smoked meat was as good as i can remember since schwartz 's , tender and moist and very tasty . the french fries were classic quebec fries - very , very good . the before 4pm price was a bargain for such a large portion . service was fine , and there 's plenty of free parking . barbie 's is a hidden jewel . highly recommended .	77
1	working with tracy ford and steven nguyen have been a great experience . we 've purchased two vehicles within the last six months and have had great service . they got us in and out quickly . great customer service . we use the service department for all our vehicles and have had good service so far .	2210
0	rip off ! ! ! ! ! ! they said that there was no chance to get a room , six months out , for march . 300+ for a night ? why ? way to treat people .	1656
1	for all you hawaii people this place is like palama supermarket back home . it 's your one stop shop for all your asian , specifically korean food and accessory items . the prices here are very competitive and the bonus is no tax . this store provides fresh fruit and veggies , meats and all your other supermarket needs . they have several areas dedicated to ramen and rice . it 's like a shrine to these two items lol ! ! ! if your in korea town , stop by and take look .	715
0	where to start ... the place is not so bad to find though it was a little tricky . the staff was friendly and had a nice atmosphere . though my reason for the 2 stars is when me and my friend played the casino room , it was not the greatest of experience . it was very tacky so to say and the music and lights gave me a headache . the difficulty is right on par as they warned us but there were no leads on where to start and each puzzle had no flow between them it was a solve this then solve that kind of thing overall i loved the staff but my experience in the room was n't the best .	3088
1	good food in a nice atmosphere with friendly service . the guinness cheese dip is out of this world . i stop in every time i 'm in medina . highly recommend .	454
0	we ordered from here a few days ago . we had the vindaloo , biryani , samosas , mixed vegetables , and onion kulcha . the food was extremely salty ... including the mango salad . it would be great if they would let the real flavors of the food shine through , instead of masking them with so much sodium . we threw the majority of it away ... very disappointing .	640
0	i have loved this place prior to trying to exchange a tarp that had torn after the first use . cashier had said grab another one and we will exchange . after taking the tarp up to the counter i was told that the tarp was n't a manufacturer default , it was the user 's fault . i had had my other tarp for over 8 years and this one could n't last one trip . now i know the exchange policy , or do i ? ?	2669
0	went to sonics for my daughters fund raising for her school and i was quickly reminded how much i dislike this place . i think this may be the worst fast food burger joint for me . i 'd rather eat crappy burger from mcds .	994
1	this location is great ! ! im well traveled in the ross circle , and they are definitely not all created equal ! ! employees here are very friendly and courteous. ! ! not to mention the great deals ! !	695
1	paramount properties did an excellent job when i was a tenant . i originally was going to leave after my year lease was up but i decided to stay for two more years . now im buying a home of my own . paramount always helped me with any maintenance requests that was needed , and their team took care of any issues very fast and in a prompt manner.i have recommended them and will continue to do so in the future .	711
0	terrible company ! do n't buy anything from them . my son wanted sweatpants and a hoodie for his graduation in 2016 so i paid in advance for them . what he received was a sweatshirt and sweatpants that had one leg 8 '' shorter than the other . they have three numbers posted on their website to contact them . none of which anyone ever answers their phone . i left several emails for them with no response . i wasted over $ 65.00 for junk products . do n't waste your money with this company !	3848
0	terrible ... went in for a pedicure and fill . sat in the massage chair for 45 minutes before anyone started the pedicure . after waiting so long , they then rushed through my fill resulting in lots of air bubbles , and the polish chipping in literally 3 days . i understand if a salon is busy but instead of making me wait and then doing a poor job , please send me away and do n't waste my time or money .	3117
0	dont ever go here for piericings . 1 . ) they used the wrong clamp for my piercing . they used the wrong clamp . cough cough i mean she . i had to get it surgically removed a few days later . pretty cool spinal piece tattoo though but i got that one when it was still angry moon by tex mike : )	2989
0	they only serve poor tasting fried food and the service is so bad . the bartender was rude and ignored me . i simply needed food to go but he was too busy talking to his buddy and reading the paper .	1295
1	great place for a child 's birthday party ! the hosts do all the work , from entertaining the kiddos as they straggle in to serving and clean up . had our 13 year old 's bday there a couple weeks ago . after cake and present , they did mini golf and laser tag -- -all had a nice time , parents got to relax , and they it was over ! would definitely do it again here !	1154
1	pretty awesome place . they do have a coat check in case anyone was wondering , because i could n't find any information about it anywhere . the atmosphere is great and they play really good songs . there 's an a & w right across the street so you can go there for a snack after . the people are great and the drinks are great . 10/10 would go again	1282
0	i used to love this place . idk what happened . if it is new ownership they have a lot to learn	981
1	never been here before and i can say i 'm very impressed with the customer service we received . the employee was very friendly and kept asking if we were ok after giving us the food . the food was also great . i like the fact the have tons of sauces to pick from as well . we 'll be returning happy customer	998
1	i 'll start off by saying wow is this place expensive , yes , i get it uptake of a place like this is very expensive too . which is why i 've only come on discounted days because it 's just not big enough or time consuming to pay almost 20 dollars . regardless the place is very nicely taken care of i just really wish it was bigger . the shark tank is my favorite and the tunnel underneath it is even cooler . the staff are very friendly and informative ! !	706
0	absolutely disgusting ! i have been in this business for 15+ years and have never seen such a pathetic example of team work . all 3 of you just sat there talking about how proud u where to not be white and making complete jokes of yourself . funny thing is the only person working in the whole damn place was an older white gentlemen named steve . steve you where amazing and deserve a better job and team then the crap i witnessed . i will never step foot in this shit whole again !	241
1	when a business tells you that their arrival time is approximate but also says that they will arrive some time before 10 am what does that even mean ? do n't those answers contradict each other ? i so badly want to cancel my order with mdi because their customer service and eta 's are slacking . the only reason i am not canceling my order is because they actually have a good product and i want my home to look top notch . when i find a new rock supply i will let you all know . update ... mdi called and apologized and got the rock to my house asap .	3824
1	great service ! our dog had jumped up our window when he saw a cat outside causing us to be unable to fully close the window . we were able to get an appointment quickly and brandon fixed it right up for us ! would definitely recommend !	934
0	this place is the worst ever , two months ago i dropped off 15 pieces of my designer clothes . and all of a sudden they lose my salvatore ferragamo polo shirt.they have me fill out a stupid claim form , and make me mail out the form myself.and they 're the ones that lost my shirt.i have n't heard anything yet since i mailed the form.i have been going here for 4 years and this is the treatment i get . this place will never and i mean never will see my money ever again.i hope they shut down immediately .	2415
0	what kind of company is it when you ca n't even get a price quote from them ? ? ? ? i have waited very patiently and still no quote sent to me . tic toc south hills movers ... .my next review will give dates and the readers can make up their own minds .	370
1	definitely worth trying ! it 's one size for $ 7 for any flavor and as many toppings as you 'd like . they have a rotating flavor of the week and they make and roll the ice cream right in front of you ! a very cool addition to lawrenceville and pittsburgh in general .	3813
1	very professional - same day visit was not a problem . it 's best to text and also call .	723
1	wonderfully authentic . by far my favorite sushi restaurant in the valley . i ate here @ 2-3 times a week until i got married and moved to cave creek and have not been here in over a year . i walk in and there 's daniel , behind the bar making up some magic for your taste buds . i can hardly wait .	198
1	i love this place ! not only is the staff always friendly and kind , but the food is always great . fast service , and awesome atmosphere .	1491
1	when my friends and i arrived we were met by two girls who said they would be taking care of our party last night . that was the last time we saw them . the service was no existent . we ordered food that never came and we had mistakes on our bills . we had to go get our own drinks . at on point we had to go find someone so we could get our checks . it was not a good night at all .	648
0	i was charged $ 4 a shirt at this place . how is it rated one dollar sign ! they did an average job charging premium prices . most places average $ 1.75 - $ 2.25 tops . why would this be considered one dollar sign is beyond me . nevertheless i will not be going to this overcharging establishment .	2082
1	the best or one of the best pizzerias around las vegas , enough said .	192
1	i had n't heard of them before but i found a groupon deal and it was close to home so i decided to give it a shot . not knowing anything about this company , i was pleasantly surprised by their efficiency , friendly staff and overall value . i also got an interior cleaning/detailing while i was there ... it was soo worth it . it was soooo clean - almost brand new . they even found loose change and my flashlight which i had lost a while back haha . i would definitely go back again !	2655
1	love mrs mary ann ! ! ! she fixed my fuzzy and damage hair . now my hair looks healthy and more manageable . she took her time to explain what kind of product i should use on my hair . my hair has change drastically . her prices are within my budget . i definitely found my new stylist in las vegas .	74
1	miss linda is a doll - such a good woman . they overcharged us and she noticed and came out like 3 times in the hot heat just to correct that for us - shes the best ! ! !	844
0	lied about costs until i was months in . was told numerous times , from numerous people who work at this location `` without insurance it would cost less '' . i went with it because it was n't that much more , until i show up ( 4 months into my shots ) to be told i owe them over $ 600 when on my previous visit i paid $ 291.43 . something very fishy is happening through this place .	1964
1	very happy with the service & also prices at vivid racing , i take my porsche 911 there for anything from simple oil changes ( which vivid does for less than half what anyother shop will do ) to performance or body mods . jeff aguilar is the man , even found me a new front bumper for my 911 & picked it up himself..these guys are great !	978
1	do n't be fooled in to thinking this is just some donut shop , they have awesome sandwiches , and breakfast . the price and 24hr service is/are stellar .	3137
1	$ 1.50 for a movie ticket ? yes , please . i do n't go to the movie theater anymore because of the insane price of tickets , but here is a nice affordable option for those of us who would like the theater experience without having to go hungry . yes , the floor is sticky . yes , the concession stands are the same price as the normal theater ( with the exception of the $ 1 hot dogs ! score ! ) yes , it 's an old theater . so what ? it 's a dollar !	611
1	i 'm a big fan of this place . the owner , mike is an honest , stand-up guy who does n't price gouge , talk down to me because i 'm a woman , or try to trick me into unnecessary repairs . been getting my car serviced here for years and definitely recommend it to all .	1086
1	great job taking care of our tree . jake was prompt and polite . because we were away he took pictures and texted them to us . we will definitely use his services again .	1409
1	this place is tons of fun ! great hang out for friends and families . can get a little pricey , especially when you have kids . i do n't get why you need to purchase a card to play especially when this place works just like a bowling ally and you do n't need one there . just feels like a money grab . i would still recommend this place to anyone looking for a night out .	1483
1	love this place . we go almost every weekend . food is great . prices are cheap and the servers are the best ... polite , friendly and attentive . the kind of place they learn your name and bring you your drinks before you 've ordered . i wouldnt recommend it if you are in a rush on the weekends . its a popular place with a small kitchen . try the burger if you are there for lunch .	406
0	do not waste your time or money with station square ! this place is old , boring , dull but with sky high parking rates . you can find cheaper evening & weekend parking downtown ! most shops are empty and the ones there are n't all that exciting . it 's a cheesy tourist trap . avoid it .	3152
1	i was never much of gym person that i thought i would take out a membership , but i 'm really liking this place . although i have been working out at this golds for almost a couple weeks . the equipment is good , there are a lot of programs , the staff has been exceptional and the facility is clean . i seem to always get time on device even at peak hours if any very little wait . i gave jason my business he 's been really straight up and always available if i had questions . thanks golds !	3446
1	overall a great place to come for some delicious mexican food . to start off , it was very easy to find and with the name margaritas , it was an easy choice . my boyfriend and i like to try different places for our date night . the people were extremely nice and attentive , but not overbearing . they allowed us to enjoy our food ( unlike some other restaurants ) . mango margarita was yummy ; the perfect combination of alcohol . i ordered the chimichuga with side of rice , beans and lettuce . delicious . i am from california and this definitely reminds me of home ! will definitely be back !	882
1	it 's my gym ! . simply put , the layout is better at this location , more cardio equipment , more machines , no mma training taking up valuable space . easy on and off the 215fwy .	3446
0	i was excited to take my kids here . extremely disappointing . you would think they would be stocked up for the weekend but they were out of everything . the red velvet was ok , too much icing and it was way too sweet . my kids got the chocolate chip cookie dough cupcake and it was awful ! never will be coming back .	2024
1	only thing i did n't like was having to wait more than 1 hour to be seen , however it was peak time so i understand it can be pretty busy . i give jenny in advisement 5+ stars she really helped figure out what else i needed in order to transfer she even when out of her way to look up some extra classes i could transfer to nau . kudos to jenny in advisement for doing a great job and making things a tad bit easier for me in my education advancements ! !	2787
1	nice and prompt service . the price was reasonable too . they washed my car , but the wash was done poorly . the service department is very good . the sales department is well thought out , prices are low and there 's no pressure to buy something you do n't want or need . a refreshing car shopping experience .	2851
0	i tried to eat here and get a slice of pizza for lunch . there was a special advertised in the window for 2 slices and a pop . unfortunately when i went in and ordered i was informed they do not serve slices when it 's cold out . disappointing . perhaps if you are n't serving slices , do n't advertise them in your window .	810
1	this is a quick easy way to keep your car clean . i would have given it a five star but my jeep ca n't go through the wash as it gets stuck . i bring all my other cars here though . i recommend the unlimited package . great value .	2939
0	never have i seen such unhappy employees ! i also work in retail and i would never treat my customers as an inconvenience to be in my store . sighing in front of customers because they brought a discount printed out from the store website is beyond terrible customer service .	1296
0	this is my review for food only . food is no bueno ! i came here during the day time at lunch hour . i was more interested in the youtube videos and filipino dramas playing in the background than the food i ordered . i 'm sure it 's meant to be more like a bar and lounge and loads of fun at nighttime . for food i would n't recommend dining here if you 're sober .	817
0	i saw tasha twice for botox ... and twice i was not happy with results . i barely saw a noticeable difference , even though i paid for the same amount of units i normally received with april , who left their employment . time to find a new place . **on a positive note : love the front desk help ! forgot her name , but she was always awesome and so friendly ! ! i 'll miss her !	3366
0	not happy with my experience here . i told two people what i wanted . i want the outline in red and the inside black . very small , basic , and simple . i went to the artist and he asked if i wanted my tattoo filled in . i said no . just the outline . he ends up doing the whole thing in black . ca n't really fix it . will not use or recommend this place ever ! highly disappointed !	289
1	my husband and i were in the area looking for bfast and decided to opt out on dennys and ihop , and it was for the better ! i order cinnabon fremch toast and hubby had biscuits and gravy with sausage patty . it was delicious and not at all salty which we love ! med-large portions and coffee came in a large enamel cup . service was very friendly as well , great job cooks ! ! we will be back for sure	1319
1	i like this theatre because it 's usually just me and the hubby ! it 's like we 've rented the whole place to ourselves . the only thing i do n't like is having to walk -- or run , if you 're me -- through the nasty smoky casino . however , the theatre itself is clean and comfy and quiet , especially if you can wait a couple of weeks to see the latest new release .	2000
1	good , consistent , friendly service , these are the top three adjectives that i can think of to describe cafe rio . while it is a chain , i prefer it to chipotle , as i know it happens to be slightly healthier , and the staff there are fun to talk to as you go through the line . i 'm a fan of the tostada and salads , and i like that they make their tortillas fresh right there in the store , and that you can watch them make everything . i 'm also slightly biased in that it 's affordable and near the unlv campus , which as a student makes it very convenient for me .	1365
1	this joann 's is huge ! i only had 30 minutes here before i had to go pick up my husband from school , and it was not nearly enough time . the fabric selection was amazing ! there is a joann 's by my house but it 's less than half the size of this one , i think i 'll be coming here more often .	3943
1	just finished eating here ! and could n't leave without writing a review . their service was wonderful and the food was even better . the choripollo was excellent big portions for under 8 bucks . great lunch specials ca n't wait to come back when we are in town .	189
0	the food is okay but it is very greasy . it is hard to place a phone order because the person on the phone never understands english . do n't order a side of hot mustard or extra packets of that pre-packaged hot mustard ... they never get that . i 'm grateful that they now take on-line orders when i 'm in desperate need of chinese food . it 's the only time i order here now , always a last resort .	1459
0	this company is horrible . i have a service contract with them and my car was totaled in december and they will not cancel my contract and my gap insurance will not pay until this contract is canceled . the dealership has contacted them multiple times and i have called and sent emails and i received no call back , no email back , and they have not canceled my contract . never get a contract from this company , you will be stuck with it for life , even when you no longer have the car .	3496
0	bad service and unhelpful . receptionist was on personal cell phone and seems like she did n't want to help . when i came in on monday i asked for my paperwork i felt that she did n't even want to help or look for it and just told me that they did n't have it . unwilling to help or call geico i called geico my self and they called me back saying that the paperwork was there i had to go back to get the paperwork that was already there on monday .	1926
1	great cafe . stopped by to hang out and catch up with a friend . what better way then with macaroons and french sodas . delightful selection and decent pricing . nice location . staff was kind short and quiet but i got everything i needed and wanted while there .	1160
0	mold found in forager project yogurt - cashew type purchased at whole foods on 1/15/2018 really disgusting ! https : //foragerproject.com/products/cashew-milk/	433
0	absolutely terrible . sad attempt at fine dining . forgot dishes , poor service , nearly inedible food . if you 're a vegetarian expect to watch your partner eat because they have n't figured out how to do 7 courses without meat . no part of this meal was enjoyable . expensive , i feel like i was robbed . avoid this place at all costs .	783
0	ordered a smash cake for my son a week prior to the date needed . went to pick it up and they never made it . they said the would quickly make it and it would be ready in 30 minutes . over an hour later we were able to pick up a cake . got home about 10 minutes before the party started . the taste was okay . definitely not the same as this bakery used to be . i 'll be on the lookout for a new bakery .	868
1	this is a great place to grab a good drink and watch any game . the atmosphere is sports bar with a touch of sophistication . staff is friendly and prompt . food is above average and worth going back for . my favorite unique item is the half pound corn dog . the batter they use is exceptionally good . this is currently my favorite sports bar on n scottsdale .	970
0	we used to stay here frequently . so much in fact , the valet knew my wife and i by first name . but one bs charge on the credit card changed all that . someone decided we were responsible for damage to a door in the room which cost us $ 900 . that pretty much ruled out any future use of platinum hotel for us ...	2973
1	i 've lived in the university area far too long to have never been here . this place is awesome ! all the food is super authentic and prepared in house . best arrabiata i 've ever had ! i will definitely be back !	768
1	clean and good price . the staff at the front desk is so nice and friendly . my boyfriend and i have to stay in the lobby for the whole afternoon waiting for the flight . the staff is so nice to talk to us , watch our luggages , and offer us the water and coffee . definitely will stay again if i go back to phoenix .	3162
1	this place has it all , from food and drinks to customer service . their sandwhiches come out peferctly toasted , and it really does n't matter which one you choose . i love the italian , hawaiian bbq , and earls club . they use top quality and fresh food . everytime i visit , i am greeted warmly . the music playing is always nice . the environment is simply amazing for a sub shop . my favorite sub shop ( and their soups and salads are fantastic ) . i will always suggest this place to anyone .	432
0	i had a take out order , they gave me the wrong order . i had to drive back to get the correct order . moreover , i ordered a pesto pizza and there was no pesto in it at all . when asked the server they said this is how pesto pizza is . i have not had such issues with any other sauce location , always get the correct order and a proper pesto pizza . - unsatisfied customer	1161
1	dr. carter and his staff are top notch . i 've had nothing but the best service here from my initial appointment , surgery , and post surgery rehab follow-ups . dr. carter is an excellent orthopedic surgeon . i found him to be professional yet funny and witty at the same time . i 've read other review about him and toca and can say that i did n't see one negative thing mentioned in those other reviews . dr. carter took the time to explain the procedure and the type of rehab follow-up that might be included depending on the severity of the injury and findings during surgery . first class all the way around and my knee feels great !	2755
0	worst walgreens in my 25years of being a customer . this walgreens is what prompted my entire family to switch to another pharmacy . i ca n't believe the level of incompetence in this store ! ! front of the store is okay service , but avoid the pharmacy at all costs .	2471
0	worst customer service i 've ever received in a hair salon ! i would 've given negative stars if that was possible . the receptionists do n't seem to understand the notion of politeness and basic manners . always at least 30 - 60 mins of waiting time ; but do n't ever think of being late yourself ... they will actually cancel your appointment - their time is worth money right ( who cares about the time that you waste waiting anyway ? ! ) i ca n't believe i put up with this for years especially since it 's not exactly a cheap place ... the hairdressers believe they 're superstars but believe me , you can get better anywhere else .	3901
1	love this place ! been going here for over 10 years and average about twice a month for take away ... . i 'm pretty basic but love the chicken fried rice ( all white meat - best in valley ) and wor wonton soup as well as the mongolian beef ... just a great neighborhood restaurant with excellent service and food	1264
0	tried many times to set up tattoo with cleen rock , never worked out . too busy to set up appointment . went into shop with family today to get a tee shirt , no one at counter . no when helped us after 10 minutes we gave up . done	3910
0	i am sure this vet is great for emergencies but will push for unnecessary treatments . they were very friendly at my first visit and fussed around the cat as if he was the 8th wonder of the world . my problem is that they told me the cat needed teeth extraction and promptly printed a $ 1200 bill . i got a second opinion . the vet - recommended by a friend- commented on how super healthy his teeth were . no dental work needed . i still agreed on a couple of tests , got out of there with a $ 400.00 plus bill and a `` complimentary '' ( ! ) nail cut .	2487
1	famous footwear has had many items stolen . that is why they watch their merchandise so closely . i do n't blame them . they are very nice and helpful . i shopped there recently and i am going again today . i love their berkinstocks . i have a foot problem , and the berkinstocks help me walk . so if you are unhappy tammie , try to understand their position . it is the only store i go to for shoes . they have a right to protect their merchandise . they are always very helpful to me . i always give them a smile .	3725
1	i have eaten here several times while in las vegas . the food is good and the menu large . the help is okay and service depends on which side of the bed they woke up on . i have had super nice to short and curt . nothing horrible but i 'm always at a quandary to let management know when service suffers . i usually always cut them a break and know that they can improve . it wo n't stop me eating there but consistency would be nice .	1520
1	the representative jaziel brown gave great customer service . display a great amount patience and explained everything . awesome experience ! will certainly go back .	2542
1	nice new place for pinoys to hang out in vegas .	817
0	how bad could this place be ? we waited 15 minutes in a booth a waitress never came to get a drink order say hi or anything else ! i walked up to two managers that were rolling silverware to tell them how it was and they said `` its a hard night tonight and give us a break '' they never said sorry or anything else avoid this place at all cost ! i called to talk to management and they do n't want to talk to you nor will they call you back , avoid all nugget 's at all costs !	3378
1	this is a very fun place . there is a wide range of age groups , and do n't worry there are plenty of people who have never played before . admission is $ 15 but an extra $ 5 if you do n't have there custom house bbs . they rent guns for $ 15 . one session is 4hrs long with breaks in between games . this is a great place for parties/group activities . would recommend to anyone !	3058
1	i loved my experience at 800 degrees ! i went there tuesday for lunch and i was recommended the carni . my pizza was made by yoselin and you can tell she takes great pride in her work ! the pizza was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing ! overall , great establishment , everything looked nice and fresh . 800 degrees will absolutely be my go to spot every time i am in vegas !	282
0	terrible customer service ! they never call you back . even when you have a warranty they give you the run around . avoid this company .	3738
0	ordered the shish kebab roll with no onions for takeout . wo n't return .	1088
1	i 'm shocked at the bad reviews - i recently went to designs in dentistry and had a wonderful experience . dr. alexis is a wonderful dentist and all of the staff with whom i interacted were very kind . i love the office - it is very neat and clean and they offer a host of natural/holistic dental care and do offer holistic dentistry treatments . i am excited that i found this practice and look forward to being in their care for years to come .	697
1	excellent food , great variety , yummy ! rose reisman 's bowls are deeelish ' ! ! !	534
0	there were a group of us on a tuesday night . the bouncer used the `` f bomb '' and we had to leave . the group consisted mostly of russians who were confused about the id process . this says a lot about america at this time . agressive . ridiculous . no thank you .	3840
0	une attente de 45 minutes et des œufs bénédictines pas assez cuits et un café qui goûtait l'eau .	628
1	this is my favorite bowling spot staff is cool . they have beer deals at night . the lanes are well maintained . great for company get togethers .	2235
1	i flew allegiant air from des moines to phoenix flight 153 on 5/22/2017 and the flight crew were fun and super friendly . best flight i 've had in a long time . thank you ! ! ! ! !	3127
0	very slow，so many people for waiting but banker only talk each other without help anyone，waste our times！very bad place！	2761
1	this is one of the few gyms i will frequent ! place is clean , friendly staff , place is usually pretty busy , but most , if not all , the equipment is available for use , even during peak gym hours . an interesting thing to mention is that this is a former 24 hour location that la acquired earlier this year , but also that la has done a fantastic job integrating this location under the la fitness banner . enjoy your workout !	1802
1	this is my favorite go to pizza in lorain . a lot of people in lorain rave about yala 's ( also very good ) , but for me , eliseo 's is where it 's at . the pizza is well done , yes , with crispy edges , but the main part of the pie and underneath is not over done and it is not burnt . just the outer crust is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside . and the cheese has that nice browned flavor . the sauce is tangy , not sweet , not spicy . just right . the pizza is consistent and delicious . you ca n't go wrong with a deluxe .	1000
1	this place is a must when i 'm in vegas . i came here with my friend on our last night in vegas . i got a bellini and she got an 190 octane with an extra shot . since i cant stand the taste and smell of alcohol , the bellini was perfect for me . a couple of hours after my friend had the octane , she was wasted . so beware about getting the 190 octane wih an extra shot .	2528
1	i honestly would give this place 5 stars , but only had a burger , which was silly ! they also provided a ghost pepper aioli which was solid and added the right amount of kick . these guys know what they are doing and have a great staff on hand . cool bar to grab a cocktail , with an awesome selection of bourbon . will be heading back for sure !	1226
1	what a pleasant surprise this store was ! it looks small and plain outside , but inside , it just keeps going and going and it 's packed full of great stuff . they have the biggest selection of keen shoes and smartwool socks that i 've seen in champaign-urbana .	2259
1	i 've always enjoyed this branch for my home repair needs . it 's quite close and never too busy . the staff have always been nice and helpful . one complaint i have is that the key maker/machine here seems a bit off . of the three times i 've come to make copies of keys , i had to go back again because the first copies would n't fit very well .	124
0	they only serve 2 side dishes for a single person . on rhe back of the menu it says 4 , in the past i was always served four . when i mentioned it to the server this lady just acted like she did n't even hear me	435
1	i was very surprised . i was in and out in 20 mins . 1 . i took as little into the building as possible ; wallet and paper work 2 . i brought everything i thought i needed so we would not waste time 3 . the person that helped me was fast , and to the point i got what i needed and left !	2780
1	have been using them for years , always better than dealing with mdv . have n't left reviews earlier do n't really want others there and make lines long , sorta selfish , but looking at other silly reviews made me leave this review , first you ca n't blame them for the state laws , they know there stuff great job ! !	2990
1	is it bad that i love this place ? when i was living in the soho a few years ago , it was my go to place for snacks and scratch cards . i will always remember it fondly and will visit it whenever i need something .	62
1	yelped it . found it . booked it through the web . driver showed up 15 minutes early but was cool with waiting . traffic was backed up but it still only cost us the flat rate of $ 47 ( plus tip ) from queens west to airport . all good . thanks yelp and tal .	2952
1	really good thin chewy delicious crust . excellent fresh ingredients . really fast , pizza is ready seconds after you pay and get a drink . plus , it 's really inexpensive . not inexpensive for the strip , inexpensive for anywhere .	282
1	i never visited the showroom - i bought my couch online , and i could not be more pleased . i absolutely love it . it is just as good , better even , than described , and was delivered the same day . there was an error on the website related to delivery costs , so i called their 800 number . the cs rep , cynthia holliday , was more than helpful , the error was in my favor and she honored it , and i am sitting here on my comfy new couch that i absolutely love . it was less than $ 300.00 , i 's made by ashley , who could ask for more ? love it !	2071
0	office is never open . we have been trying to talk about our lease to someone there because their website is broken and it wo n't let us pay rent ! ! also we ca n't get out packages every time they get delivered again ! because they are never there .	1610
0	i 'll keep it simple ! i hate my haircut ! i did n't realize how uneven my hair was until i got home .	3489
0	horrible customer service . the owner needs to smile and care for her customers . i will never ever go back again . what a shame ! ! !	2535
0	the last two weeks , the bloody marys were exceptional ... this week they decided to forego the good mix and compensate with water ? not sure , but aweful . took forever to get a drink and now no one has checked back for food or anything ... been easily 20 minutes . they also do n't understand their satellite system and keep changing the channels to the incorrect games ... thats annoying enough , then add the dumb patrons bitching about it . i 'll just go home and make bloodys ... if anyone knows of a good spot to watch football and have some good bloodus , put it on here . thanks !	1520
1	love love love this place ! sophisticated and classy . a nice and fun environment .	634
1	for the mother of a toddler , i probably still live that hipster toronto life a little too hard . every few weeks when it 's # momsnightout , and by that i mean i go out with my besties who do n't yet have fresh little nuggets ruling their lives , camp 4 tends to end up on the bar crawl list . it 's not offensive , the music is ok , there is usually seating and the bartenders are nice . for better or worse it 's exactly what you 'd expect along this stretch of dundas w and i 'm into it .	1837
0	just a quick update : they have no kosher food . i find that odd , because every other supermarket in the sw has a kosher section , even the walmart at arroyo crossing . i guess they do n't know that there are jews in southern highlands and mountains edge .	3066
1	the ladies here are always very friendly and helpful with all my projects . great selection of fabrics and crafts . also have tons of fabric patterns to chose from .	3876
0	had an appointment to get liquid gel nails done . the lady who did my nails was very rude and i did n't like how they turned out . i tired to communicate with her but was ignored . will not return , would not recommend .	2434
1	fresh and delicious . will return to try other dishes . the service was friendly but i felt bad for the woman managing the front of the house . she was swamped with take out orders . decor is diner meets barber shop , but the food more than made up for it .	594
1	7 pounds of boneless , skinless chicken for $ 7 . super cheap produce too . why pay more ?	3096
0	so so sad . quality has gone down since they started expanding . when i first started eating at sauce , it was great food . the last two times i 've gone in , the roasted veggie salad was pretty much raw . they used to cook and toss the brussel sprouts and cauliflower for the salad . service last time took forever to get pizza . seemed more concerned about getting to go orders out the door . used to be a go to when we wanted to eat out but not so much anymore . too bad .	1161
0	this is a very basic/mediocre ayce sushi . especially compared to all the other ones in mississauga . this is the first time i 've been in a longgggggg time and it 's still just `` ok '' . it satisfies my sushi craving just enough ! i just happened to be in the area and was craving sushi so thought i 'd give it another try ! i meaaaan i would still eat here if i had to ... .for get togethers or something but would prefer somewhere else . i came for lunch so it 's natural that options are more limited compared to dinner but still just ok .	1231
1	this place is excellent ! i called ahead and was able to get right in the next day . they speak english so it 's easy to communicate what you want . great pedicure chairs and she was able to do exactly the design i wanted ! would highly recommend : - )	415
1	lodi garage doors and more are awesome . i had a problem with a second lift master computer board out of warranty and they fix it pronto . even made the appointment on time as promised . bill , kenny and mario get the job done .	3931
1	lees has everything one would look for in a beer/liquor/wine place . good selection of wines and beers . prices seem normal .	2551
1	great resource . felt good about taking my d800 in for repair . was kept informed every step of the way . competent , courteous and reasonably priced . it 's my go to place now .	633
1	i 'm not going to complain . about 60 % or more cheaper than all the other airlines and straight flights to places i want to go to . do n't complain about non reclinable seats ... that is the reason they charge less . you get what you pay for . if you want more comfort and do not mind the hassle of connecting flights , then go suffer and pay more for it . it is a very simple concept and i would sooner suffer a little bit on the non reclinable seats but heck no more connecting flights . it 's going directly to my destination . no hassle !	3127
0	horrible experience , in may there is nothing to see ... nothing ! you pay 20 bucks to walk around and see a couple of chinese gazeboes , pounds and tree ... no exhibitions ... nothing ... the bars were closed ... it was pretty hard to find the fountains were to drink , even using the map . i felt like they stole my money ...	183
0	it 's definitely more authentic thai , but the pricing is way too high for food amounts . some of the dishes were a bit odd , and quite unpalatable , e.g. , one dish was ground meat with a giant hunk of uncut cabbage . the pad thai was ok , the steamed noodles were not , not chive cakes were super oily and too chewy , just raw rice paper with very little in them . the traditional chicken dish with oily rice was very old dry chicken that was just not edible	553
1	meilleur poisson frais a montréal dommage que le personnel cultive une attitude condescendante choix alternatifs : la sirène.plats préparés et boîtes/congelés à l'étage sans intérêt particulier	3046
0	very middle of the road kinda dinning experience ... ... ... ..	102
1	ive decided to give this place another try . received feedback from the owner and a complementary meal . i took my time coming back , beause i was so unhappy with the previous service and food . i must say , this time was awesome ! ! ! my server was kris , she was very attentive , polite and just great . the food wasnt like licking a salt lick like my last experience . it was mlk day , so you opended later in the day . there was a line , but it moved very fast and we were seated quickly . overall , it was a way better experience and i will be back . thank you !	1491
0	if i could give this place a negative star rating i would . this is the second time i have have been there since this miserable rude woman bought it , and the second time we were up charged . i was up charged 25.00 for brushing out knots and did not wash my dog claiming he was to knotted . i said we do n't care bathe him and they did not . the place is old looking and never clean . to many choices to deal with robbers and rude people . i still feel the gun in my back . stay away ! ! ! ! ! !	2324
0	never waited 10 minutes at the front of the line to be helped then for them to tell me it will be 10 minutes until they start making my sandwich . it 's like they want you to leave . strange .	724
1	it 's a nice clean environment with friendly staff . the wings are top notch , they are big and meaty ! the dip sauces that came with the wings were perfect to send my palate over the top with happiness .	1292
1	i 'm seriously obsessed with my nails ! the sns powder lasts for weeks and this color compliments anyone ! they do get busy so call ahead of time and see what the wait time is or make an appointment . thank you guys ! ! ! ‍	415
1	harry -- you 've done it again ! great service . this time we got a 12 passenger suv limo , which picked us up downtown . our driver ( sam ) was on time , and , called me 15minutes before pick up . very reliable . limo was nice . tons of room for our party of 7 . they were accomodating with 5 extra stops , and , i was welcomed back as a return customer . you can count on me returning again . thank-you !	2952
0	i have taken my car to this place 4 times have spent nearly $ 500 dollar and my vehicle still is n't fixed . the store manager has a horrible attitude and instead of rectifying the issue made it worse by talking crap . i would never recommend the . for vehicle repair	1993
0	hate to give back to back negative reviews but one of the bouncers there was egregious , preposterous , and asinine . open to giving them a second chance though	1176
1	i never realized there was a jl so close to me . my newly acquired company car was i dire need of some maintenance so i pulled up , sat in the lounge , waited for roughly 45min when i was told there were a few things overdue : radiator coolant was passed , oil change , engine air filter , compartment air filter and wiper blades . $ 200 bucks later i rolled out with a newly maintained vehicle . i also got 20 % off . : )	2852
1	love everything about this place , the atmosphere to the food . come on a weekend and they have love music , piano and singer usually . nothing bad to say about this place . excellent menu ! can tell its family run .	625
0	let 's just say the customer services is below par . if you 're a minute late the girls sit behind the counter and make you wait while they do whatever on the computer and or their cell phones . i feel like i 'm being punished every time i show up . groupon . go somewhere else . also i have n't seen any results and on 8th treatment .	343
1	a fast food korean restaurant with interesting pancakes and dumplings . this has a nice family restaurant feel that reminds me of my parent 's shop when i was a child . i could be going to too many korean resturants , because my baseline expectations are no longer reasonable , which is why i still give them 5 stars to help them out . kudos for making me a loyal customer with photos of your children .	435
1	i loved this show and thought it was exceptional : clearly high tech production stuff going on , cast is clearly having fun with it , songs are awesome , comedic bits and lines are funny ! young simba and nala are great performers . rafiki is crazy . mufasa is sooo eccentric . mufasa is mufasa like . but ... *****spoilers***** not too dramatic at some parts like mufasa 's death . other than that i recommend this show .	3022
0	this is the worst break masters in town . not one mechanic can show you there ase certifications even though they advertise it . i would never recommend you let these guys touch your car . they make jokes after they mess up your car even blew a customers engine while i was there . the wait is a joke like the employees as they all sit around watching videos on there phones while your car sits there . there 's is a reason kids work at these places . you want a mechanic go to a repair shop not a jiffy lube cause that 's all that break masters is . save your money please do n't make my mistake .	2552
1	this is my favorite place to go to . they are organic , delicious and the servers and staff are really nice . i always order the herb turkey wrap , with the jalapeño pesto sauce , which never fails to satisfy . they have grass fed beef tacos , and gluten free as well as vegan dishes . for those who are conscious about where the ingredients of their food comes from , this is a great place ! and delicious !	1402
0	bottom line store says they 're open monday through friday 10 to 6 i show up at 5:35 and they 're closed . nothing else needs to be said !	1236
0	over-priced with mediocre food . the rib steak was well done , charred on the outside , even though i asked for medium well and slightly pink inside . the food of my parents was also poor quality with excessive spices . the place relies on spices it seems , to mask the average quality of its beef ! service took about 45 minutes to get the main courses and even the appetizers took 15 minutes ( or more ) to arrive . for the ridiculous price of $ 41 for the rib steak , the cooking quality was a rip off ! will avoid this over-rated money trap in the future !	1363
1	read the reviews . if you notice the bad reviews were a year ago . i came anyway . i came in for an oil change but ened up getting a battery which i needed , 2 filters which i needed ... but it was n't pushed on me . they gave me the option to say no but i 'm a uber driver so i went ahead and got everything done ... i will be back again ...	2852
1	we love this restaurant because the food is home style mexican and the atmosphere is fun and what i expect with great mexican food . absolutely love the lady bartender on friday nights . her margaritas are second to none . there is usually a wait but it is truly worth it .	1346
0	was also surprised when i came in here and found there were n't many selections on flavors , and even the basic flavor like strawberry they did n't have . more specialty mixed flavors that did n't sound good . to my surprise yogurtland and u-swirl are actually way better . not very clean and trash was to the top .	738
0	be aware ! 2 months ago i purchased a package of 3 treatments . after using it only once , they marked my package as redeemed ! just like that they stole from me $ 120 . what a laim business plan	2320
1	my wife and i tried this place for the first time tonight . the food is fantastic and the service is really attentive . we will be returning to this place as often as possible .	202
1	i have to agree with the previous post , my first impression was the same . for the price you ca n't beat it . i had my 3 yr olds birthday party there , and all the kids had a blast . everything inside is very well worn , but honestly , who cares . it 's a great place to have a birthday party , the pizza was horrible in my opinion , not one person ate an entire slice . 3 pizzas for 13 people and i threw away over one pizza worth . i ca n't wait to take my son back , he had so much fun , lots of rommel to run around when not crowded .	3439
1	i really enjoyed the music here and had a really good time the more i had to drink . i met some really cool girls in the bathroom , and at one point there was almost a break out fight over the stall . when we had mentioned that there were no liners in the bathroom , there was a gentleman who promptly gathered his supplies and cleaned the restroom . it 's a cute little latin club with mostly older folk . i 'm 22 and i felt like i was probably the youngest person there other than two other females . older people def dominated .	849
1	pros : friendly staff ! quick service have both outdoor and indoor seating cons : they do not accept star reward purchase have to enter through casino would certainly go again when in the area	683
0	unlike what the website indicates , there is little visitor parking reserved during pitt games . so after waiting in traffic for an hour we were met with an 'event parking $ 45 ' sign . way to put profit over the experience for potential patrons .	1924
1	can not get enough of the vitamin sea bowl , anything with kimchi is good in my mind . ca n't wait to try their smoothies and the acai bowls . staff are really nice which just makes it that much more pleasant .	9
0	returned there again to give it another shot . inattentive wait staff and very slow service sort of highlighted this visit . the food was okay but to watch ticked off people sitting around waiting for their food and drinks did n't create much of an atmosphere . lunch crowd was very light and still the service was pretty slow .	1212
1	i could n't wait to try this place and i am soooooo glad that i finally got to ! i loved it . i swear i 'll never pay for sub ... uh i mean that other place again . the engineer was like amazeballs . the price was markedly higher but i 'm willing to pay for a great sub like this .	517
0	great food , but please do n't lock your doors at 7:40 when you advertise being open until 8pm . i made a special trip for jj 's only to be met with a locked door and no notice of the change or practice . disappointing . i 'll definitely think twice next time i want a hot dog .	58
0	i would have given this park 5 stars as i 've attended many wonderful events there in the past . but this weekend it seems they are actually allowing a bullfight to go on ( alliance of portuguese clubs ) and consider that 'entertainment ' . how absolutely horrible and disgusting . who thought that would be a good idea and actually approve it ! disappointed and outraged that such a thing would even be considered !	3715
1	love this place ! the owner is super nice and really cares about her clients ! people complain about the prices but you get what you pay for in cheap salons . the salon is very clean & they always use sterile tools ( the take them out of packages infront of you ) . the girls who do your nails are super nice and professional . if your manicure is n't done properly they have no problem fixing it for free . love this place , you get what you pay for	3605
1	could n't be happier with the knowledgeable professional service we received by our service technician billy cooper . exceeded our expectations . it 's no fun feeling vulnerable when you need service for and appliance you are not familiar with . to have someone like billy to put you at ease with his honesty and competency made for a great experience . hoping our 20 year old hvac system keeps purring along for years to come .	1803
1	i had to conduct some business at chase bank . we were greeted by the manager and the teller was efficient and friendly . i will make this my branch .	1457
0	we use to frequent this place very often because the food is great . however last time we were there we had to walk out because 20 minutes after ordering our food we noticed that ppl who just walked in got there food right away which was the exact same thing we ordered . i do n't knows why this was happening it was really frustrating . i really hope it was n't a race thing . i 'm sad to say we wo n't be back due to horrible service .	577
1	we went into armadillo grill for lunch and to watch football . i was very impressed with the atmosphere and food . we had drinks , appetizers , and entrees . everything was phenomenal . we loved the mozzarella bites . this is one of the few bars i have been to that also has horse racing . really good time !	717
1	hip hop and rnb is where my heart is . this is the place if you 'd like to party and have a great night out . the drinks were well made , enough space on the dance floor and vip service is impeccable . i highly recommend bottle service if you 're celebrating tonight . furthermore , i had the opportunity to meet the owner , he was extremely kind and made sure our night was flawless .	2200
0	worst experience ever . do yourself a favor and do not use western states flooring ( somehow they are the only company home depot uses ) . home depot will not schedule your install and western states flooring wo n't contact you until well after your order arrives . it 's taken well over a month and guess what my floors still are n't done . then home depot calls and says western states flooring wo n't be there today like they are supposed to and if i 'd like to reschedule i would need to contact them . well why did n't western states flooring just call me then ? ? ? so i call western states flooring and ... no answer ! ! !	1379
0	how a french restaurant runs out of crepes does not make sense to me . half of their menu is literally crepe and did n't have it available at 10am .	1276
0	do not go through this property management company ! they lie , they steal , and they do n't answer calls or emails regarding fixing anything in your rental property nor do they answer calls or emails regarding getting your deposit back ! they told me i would get my deposit back within 30 days and it 's been now past 30 days ! they are so unprofessional and they do n't deserve to have anyone 's business !	1465
1	honestly this gym has to be one of the cleanest gyms i never been to . the staff is always cleaning it 's great . they have a lot of machines so you never have to wait . only $ 20 a month for me and my husband and super friendly staff . i 've recommended blast to many people and will continue to do so .	2959
1	just came in , very pleasant , i think ( owner ) gave me a choice of saving 25 % off discount until later time when i mention `` yelp '' brought me here , tasted sauce apple bbq yummy hopping burger is just as good . reserved judgment for taste-5 star	940
0	bought 2 bottles of ejuice yesterday , strawstard and fresa de leche , both taste awful ! really taste like nothing , it seems like there is no flavoring only oil , unfortunately i got the big bottle ( 120ml ) ..big mistake : (	2839
1	the fist time i saw this place i took one look and was like no way . so i went inside and it blew me away . one of my favorite bars . bartenders are greeeeeaaattt . o n the people too .	2045
0	ordered delivery . was n't impressed . i had the cheddar and mushroom burger . did n't care for it at all . ended up eating the top bun and throwing the rest away . wife had the cajun pasta and said it was ok . probably will try somewhere else next time in madison	705
0	this is not the worst chinese buffet i 've ever been to . and that 's the best thing i can say about it .	135
1	we went there after the dinner rush around 10 and sat at the sushi bar . it was n't crowded at all . we ordered our sushi rolls and watch the sushi man make it right in front of us . the sushi was soooo good and sooo fresh . my gf said that it was her favorite sushi roll ever . and we 're sushi fanatics . the food and service were so good we went back the next night and ate even more sushi . great place to start your night off right in vegas .	1196
1	great scaled back version of the downtown champaign location . i love that the big rolls are $ 1 each and every day , i 'm jealous that this was not on campus when i was a student . despite not having all the glitz of the original , the service was excellent and staff is super friendly .	912
1	came in chevron for a fill up and a wash , i always get a hand wash to cut down on the scratches in my paint . i ordered the hand wash , paid for it but when i look up i see my car going through the machine . i promptly informed the cashier and she looked very surprised . she got the manager and after a couple of min of investigation the manager comes back and apologizes and offers a free hand wash on my next visit . i understand that people make mistakes but when you take care of the customer once a mistake has been made is what keeps me as a customer .	2681
0	this is by far the worst . i like how it still have the authenticity of rolling carts with food . but the food quality is not good and service is bad . i asked for service for 2 times in a row and because of that , i was given attitude cause i asked him to get water once and sauce the other time . because of the rolling carts food sometimes comes out cold .	0
0	car wash ? not at all . they just vacuum the inside of the car , they do n't detail anything . the worst detailing service i have ever received in my life . same issue my husband had with his car . we will never return to fabulous freddy 's ever again . do not waste your money . oh and got a few lovely scratches on my new mercedes benz thanks to `` fabulous '' freddy 's .	2198
1	we have our main credit card here b/c my dear fil served in the air force . i 'm grandfathered in for marrying his offspring - the benefit ends here , i think . so if you 've got any military in you one generation up or less , make sure you take advantage of usaa 's appreciation of service . they work with you on life insurance , auto loans , home loans , all things financial . cha cha cha .	1727
0	all the tomatoes on a turkey sub were rotten ... how to you put 4 rotten tomato slices on a sandwich and not notice ? too expensive for the quality of food ... and a la carte ? really ? ... come on ... you 're a glorified applebee 's .	898
1	i started coming here in january and though i did n't feel pressured to get the membership i did . i 've only seen ashley ( ash ) , she does a great light and medium pressure . she 's given me some great breathing tips and has helped me improve my flexibility . i ca n't say enough wonderful things about her . everyone i 've had contact with here has been great . i also got a facial here last month and was very pleased as well . i wish the massages were the full time though and like the other poster said not the '55 minute hands on ' . also , they have a point earning system which i just learned about .	2252
0	i really want to love this venue , however , the general admission/pit can make your experience there chaotic . i recently went to a show at the axis and had the worse time just to trying to reach the pit area . once the doors open , the ga guests push/run to get into a second line ... which then you wait ... and then once again you have to hopefully not get trampled as you make your way down to the actual area . security should let ga guests in 4 at a time so that guests do not have to panic about their safety .	2879
0	really wanted to like their cupcakes , but unfortunately they just were n't very good . the main issue is that they are soooo dry . yes , the icing is pretty good , but there 's way too much of it and the actual cake is so plain , so dry that you feel like you 're eating icing and bread .	2013
1	this is the best starbucks around and it is open late . the manager and staff are great . my only complaint is that they close down the clover machine before closing .	3641
1	awesome highway ! .. no traffic when i went to the airport . it is a toll road , but driving all the way . its a few dollars amonth and a few cents each time.. is what i was told.. well worth it !	2336
0	these places have bad customer service and will have turned me orange when i spray tanned . after they promise no orange guaranteed . then they will not refund your money and they have shady business going on with the workers . i guess sometimes they just keep the money and do n't log you in :	2582
1	these ladies were great ! professional , polite and made my first experience a good one . they were not pushy at all ... i truly respect that . i tried the new product gelous nail coat , it was a powder with zero smell or burning . so far it 's been over a week and they still look shiny and new !	2364
1	partell pharmacy 's staff are courteous and helpful . the pharmacy is clean and has two registers to check you out fast . the pharmacist are knowledgeable and ready to answer all your questions . the pharmacy also stocks many supplements . this pharmacy has two locations one on the east side one on the west side .	1372
1	love the little girl chairs ! very clean and the ladies are always pleasant . my nails look great .	3369
0	i went into this store for the first time today . i 've lived in wexford for years and have heard many mixed reviews . the store is over crowded and most items are over priced . there were two women working , and neither one said a word to me . one actually made eye contact , looked me up and down , and then walked away . needless to say , i wo n't be going back . the only good thing about this place is the cute little white dog running around . he is so friendly , much friendlier than the staff .	2709
0	horrible customer service . i walked around the store for a good 45 minutes and not one employee asked if i needed help with anything and when i get to the counter to check out the cashier asked if i found everything okay ... . really ? most of the women that work there act like they 're above/better than you . that 's not how a customer should feel . definitely not an inviting environment . next time i 'll make the drive to sephora .	2479
1	the food is always great minus the brown rice . we usually order to go and it 's fantastic . if you 're dining in though , the wait time for food is a little long .	408
0	the service is terrible . david , the guy in charge is rude and was not very helpful . my car has been here for almost a month , they have been telling me it 's gon na be ready for pick up for the last two weeks . every time i call david says he will have it ready at the end of the day , it 's been like this for literally 2 weeks . i find this ridiculous and would not re commend this auto shop . i just moved here and aamco had left a bad taste in my mouth . they gave me back my car not running at all and with a dent .	3150
0	i have never worked in fast food before , so i 'm not sure how the whole drive thru order system works . i 've never been somewhere where they are constantly screwing up the order , trying to give me food i did n't order , or drinks that i did n't order . sure , everyone has their days , but this seems to be consistent with this location . the older lady working the drive-through window in the mornings is constantly confused as to what you have ordered . if there were a location more convenient to me , i would definitely be visiting them	1532
0	i 'm shocked by the overall rating for this place . it should be lower or a zero . i went in to the store to ask about breast pumps and stood with my husband looking for some help while i watched several saleswomen stand nearby taking to each other knowing full well i was looking for some assistance . when i walked over asking for help , it appeared i was bothersome and got short one-worded answers . needless to say , i did not purchase the pump here . i would rather continue to travel further to make purchases than to visit this establishment again .	3789
1	our waitress at the bar was super nice . i had the chicken sandwich of some sort which was okay but the buffalo chicken sandwich was delicious	717
0	as fans of the show `` tanked , '' we decided to stop by here during our recent trip to vegas . we have had large fish tanks for many , many years , so we wanted to see what they do there . sadly , the smell of cigarette smoke was so thick we could n't stay for more than a few minutes . i understand that this is their own business and they can do whatever the heck they want there , but it is open to the public and not everyone wants to be around cancer stick smoke .	2440
1	i 've been to this location several times , each time it has been with a big group of people and only once have we had a reservation . usually we go for office lunches . they are always friendly and i have no complaints about the food , it 's always really good . the service is a little slow but that could be due to the fact that we usually are there with a a group of 10 people .	534
0	great service ! ! ! nails chipped off in like a week though : ( . for as much as i spent , i wanted them to last the 2 weeks that they normally would . their nail art is beautiful though , too bad it did n't last .	1429
0	this place is okay but the price bumps it down to a two star . i will say though the oysters were some of the best i have had in a while .	603
1	i had chance while visiting toronto to go the the beauty bar with my cousin while she went for hydra facial i decided to get my teeth whitening done . the experience itself was peaceful and the staff really educated me through the whitening process and the exact shade i will be expecting . it 's been two weeks and whites are still pearly wish they had beauty bar here in oc but until then will defiantly be going in to see them on my next visit .	2847
1	i tried doggie doo 's because it is close to my house . i have stayed with them for several years because of the service i receive . the whole staff is friendly , and they treat your pet like it was their own . i would recommend this shop to anyone . they are the best i have found , and i 've lived in phoenix for 62 years .	1647
0	please instruct the kids rinsing the ground and equipment at the end of the day to not spray when a vehicle is going thru . they ended up spraying dirt into my vehicle after it was clean from the wash . so a car wash wasted . wait the 30 seconds for the car to get thru , then resume splattering dirt and grime everywhere . simple training . please remind or retrain the people in the wash bay .	2939
0	i ordered from ramados through just eat . when my order was half an hour late , i called the restaurant to ask about it . the woman who answered the phone was incredibly dismissive . i was actually taken aback at how rude she was . when i asked her if she knew how much longer it would be she said she had no way of knowing and hung up on me . i finally got my food and in fact , the chicken is good but my salad arrived soggy . i 'm just shocked at how outrageously bad their customer service is .	1109
0	upon walking in the establishment you will notice the restaurant to be well decorated and spacious . the food was well presented . the freshness of the sushi is questionable . the tuna that i received smelled and the quantity of sashimi was disheartening . they like to use a lot of artificial crab . my guest became ill shortly after eating there and my stomach felt off as well . i usually eat at takumi on the east side of madison and was expecting more from this place being as it is in middleton . i will continue to stick with takumi on the east side and muramoto in hilldale .	446
1	this place is wonderful . always honest and fast . comfortable , clean waiting room with good coffee . the guys are always so thorough with their inspections and honest about pricing and repairs . i have had several horribly experiences with being price gouged and lied to because i am a woman who knows little about cars . it 's hard to find honest and respectable people who will be upfront with you about costs and repairs but these are the people ! ! they have done routine oil changes for me all the way to extensive issues . i would not trust anyone else in this area with my car . awesome group of mechanics ! !	1055
0	the pizza here was okay . small portion sizes for the price paid . $ 16 plus tax for a small hawaiian pizza ( which was only 4 slices ) + additional charge for spelt crust ... generous toppings on the pizza . i would n't go back nor would i recommend this place .	1063
1	tres rios ( the new name for estrella mountain golf ) is a favorite of our group . we like the conditions of the greens and fairways . we think that the conditions are one of the best in the west valley . also , we find the fees to be a value . the course tends to be 'flat ' and straight . also , it is not unusual for errant balls to come into your fairway as the holes are close to each other . many greens are slightly raised and sloped . best for the long - straight hitter who has great touch around the greens and bunkers .	1138
1	comfortable beds , working tv , breakfast with waffles ... convenient ... what more could you ask for ? note that the bathroom was tiny with one of those sliding doors , and the cabinet/desk the tv was on was scratched to death- the child commented . would definitely need to ask for a handicap room if you needed access to a larger bathroom . just fyi . but clean sheets , more than enough towels , the blow dryer worked ... it was fine for an overnight .	2484
0	two stars because our waiter was fantastic and our steaks were good , despite the ... ... long wait time , plus broken pager so we waited an extra 15 min . total wait time 35 min ! do n't order the skinny lime margarita it was like pouring straight lime juice in your mouth- it 's less than 200 calories because you can only have one sip . orders were wrong and service took forever . wo n't be back ever ! i hope our super kind , apologetic waiter finds a new job- and gets all our tip ! he deserves it !	560
1	quality was great , i ordered the cookies and some cake truffles . holy bejeezus those truffles were huge ! the cake truffles were moist but not gooey like the starbucks cake pops , which is how i always want those to taste , but they never do . the cookies - sour cream sugar cookies- were as moist as they sound and again huge . individually wrapped , the price to quality ratio is way in favor of the customer .	1673
0	i called to try and become an established patient for my new kitten and was told i could n't get an appointment for 5-6 weeks and they were not willing to answer my questions over the phone . i was also told they could n't refer me to anyone else in the area and that i needed to start taking my kitten somewhere else . the receptionist did n't even allow me to make a spray/neuter appointment for the future .	2009
0	do not rent a car from this place ! ! i was late to pick up the car because delayed flight . even i was late it was same date but they canceled my reservation and charge full price which is $ 105 for 2days . it was compact car . beware this guys . of course they are rude . and it is far from airport . so inconvenient .	3576
0	i 'm probably the most dissatisfied patient ever ! this place has the rudest and unprofessional front office staff ! kris and susan would talk about patients so the people in the waiting area could hear them . so rude ! they would lie and overcharge people as well ! in the middle of orthodontic care the dentist/orthodontist up and left without any reason causing me to go to a different office to finish out my care . not one bit of compensation was offered . again , unprofessional ! stay clear of this office or any of their sister offices as well !	3766
1	very friendly staff and students with great prices for simple color . long process but totally worth it for the end result	354
0	worst experience . the so called senior stylist had no idea how to cut or colour short hair for woman . 3 hours into appointment my hair looked yellow like straw and stylist was too afraid to cut . paid 200 dollars for a colour and cut i would expect from a junior stylist . called back the next day and owner did n't even offer apology . actually would n't accept that there was a problem . arrogance to say the least . will never go back here nor recommend anyone waste their money .	1789
0	this is more of a review on paradise bakery in general not just this location . way overrated and overpriced . i keep trying to convince myself that this place is good but i just do n't see it . every time i go i try and pick something that ca n't be messed up and i know i 'll love . unfortunately that never seems to happen . i 'm always left wishing i had ordered something else or nothing at all .	701
0	we 've been coming here since 2016. for the first time today , one of the staff told us that outside food is not allowed . i look around and everybody has their `` outside '' food in the designated eating area . if this is really an issue , then i think you should be consistent and let everybody know before coming in that outside food is not allowed .	1631
0	ate at this place once or twice when i lived near the area . the service is always nice and the inside is clean , but the menu is quite inauthentic and overall a bit bland .	1088
0	totally boring , i am glad my trip there was free .	3891
0	worst customer service/loyalty ever . i 've been shopping here for about 18 years . not because they 're the least expensive or carry a unique product but because they 're a local business . now , the first time i have a problem with a particular shoe due to quality issues , they refuse to make it right . i wo n't be back . i recommend you take your business elsewhere .	1627
0	i really do n't understand why so many people have this place 4-5 stars . the vanilla ice cream does n't have a trace of vanilla or milk taste , and the dip is so sweet it burn my throat , i even doubt they use real chocolate for the dip because it is chewy and not crunchy like other franchises like dq . if you do n't care much about flavours and just want something soft and cold and taste like refine sugar , it is a good place because it is so cheap . but i rather spend more money on some really ice cream .	3331
0	this place used to be a fun area to shop and hang out at but now at least half to 3/4 of the stores are gone . the food court inside only had a pizza place left . do n't waste your time unless you want to go to grab a bite to eat at hard rock or another restaurant outside .	3152
0	this staff started out with a bang during first few weeks of opening but is going down fast . lazy workers , poor management and terrible food . glad ihop will be here soon .	672
1	alberto the manager and his team are phenomenal ! they are honest , professional , and quick . they also do mechanical jobs . do n't trust your car anywhere else these guys are incredible ! ! !	2365
1	yep , as good as it gets , consistently . jessica helped me today and was so competent . i have been going t this ups for 2 years and every employee been exceptional .	329
1	as a senior citizen and female to boot it is critical that i have a place to service and repair my car that i trust . mike and the staff at this meineke location fit that bill . mike is great about honoring not only the warranty on his work but the warranty on the parts he uses . this is the only location that i trust my car to . these guys are honest and fair .	1086
1	mall just finished an extensive remodel , the scary elements we saw a year ago are gone . clean , most spaces filled again . basic finishing touch is to reseal and restripe parking lot . tearing down motel 6s nearby should be done to finish this project .	2594
0	i went here on wednesday and friday , its alright . i notice lax at luxor had a bigger crowd on wednesday . not much night life happening on wednesday . friday is a sauage fest ... if you like to meet losers and many weird guys this is the place on friday ... . the crowd is low class ... .there is no line ... they use a circle like system like the bank ... in order to build a busy crowded look for the line . best way to get around this is go straight up to the doorman and introduce yourself and say hi and wait .	3596
0	this place has horrible customer service , called and the female on the phone stayed hey start taking pm clients at 5:15p , got here at 5:45pm and apparently they stop taking color clients at 530 ... they should tell you that you only have a 15 minute window as they did n't allow me to book an appointment . the girl at counter with hair in bun was not even apologetic , i explained and she said well even then it 's almost 6 ... i have never left a bad comment but if this is how they are trained to treat people my god ! ! ! !	354
0	ignored me numerous times when i have visited . as a result , i bought nothing . from what i understand if you walk in wearing makeup you get attention . i am also 50+ and not fancy .	2574
0	i called to sign up for another year ... and was constantly put on hold . horrible customer service ! ! ! ! needless to say i went with another gym = )	3898
0	food was good but service was n't the best . we ordered our food and that came pretty quick . they forgot our drinks and my husband let the girl at the register know . she said they were behind and she will give us our drinks when she can . there were only 2 people sitting down , beside us . there were more people working in the back , and if you ca n't take care of your current customers , you should n't take in more customers .	580
0	i purchased a car through these people and it was bad from the get go . ultimately i ended up doing a voluntary surrender of the car . less than a week later i saw the car back on the lot for sale at the same price i bought it for . i also wittnessed a couple purchase this vehicle . fastforward 2 years . i get served with papers saying they are sueing me for the full amount of the vehicle plus $ 3000 interest . how wrong is this ? im so glad i took photos of the car on the lot , the vin number , and the couple buing the car . see you in court southwest financial !	3305
1	we love this place . we went a few months ago for my son 's first hair cut and they were very accommodating with us wanting to keep as much of his hair as possible , even with it being a sunday they were very patient . i came back last week to get my handsome guy a trim and was more than blown away . his stylist was jazmine . she was very friendly and kept her attention on declan the whole time . i could go to any kid based salon , but i will continue to bring him here because of their customer service .	260
0	this is likely very hit and miss . while the store is nicely laid out , the merchandise seems to fall heavily into the pre-teen forever 21 category , at least when i visited . lots of cheap , crop top types , or thin poly tops . dresses fared a bit better . there is a small rack of more `` designer '' goods , priced higher than justifiable given their condition . racks of shoes spread across the top of dress shelves ; this seemed a bit better in condition . overall not sure this is worth the time .	1446
0	i arrived at this bank this morning at 9:20am and decided to use their drive thru service . i have been waiting over 20 minutes and my paperwork is still sitting in the carrier waiting for someone to process it . this bank has terrible customer service , it appears that they are under staffed or lacking in training their personnel how to serve their depositors . i would not recommend this bank .	950
1	review is for happy hour only ! p.j . clarke 's is located in the forum shops on the bottom level . ( just in case you 're rushing to make the happy hour and have no idea where to go . ) go for the $ 1 oysters for happy hour everyday from 3-6pm ! you have the option to sit at the regular bar or oyster bar . the oysters are shucked and on ice , then served with 3 sauces -- cocktail , horseradish and a shallot vinaigrette . it 's great to sit back and relax after shopping and walking on the strip . it 's my new go-to spot whenever i 'm in vegas !	1538
1	went to shane to get an old tattoo covered . dude delivered , it came out better than i had hoped . very professional , knew when i needed to take a break . i would recommend him and his shop to anyone . shop is very clean and the artists are friendly as well as professional . i will be back .	1658
1	love this place ! all the food is delicious and fresh ; the pizza had a beautiful , fluffy , crispy crust , a wonderful sauce , and fresh vegetables . i 'd put it right up there with any pittsburgh pizza anywhere . soups are delicious , too . the service is good and friendly , the place is cute and pleasant , comfortable , and warm in ambiance . its attached to a bar with great music , but the doors are kept closed and you can not even hear that theres a bar there . all in all , cant wait to go back !	718
1	did the day pool tour and complete shit show in an amazing way . great group and amazing host-they better have tipped her appropriately ! definitely a must do !	2122
0	when did it become the norm on a deluxe wash not to wipe the interior down . i 'm not asking to have it scrubbed , but at least wipe the dust off the dash . also , why ask for a scent to put in your car and then not do it . mediocre place at best !	1502
1	lol it stinks like a massive period here ... women have poor hygiene out here imho ... as if some funky phoenix females rubbed their fetid genitals all over the weight equipment ... there are no punching bags here : ( ( still i enjoy the branch for the first time so far	1802
0	i drove out from tempe with about $ 100 worth of alterations , chose this place based on the yelp reviews - big mistake . rude from the minute i walked in the door . when i finally got fed up with the seamstress 's attitude and said i would just go somewhere else she replied , `` good . '' i guess getting back to her sandwich was more important than being courteous . not recommended - find another place .	2702
1	great food ! ! ! i was feening carne asada fries for lunch break so myself and a few girls swung by . i am so happy that i found this place the fries were on point the nacho cheese made it all come together perfectly- i ordered extra on the side but it 's not really needed . they give you plenty .	857
1	one of our favorite italian restaurants . fabulous pizza and light & tasty chew pose ravioli that never disappoints . fabulous friendly staff . a neighborhood gem for casual dining .	567
1	i came to this firestone 15 minutes before closing . i was overdue on an oil change and making a trip the next day with limited time to take care of the change . the associates were willing to stay a bit late to make the oil change happen for me so i would n't have to worry about it the next day . it was really great of them to go above and beyond for me . i had an excellent experience at this location .	1297
1	love this place . i 'm a totally inexperienced dance mom , this place comes highly recommended by the experienced dance moms , the staff is always extremely helpful and patient and i ca n't believe how reasonable the prices are !	3906
0	four people in pharmacy and ca n't fill a prescription for 30 pills in less than hour . wo n't be back .	3810
1	excellent job . bravo again discount tire ! kyle is a star , friendly , patient and competent . i am very detail oriented and although i too can be patient , i want my stuff done perfect . i bring my cars in spotless , wheels shiny and clean ( even the back side of the rims ) and i expect a job well done with no mistakes and no nicks and discount tire always delivers . i have purchased tires and or wheels for more than 25 of my vehicles over the last 20 years exclusively from discount tire who are truly my favorite us company under the `` best customer service '' category .	3231
1	i 'm a regular at sculpture nails- i go in every two weeks for a shellac manicure and regular pedicure . i usually walk-in as i find that booking an appointment does n't really help you if they have others waiting when you arrive . the shop managers never turn anyone away- they try to accommodate every walk-in , which is why others have mentioned that they often experience some wait time . the nail technicians are quite good , i am always happy with the results i get , especially for such a great price . the only time i 've been disappointed is if my nails are done by a technician in training , but i suppose that 's the case anywhere .	3757
1	daily specials are great value . i had a delicious ravioli dish and the risotto was also very good , each at 13 $ and 9 $ ( half price mondays ! ) large potions . and half priced wine ! you ca n't go wrong .	102
1	incredible again today in uptown charlotte ! got a chorzio and shiro taco with a side of aleppo rice . never disappointed ! if you have seen the line but have never stepped into it ... you are missing out . plus , they are fast so do n't expect to be there very long . great job again roots !	872
0	always get your order wrong . no matter how many times to clarify . food was cold and disappointing . go elsewhere .	859
1	amazing experience will definitely go back ! they were super helpful from the beginning in designing the cake and it turned out absolutely perfect ! above and beyond the cake looking good it was delicious as well we did chocolate on the top and funfetti with strawberry on the bottom and it was a big hit at the birthday party ! ! !	782
0	per request , i had sent over pictures of the areas which had not been sufficiently cleaned over the first three visits ; i received a phone call this morning offering a partial refund for the services due to the inconvenience and ultimately lack of job completed ( they would have come out a fifth time ; however , i had finished the cleaning myself rather than waiting . ) i will say that their customer service is certainly attentive and responsive ; however , customer service unfortunately does not equal a clean house .	3647
1	got the groupon for the two drinks and they are so yummy . the portion size is huge .	1071
1	this is the place were come with a medical issue when we ca n't see our pcp . the staff here is so nice , professional and so caring . we have never had a bad experience here . we habe had the same doctor on two occasions and he had been wonderful ! he puts my kids at ease and listens to our concerns . i highly recommend coming here if you need medical care .	3698
1	great food , friendly service , lovely atmosphere . not `` too cool for school '' or intimidating , just warm and welcoming ( literally , warm : they have a fireplace ) ! it 's a pub but it 's a little bit fancier and has fewer blaring tvs . the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is that i found the beers and wines a little pricey and i have only tried the nachos ( which were to die for ) .	348
1	new to the area and this place definitely lives up to its good reviews ! the woman who did my acrylic fill & gel manicure did a great job and was very friendly . the price is reasonable given the good service and nice people . will definitely go back !	3711
0	the worst customer service i have ever experienced ! ! would recommend going to a different emissions testing if you want to be treated like a person . both employee and manager were very rude and unprofessional .	138
1	the best value-for-your-money portuguese place in montreal . great chicken and friendly service . a must-see .	1109
0	not a bad joint , but the crowd tends to be too college for me . they used to have a lot more pool tables , and now calling it a cue club for two tables seems misleading . the music on weekends is usually top 40s with an emphais on hip hop , and they play accompanying videos on the big screen tvs behind the bar . i imagine this switches up to sports during the day or weekday nights . drinks prices are average . the line to get in late on fri and sat not a big deal , goes pretty quick and possibly a small cover ( $ 3- $ 5 ) .	1966
0	longtime , customer service skills suck ! , i walk in just to pick up a order , broad walks past me to answer a phone order	1397
0	this has to be the worst hospital around . the emergency room had a 7 hour wait ... i came in by ambulance ... ..had to have a family member take me to another hospital ... .never ever again ! i had high fever and stomach pain..shakes and chest pain.the nurse probably still thinks i 'm in the hallway where she left me to die .	3131
1	awesome gym . amazing classes , and i have almost never had a problem getting a machine i want . also love the sauna and stram room ... makes me feel like i 'm at the spa everytime i go . the one on decatur is a beautiful facility ; everything is brand new and always very clean . love it !	3268
0	this is the third time i 've been here to this location and i 've received the same crappy service from the same waitress . her name is leslie and if you can , avoid being in her section at all costs ! she came and checked on my table once in 45 minutes . my cup of coffee sat empty for 30 and only when i talked to the manager did i get any kind of service . never coming back to this location . would give 0 stars if possible .	346
0	yeah , not really my thing . and by that , i mean : i like my beer cold . i like my beer bubbly . service was great , crowd was mixed ( tad fratty . but i expected worse ) , patio is awesome and comfy ( but seriously smokey , which my lung-healthy cohort kept pointing out ) . they pour ye olde guinness properly , and that 's what we came for . but would i come back ? not unless they figure out how to properly chill and store their libations . a warm , flat beer , even on $ 3 pint night , ai n't gon na cut it .	1179
0	there are many different and creative food options . that i like . however , there really is not anything to do there . walk around and spend money . the prices are considerably higher this year then they have been in years past . walking through the buildings vendors are particularly pushy and this is only the 2nd day of the fair . there needs to be more events or shows during the day . the weather was nice today . walking to the fair we were hit up for money by several people . do not like that atmosphere . the 2 rating is for the food . high $ $ $ time out though .	2076
1	yuki did my nails and she was very professional and did a great job ! i 'm amazed at how great the services are for such a low price . for sure am coming back !	3811
0	large bakery , with tons of space + wifi . the cakes and pastries are tasty , and as noted in other reviews are pretty inexpensive . the service is n't the best , but if you want to be left alone and are here to work , it is n't a problem . they serve you at your table . they also have a meagre selection of beers and wine .	1851
0	eh have had way better blended coffee drinks . it tasted almost nothing like mocha and the ninja blender they used should be swapped for a higher quality blender that actually blends the drink correctly . the girl looked like she was struggling with what she had .	3072
0	just got a burntwood burger at the burntwood tavern . taste like a big glob of shit ! for $ 13.00 . a $ 13,00 pile of shit burger , could of had 2 whoppers from burger king on sale for $ 6.00 would of been a much better choice . do n't waste your money ! 2 burgers 3 beers and a kids dinner $ 68.00 !	632
1	this is definitely a gemstone ! they are serious about their foods ! my favorite is banh xeo . it 's by far the best vietnamese crepe i 've eaten . it far surpassed the ones in westminster california . they make it big and put many things on it such as shreded squid/octopus ( ? ) , pork belly , yellow beans , bean sprouts , etc.. u guys definitely should try this one !	673
1	dr. tummala is an excellent ob-gyn ! we had to move to phoenix when my wife was 39 1/2 weeks pregnant and she was able to take her as her patient . my wife was in labor for 36+ hours and dr. tummala ensured it was a normal delivery without going for c section . i was amazed how she handled the delivery when there appeared to be a little complication towards the end of the delivery . would recommend dr tummala any day !	2643
0	fair at best . smallest buffet i have ever seen . not enough buisness to keep food fresh or hot	1524
1	love this place ! i drive an hour and a half just to visit this store and get the in the incenses i want . i am bum that they do n't sell mood candles anymore tho !	1233
0	food was horrible . only thing good was raspberry martinis . went here for my birthday thinking it would be like the one in la ... boy was i wrong . horrible service and food was terrible . nothing like the one in la ... that one is great .	971
1	great bowling deals . the pizza there is amazing ... seriously , i love pizza and was very surprised to find such good ( tasty , crunchy , and flavorful ) pizza at a bowling alley ?	2235
1	i have been thinking about lasik surgery for years . these guys made my decision easy . not only was it the best decision but the staff was so great . i was very nervous but they told me everything i needed to know and made me feel calm . they are the best ! !	2312
1	we 've been to pigley 's several times now , and always sit at the bar . the atmosphere is very fun and the decor is family friendly . the female bartender makes the best bloody mary ! we usually order the jojo 's hot wings , they are fabulous ! the staff is friendly ! i would highly recommend pigley 's for a fun dining experience .	144
1	a great place to get the staples like onions , avocados , beans , rice , fruit , bread , oil , etc . usually same quality as full-blown grocery stores , but i find the prices a bit lower . the produce ( i.e. , lettuce , cilantro , broccoli , etc . ) can sometimes look a little limp , so i usually go elsewhere for these . they do have great sales once in a while , with pineapple and melons and such for only a buck or two .	682
1	i went for restaurant week , a good opportunity to try new restaurants , and was not disappointed . i had the charleston grits , salad , pesto encrusted salmon , and creme brûlée . i was not a fan of the creme brûlée , i thought the caramel tasted burnt . i 've never had it before so it could 've just been me and not that it really was n't good . otherwise everything was great and service was great .	1147
0	service was quick , but the price charged was considerably higher than the quote . when i asked about the difference , i was told the person who gave the quote did n't know what they were doing . will most likeky also contact the bbb . if you chose this company , get a quote in writing .	3663
1	i 'm glad its 24 hours nothing more frustrating that them opening at 8 when most people commute before that . they always have what i need , and some things i do n't need , damn you cream soda . also its nice to know you can get sunscreen at 5am , or other items late at night like cold meds or anything really .	1733
1	so much fun . the food is great ( maybe slightly pricey ) but i love the bar service , the excellent cocktails especially when you challenge the bartender to make something that he ; s been working on . love it .	1305
1	man ! this is one good sandwich shop ! top quality ingredients yield big flavor . i went based on the reviews here and the sandwich pics . seriously delish , the bread , the meats , the lettuce , avocado , tomato , condiments it all comes together beautifully . the owner is hard at work delivering the goods and i hope he has big success with his shop . p.s . someone mentioned in another review that the ends of the bread were cut -- i 've never had mine like that . it 's perfect .	1554
1	this place is super clean . the staff is so nice and the food is great ! it 's not greasy or overly breaded . i love the apples with toffee sauce too . you could put that toffee on anything and it would be amazing . the sauces are delicious . my personal favs so far are the sweet heat and creamy garlic . i 've tried the chicken tenders and grilled turkey sandwich , both had great flavor and served hot and fresh ! i definitely recommend trying this place !	998
0	nothing positive to say , as a matter of fact this is my second one star rating ! this place sucks balls !	2765
1	absolutely yummmmmmy - real mexican food ( like you 'd find in south phoenix ) at an affordable price ! fast , great guacamole , taquitos , machaca burrito ( so good i ate there twice in a day 's time ) . yay ! ! ! got ta try this place ! ! ! ! !	1410
1	wow ! just like i remember growing up back on long island . same great taste ! bit pricey but was totally worth it ! glad to see this chain down here . i did see the old bad reviews about service . i 've only been here twice but the service was top notch both times . older gentlemen first visit and two round ladies the second . all were super friendly and polite . guess they 've changed staff or realized they were messing up lol . big thumbs up from me !	1201
1	had take away the other night from here . got the pulled pork tacos . they were really good and had plenty of filling . they are so well priced also and the portions are very generous . going back for lunch there today to try something else . finally , a great mexican in the beaches . definitely worth a try .	65
1	really liked their old fashioned bourbon and who doesnt love a buck a shuck ? was happy to be able to just walk in on a tuesday night ( after a disappointing meal at fring 's ) to grab a drink and and a dozen oysters .	3039
1	i 've been here a few times now and it 's been consistently good . the place has good flow of people coming in for take out and to dine in . decent food and it 's always fresh .	331
1	as someone who loves the great outdoors , i have to admit , i love bass pro shops . i 'm not a survivalist or a tree hugger , i just enjoy outdoor activities to include camping , fishing and hiking etc . it does n't matter if i do n't need to buy anything , i enjoy just walking around looking to see what 's for and or on sale . bass pro shops is one of the few stores that can make me relate to how people can spend hours , shopping in the same store . i 've done it on more than a few occasions .	2601
0	basically the united airlines of hotels do not book here . they will give away your room and offer nothing in compensation . arrived after a long red-eye from vancouver and even though we booked an early check-in , the front desk told us they had given our room away . they offered nothing to ease the inconvenience , told us we 'd have to wait another 7 hours to check in , and were rude . avoid at all costs . service does n't come close to the price .	1859
1	been coming here for a few years now and the prices are pretty good on products . sometimes they have awesome deals when you can get them . when i was doing nails all the time i was here every other week . the staff are pretty helpful as well . sometimes they lag behind in getting the brand new stuff you see in the magazines but eventually they get it .	2182
1	i love this place for my little ones . i have 3 children here and they are extremely loved . my oldest tells me she misses her teachers on the weekend . melanie and toccara have done an amazing job managing . my favorite thing is that they have cameras so you can monitor your kids all day .	2085
1	so far , i have had a great time at the district on apache , first as a guest and now as a resident . the maintenance staff are a great group of guys , and they are timely in their request fulfillment . i love waking up and going to the gym every day , and it has everything i need ! the pool is always fun , and the community events make me feel welcomed and included . overall , an unbeatable experience that is making my senior year a dream come true .	748
1	great place , super friendly staff . good place to meet for happy hour . nice patio , perfect for summer cocktails . i did n't realize they also do catering , great for grad parties , family reunions , box lunch .	1380
0	i have never been treated so poorly by a doctor 's office in my life . inexperienced rude staff . the pa and medical assistant were terrible . unprofessional and uncaring . it 's so upsetting . also the bathroom was filthy and the trash was overflowing in the room . sad !	3349
0	what is great about this starbucks just inside the golden nugget casino on fremont street is ... what is really good about this starbucks just inside the golden nugget casino on fremont street is ... what is ok about this starbucks just inside the golden nugget casino on fremont street is ... what sucks about this starbucks just inside the golden nugget casino on fremont street is ... it is expensive like airport starbucks only even more so . like two tall ( small ) drinks for about $ 8 bucks . the service was not great and the place is grungier than your typical starbucks .	683
0	went here for 7 years and hated the staff every single time . i tolerated the rude , incompetent employees because i loved my dr so much . my dr had since moved.. thank god ! so that place can kiss my a** .	3059
0	electronics is not open 24 hours and they have no signs at the front of the store that explain this ; instead you have to walk to the back of the store to see the section barricaded with a sign that says they will reopen at 7am	2913
1	i had been going here for a few years , moved away for a year , and just came back and am going to cutie nail spa again - i still love it ! i always get a mani/pedi for $ 45 , the color lasts a good while , all the employees are nice and professional , and the spa is always clean and is right around the corner from my house !	3047
1	we had a great car buying experience last weekend with these guys . our salesman chip was very friendly and helpful . like any car dealership , you always get the usual run around , but we felt that these guys did a overall great job in treating us right . i will be back in the future and will suggest this dealership to others as well .	2717
1	the cheese bread selection at loblaws is just so amazing i am so happy . it destroys all its competitors cheese crossaints bread rolls and sticks . i still love loblaws	2402
0	beautiful ceremony and i was happy with everything- up until my mother in law ( without knowing the rules and what package we purchased ) snapped a picture of my husband and i moments after the ceremony and the entire staff flipped out , threatened to withhold all our photos , demanded more money and borderline ruined our small ceremony . for that , i have to give a single star . oh , and i feel like they sabotaged our photo package after the massive fight and charged my card more than we agreed to . not professional .	542
0	# 1 pho is not # 1 pho at all ... ... pho was too sweet in opinion . vermecili was actually not bad but shrimps on there taste rotten . this place is not clean from its appearance , menu was greasy n dirty , same thing with utensil n cups . lost my appetite before the food being served .	784
1	great store . great selection . the service is great . i wish the company would improve their website and ecommerce business . there are products listed but no sizes available . i ordered a jacket and found out a few days later they do n't have any in stock . the online shopping experience is mediocre .	2743
0	im sad that this placed closed since i just bought 2- $ 20 groupons here . : ( it was a great deal too ! currently 9/1/15 -- i got back $ 20 in groupon bucks in my account after emailing them for over a week and 3 emails later . still waiting on the other one since i gave it as a gift not sure if they are going to give me credit or ? i guess another theater company is taking over called roadhouse cinemas . see photo .	2486
1	gentlemen here are always wonderful and nice and i am glad the location is conventional	25
0	just left their happy hour . food and drink specials are really good but the bar service is definitely in need of an upgrade . it took 10 minutes just to order my first drink and i waited so long for her to come around to ask for my second drink that i just gave up . bartender seemed to be overwhelmed at times then goofing off with other coworkers instead of checking on people at bar at other times . this would 've easily been a 4 or 5 star review with better service .	1094
1	this review is for the pie . it 's pretty darn good and on wednesdays it 's free . chocolate silk and mixed berry pie are particularly tasty , especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream . coffee stinks however . service is very friendly . nice addition to the neighborhood . i like the mid-century modern decor .	672
0	being told 3 times by 3 different employees that you `` do n't get commission , '' and still shadowed throughout the store . hearing the first one radio in my clothing description over his ear piece . the place has a huge selection of nice , but expensive , things . but everyone working there felt like a robot . i 've felt less hassled at a car dealership ; no joke . we did actually purchase something though . a dinning room table set in clearance . everything about it was totally fine . very good price for a table and 4 chairs . biggest issue is the customer service . place gave me the creeps .	2071
0	this is the worst place to rent a car , especially for locals . they require a $ 500 deposit on a major credit card and no unlimited miles ... just stay away	3576
0	worst pedicure i 've ever had ! a blind man could do better . ever nail is a different length , barely fixed my cuticles , and the paint job it horrible . the tech seemed more concerned with her own nails than mine . i expected a lot more for $ 40 ! ! !	2035
0	this place is a total rip off ... ! ! ! ... we took our ipad in to have the screen fixed ... we were told that they would tell us that the lcd was broken ... sure enough that is what they told us ... the only thing wrong with it was the screen was cracked ... beware of this company ... ! ! ! ..wo n't go there again ... kelly it was n't under my name , but my daughters . the truth remains the same !	339
1	what a cute store ! pratt 's has all sorts of animals that you ca n't usually find in the same place . everything is clean and organized and the animals look healthy and happy . the staff is helpful and the prices are good . even if you 're not yet in the market to buy it 's a fun shop to visit and touch some of the animals . definitely a good place to get supplies !	386
1	i had a fever . and the only prescription was more lechon . luckily , cebu fixed me right up . i got some food to go and it was exactly what i needed . the lechon kawali was nice and crispy and i really enjoyed the sauces that came with it . the staff was friendly and got me my order in a timely manner . since cebu is on my way home from work , i 'll definitely be back soon .	658
1	very clean salon , only had a short wait and came out with a high quality haircut . would definitely recommend	887
1	chill place , good drinks , fun time . good bartenders and bodyguards keep it safe . cool stufff , recommend to anyone	3336
0	horrible customer service almost 1 1/2 hours in line and there were only 2-3 customer service reps with several more not doing anything . will not rent from avis again	3129
0	in fact they do take forever to take you in and the staff is rude.. i will update if my ultrasound goes well i might give them a couple more stars otherwise it would be a shame those 20 miles i drove here not worth it .	3313
0	have tried to get ahold of the firearms counter 5 times today and seems no one answers . terrible customer service .	2601
0	way overpriced ! ! ! the salons i 've gone to charge around $ 35 for a full face threading . they charged $ 40 which is not bad but , it did n't include under the chin ! $ 60 later ... i have to pluck some hairs from under my chin and even out my eyebrows . i would not recommend this place .	3016
0	tried to buy a wedding gift . 2 people at the register , which by the way is unusual to find a soul , clueless . they had no idea what was in the store . they also have quit wrapping gifts . tj maxx here i come . why bother with parking and high prices when you get no service ? ? ?	2910
1	i had a positive experience here a few months ago and i 'm finally getting around to writing this . i had a need to return shoes purchased from a different ross as i was getting ready to head out of town for a very special event . i realized i had forgotten the receipt when i ( finally ) got to the counter . customer service could have easily have turned me away , but did n't , for which i was thankful .	482
1	i tried here finally ! ! ! it took forever for them to open . we tried omurice and honey butter fried chicken wing . both of them were pretty good and the omurice was large enough for 2people . i will be back to try more dishes and give updates .	1028
0	i would not recommend this restaurant . the veggie wrap was slimy , wet , and soft of the outside making it difficult to grab with my hands . the contents inside were mushy and not appetizing . the line was very loud and the staff were carrying their own conversations making it difficult to understand the ordering process . this place needs some help .	126
1	this place is a small little gem and very busy . the tables were full and the phone was ringing off the hook with take out orders . as i waited for my take out i was served a hot tea which was nice since it was so cold out . i ordered green curry with veggies and tofu . it was very flavorful and very fresh . will definitely visit again .	594
0	product received in the mail was absolutely destroyed . not in a sellable or useable condition in any way whatsoever . so instead of returning it for a refund or contacting the store for a replacement i decided to leave them negative feedback . thanks for nothing staci k .	2570
1	much better alternative than b-dubs did n't have any problem with wait time on a friday night . if you do n't like your fries drowned in salt , i 'd request for them to go light on it	1395
0	tried to eat here but the waitstaff was sleeping in a booth with their shoes kicked off . no one woke up so rather than disturb their sleep , we left .	895
0	reasonable prices for good mexican food ... the service is good and with a great atmosphere to hang out . the bartender forgot to bring my drink and then charged me for it ... he brought out a non itemized bill ... not really happy about that . i felt like he was saving an extra drink for later .	1558
0	i only stop here when i have to . no drive thru . it is usually packed with all the taxi drivers from the strip . they often mess up your order , and it seems like you either wait too long in line , or for your drink .	2723
0	horrible service . i understand the credit card system is down but the gal was n't helpful or informative . 18.99 for an exterior wash ? that 's ridiculous ! fabulous freddie 's is only 3 miles away and totally worth the drive ! never again . even if your down the street from both of my homes !	2359
1	i found this walmart to be bigger than most having a larger selection of food than i 've seen before . sure , you get to mingle with the walmartians but it 's really not that bad .	2141
0	i got ramen noodle yesterday for lunch , but noodle became brown and got moldy . i like japanese snack but they do n't carry enough anymore . only 1good thing they open till 11:00pm .	715
0	everyone running around with towels on , snubbing each other . why go to a bath house for sex and be shy and snobby ? ? wasted my money . i 'll try a different bathhouse next time .	3345
0	used to go to the salon regularly . owner is egotistical . hair looked good but the vibe is not for me . always seemed chaotic and unorganized . witnessed employees being rude to each other and customers . glad my stylist is elsewhere now .	300
0	i have been to this restaurant multiple times . the food tastes great , and the setting is quaint . however , the service today was terrible . we sat down , ordered , and were told an hour later that our order ticket was lost and the waitress needed our order again . we asked how long it would be at this point and were told `` just a few minutes '' . twenty minutes later , still no food , so we told them to cancel the order and we left . this is really unfortunate because the food tastes great , but it 's not worth the service .	1329
1	the customer service is awesome here . every time i 've gone ( which is quite often ) all the girls are super super sweet . the other day , my bed was n't working so in return for my inconvenience , the girl working more than willingly upgraded me to the best bed there is for free !	3104
0	i was not impressed with laser528 . she runs late for her appointments , tries to upsell you with add ons after the treatment and used only factory settings during my session . i came back for my 2nd appointment ( hoping she would increase the power on her machine ) and she would n't even treat me because of my first review which was honest . i did n't get a call canceling my appointment . this is unprofessional .	2620
0	this was by far the worst pho i ever had . definitely will not return . broth was flavorless and the meat was very cheap , not even edible . my boyfriend had the egg noodles instead of the rice noodles and it was no better . it 's pretty cheap and the food comes out very quick , hence why i give it two stars instead of one .	784
0	december 23rd and one register open with a line wrapping around the store . but there are employees just wandering around the store . when we finally got to the register , my husband caught them over charging us .	3943
0	sloooooow service ! 15 minutes for a carmel macchiato ! what the hey ? ? ? i 've never waited more than 5 minutes for a coffee at any starbucks location ! the coffee was good , but should never take that long to get . imagine if the order was wrong ? totally frustrating !	108
0	the food was ok , mussels were amazing and the premium nachos . overall good experience with friends but extremely bad service , i guess if we would have sat on the main floor then the service would have been better . had to wait 45mins for their speciality which is brewed beers to be served , no servers came to pick it up from the bar table until 15 mins has passed .	670
0	the property is nice ... but the service is very bad ... i stayed @ this location in the past ... will not go there again ... the front desk staff was the worst ... pretentious or even worse ... they definately need cultural diversity training ...	1859
0	as usual people try to shut you down and say things are not true because it puts them in a bad light . had i raved about their dealership , ms . aria would not have said my review was false . sadly , my review is unfortunately true . do n't say i did n't warn you . they are terrible over there and only work hard to protect their own behinds . they are not interested in the consumer . only your money .	525
0	new , but disgusting . the seats are comfortable and luxurious -- - but the theatre was disgustingly dirty . the entire place is run by teenagers ... who spend more time gossiping and flirting with each other than actually doing their jobs . management seems a little clueless and confused ( but well dressed ) . seems like there is little oversight or actual management going on . explain to me why it takes 4 employees to get 1 bag of popcorn ?	564
0	thanks again enterprise , my wife really did n't need you to pick her up like promised ... she had no problem waking in the middle of the day , it was only 110 outside . at least the idiot behind the counter , gave us $ 10 off . terrible service ! ! ! ! will not use again	3024
0	the room was not stocked with blankets . called front desk and the lady would not accommodate me . she asked for me to walk across the bridge to get the blanket myself . i am a local and for the amount of money i paid for the suite you would think a blanket would n't be a problem . will never stay here again . the hotel staff i 've encountered today have been very rude .	3916
1	one of the only locations with available lock boxes , if anyone is in need . i was in search for a lock box and luckily this locations had available boxes . i was greeted promptly and was assisted w/in 20 minutes . the process was easy and they have a great , friendly staff !	2703
1	still amazing ! this is my go to place for the past 4 refills of shellac . i always take the risk of going in as a walkin ! but they 're pretty quick every time	819
0	the owner is great & always nice ... does a great job on my nails , however they get a 1 star because of one particular persons rudeness & horrible customer service every time i go in there ... had same experience tonight & no said nothing about it so i left & wo n't be going back ever	2892
0	first time visiting jazzy , cheesecake was okay , i would n't recommend pound cake was extremely dry ! very large menu to choice from .	3611
0	pretty disappointing sleep study . my wires were so tangled and tight i could n't turn over or comfortably sleep in any position . the bathroom was junky , the furniture had rips and tears , blankets and pillows were unacceptable . i almost walked out as soon as i got there .	610
1	my daughter loved her trial class and was sad when it was time to leave . there is a convenient viewing area where i can watch her participate with her class the entire time . the instructors are cute with the kids and carefully help them through the exercises .	1106
0	for it being such an upscale restaurant they sure have really bad service . we waited over an hour for our food . and we did n't even order anything complicated . would not return there	971
0	horrible with quotes on time . is n't the first time i have been left waiting and waiting . this is n't the drivers fault by any means . it is the dispatchers who cant seem to get their times right . it would be nice to keep your customer updated instead of waiting 20 minutes after the quote time to call and say they are on their way . such a shame that we are then stuck with such few choices for this service . not a fan !	3643
0	slow . very slow service . is a starbucks but does n't honor starbucks free drinks ( no signs either stating that )	3558
0	shortly before christmas , i went to great clips . it was about 5:00 at night . there were two women working and i asked for a wash and blow dry . there was only one other customer , a guy with super short hair . i was told that the boss does n't allow blow drying when there are only two people working in case they get crowded . what ? no kidding , there was only the guy and me . i said well what if i get a trim . i was told i could get a trim but they still would n't blow dry my hair after washing it . obviously , i left and wo n't be back .	3281
1	great beer ! mango beer was phenomenal . amazing building . great location downtown , great to see them contributing to bettering this area of downtown .	1707
0	we decided to try this place instead of our usual cupcake shoppe on yonge street . we tried the fall pumpkin cupcake with cream cheese icing which was ok . the cake part was moist , the icing did n't taste like much . we also tried the red velvet and cookie dough cupcake . the red velvet cupcake was tasteless and the cookie dough was not impressive either . i would definitely go elsewhere next time .	3539
1	this is our favorite y so far . location is convenient and the staffs are really helpful and kids friendly . my kids are into soccer , swim , basketball , and camp here . price are a little high for me being a single mother but everything else is great .	349
0	this place is a total waste of time every time you come in they find another reason to come up with some ridiculous new bill . nothing but a bunch of money grubbers .	609
1	great location , great store ! the only reason i took off a star was cause it took me the longest time to find someone who could help me . but once i did they were great ! very nice and helpful .	3943
1	yeah wait times suck sometimes but that 's because dr. garcia takes time with her patients and i could n't imagine taking my kids to anyone else . she has worked with us on my kids allergies , referred us to specialist when needed , and been awesome when our insurance was screwing up ! if your going to walk in , plan to wait . morning appointments are almost always quicker .	2461
0	over priced drinks and games . bartenders are rude and need to find a better job if they hate what they do . lol	2494
1	had a great time here on 3/19/11 ! ! met the nicest people . love that you can gamble in the lounge .	456
0	the menu looks somewhat interesting . i was craving noodles so i had the mabo nazu ramen which was not so great , the meat was a bit dry and the broth was wayyyy too salty . the portion was very generous though . although the servers were nice they were hard to get a hold of , i had to keep trying to wave down the waiters to take my order and to pay . overall , i have had better ramen in many other places . i may return to try some of their other dishes and review again in the future , but the ramen is a dud .	1582
0	are there any good stores here anymore ? i remember in high school this was the hangout place , but now it seems run down and very vacant . all the good stores are gone , i.e hobby bench and they 've put in a lot of cheap clothing stores . not a fan anymore , other than the costco i guess .	2815
1	this 5 star review is for the auto department . we walked in to kill time and decided to get an oil change because our car was due . i appreciate how the employees gave us an honest estimated wait time . the oil change was done within the estimated time given and the check out was fast and easy . employees friendly !	3825
0	i have had a lot of challenges with this practice and i should have looked at the reviews before selecting them . my daughter has been going here for 2 years and the only thing that has been consistent is the poor service , no followup from voicemail and emails left , billing errors , mistaken charges and non-existent personal accountability . this is the first poor review i have done but i hope that it either helps redemption psychiatry evaluate their shortcomings and strive to get better or inform others so they can make a smart decision when choosing a doctor . after a lot of frustration and second chances , i will be finding an alternate solution for her care .	1541
0	monkeys could do a better job . the staff do not think about what they are doing or what is important to the car , only follow a checklist	3092
0	really love chipotle and like it because it is fresh , generally a nice place and breaks the mold for fast food . this branch , though , is quite yucky . i 'd keep distance . i sat down and meat did n't taste as fresh . looked up and saw this disgusting ceiling . just not nice .	214
1	i love this show and his personal car/motorcycle collection was great to see . bought a shirt and yoga pants too with his emblem on them . got to talk to horny mike , what a nice guy .	2978
1	the pollo mole is well worth the trip out here . service friendly and quick , lots of my favorite dishes on the menu .	7
0	we love boba at fat straw and thought we 'd stop in to try this out . the workers were really nice and friendly , but the tea was nasty . it has a chemical taste , like the creamer is fake , and the tea was over brewed and had a bitter taste .	490
0	the really lamb moment you realize that going to golds gym stephanie is fun for zumba and classes or areas you do n't have touch the ground ... the entire gym needs a massive cleaning , severe care and cleaning needs to happen asap , to be brought back to life will only be a tremendous gift to this once super great place ... i am driving to big five to buy a medicine ball ... have you seen the medicine balls at golds ? golds gym is crying for a face lift ! great classes , the people seem to be friendly- this is not a post on friendly or nice , this is a post on cleanly , and health awareness .	3446
1	good convention center for large events . i came here twice once for ces and recently for playstation experience . the hallways are wide and the actual hall where the show floor is very roomy . its ventilated pretty well and the staff is friendly .	587
0	we live in the community and have gone here a few times . the menu is nothing to write home about , the food is mediocre , the service varies from a couple of amazing waitresses ( i 've never seen a waiter ) to more very unpleasant ones who make you feel like an imposition and after they deliver your food , which takes forever , they never come back . then , unless you 're lucky and got one of the few good servers , then you 'll have to hail your waitress for the check as if you were hailing a taxi during a rainstorm in nyc .	1243
0	shitcan ben r. he will only continue to screw-up , embarassing himself and his team in the process . he 's also , dare i say , overrated . the rooneys need to stop being so damn cheap and find a consistently good qb , one that has his head in the game , always plays at the height of his powers , not just when he feels like it , and is n't saddled with personal problems and emotional disorders . in other words , find a good qb who 's not the nfl 's equivalent of dubbya .	3306
1	rj and john provided excellent service at the front desk and then the bar . their drinks were amazing and they were both helpful and fun . their creative drinks made our work time at the bar fly by . they 've inspired me to create some fun drinks back home !	3522
1	i went with my mom last year and an amazing thing happened . i forgot how much i loved barry manilow ! we had a blast ! if you ever liked barry ... even if it 's been years ... just go ! we splurged for the 5th row seats . as stated here before ... not cheap but i looked up at the people in the balcony and they looked like they were having just as good a time . so really anywhere you sit is probably great . everybody gets a glowstick ( and optional feather boa ! ) upon entry . how fun ! ! !	570
1	i like it , shop here couple years already , service is not the best but not bad either , people usually willing to help to find the best , things they do n't so they say they do n't then find the answer for you which is the quality we need . vegetable are not very fresh here , sometimes they do have some special varieties that is hard to find . fair price , not big place but it gets to the point that you find most things you need . think the deli dept is getting better since the past year , overall , good	541
0	live bug in sauce i saw a bug crawling in green sauce which i already put it in my food . when i reported it to waiter there she just disappeared with the sauce . no one came to my table for 10 minutes and i had to call waiter to replace my food with bug infected food after 10 minutes . worst experience ever .	1497
0	sadly , this mcdonald 's makes a good case for why minimun wage should n't be raised . my boyfriend ordered a hamburger without pickels . when the cashier enter the order into the register , she put cheeseburger . my boyfriend caught it and said , `` no , a hamburger . '' the girl then proceeded to read our order back and read off a cheeseburger with no pickles . my boyfriend stopped her again and said , `` not a cheeseburger , a hamburger . '' guess what we got when we received our order ? a cheeseburger . also , we paid $ 18 for our meal and we could have gone somewhere better for a lot less .	504
0	just so you know the previous review is the salon manager . of course they are going to give this salon a good rating . you get what you pay for . this place is truly hit and miss on their haircuts . mine was uneven and i had to wait months for it to grow back . would not go here again .	2737
0	worst massage ever ! they were 5 minutes late and had me leave 5 minutes early ( sounds like less than an hour ) . then i asked for a deep tissue massage and they gave me a little dainty chick that could n't squash a grape in a fruit fight ! and then when it 's all done you get to head back to the lobby and get the biggest sales pitch of your life . news flash ... you can get $ 40 massage 's all day on groupon . there are better places you just have to look .	2252
1	starbucks at n. rainbow blvd . and 95/summerlin pkwy . offers convenience . drive-thru is helpful . i am still waiting for starbucks to incorporate additional organic and gluten-free ( gf ) menu items . i do appreciate the cage-free egg , the justin 's honey peanut butter , grapes , apple slices , cheddar cheese , salt and papper ( muesli bread comes with meal too ) in the protein box . come on starbucks , make a nationwide move to send a message to support a wide range of dietary needs . offer organic sunflower seed butter , organic fruit , gluten-free baked goods and breads . that could be a start , at least .	2849

1	bao is awesome and fun . always willing to work with what you want and has great suggestions !	3021
0	we hired them to clean our house before moving in . the house was empty and should have been so easy to clean . they did a horrible job ! all of the laced i was expecting to be cleaned were ignored . we were charged $ 375 and the house was just as dirty after they left . very disappointing , look elsewhere for a real cleaning service . this company cleaned less than what i can do on a daily basis by myself !	173
0	waited a super long time for pedi only to be refused service ! i had a tiny nick on my shin which was healed from shaving . owner or manager came over & said they could n't touch my legs because of it so was only going to get a polish change . then he said we can not touch your feet , only toes ... are you kidding me ? will never return !	3732
0	the food is excellent , but the service is terrible . i 've eaten breakfast here twice , and both times the service was just awful .	364
1	probably one of the best korean restaurant in the area . tucked west on finch , it 's always packed during dinner time and on weekends . biggity big portions !	1290
0	the front desk lady ana was very cold and impersonal and rude . that 's the last thing we want to deal with when we are sick and i left and went somewhere else .	2517
0	the food is good but service was unexpectedly slow on a sunday morning , a day where you would expect there to be more staff members to accommodate a larger breakfast demand . wait time was accurate and they offer text alert/mobile app reservations .	1258
1	very lovely place for breakfast . staff is quick and food is delicious . great place for kids and families . their smoothies are amazing and i highly recommend them . ca n't wrong here .	243
0	very bland and tasteless ! we requested spicy curry and we were brought some sliced peppers which is how you add heat . lamb was expensive , tasteless and cooked horribly . they were out of chai and dosa 's which is why we went there . tikka masala was made with coconut milk which made it sweet and no spice or heat to it . the taste was to appeal to westerners not true indian food . the vegetable pakora were outstanding which is the reason why i gave 2 stars . staff seemed uncomfortable and clueless about indian food . very overpriced	640
0	nothing spectacular . friendly service but mediocre pizza . generally without much taste . main ingredient is the dough as the extras you chose is so sparsely tossed you wo n't taste them . quite a disappointment .	282
1	i did not expect late jight pizza delivety to be this good . there pizza was very good . in fact it was bestndelivery i had in soring valley area in a wild . amazing white oizza and pep . thanks guys .	459
0	this place used to be good but after some people left service has gone down hill . sat there for 8 minutes and was not even acknowledged so we left . it 's very sad to see this place go down hill that i have enjoyed in the past .	408
1	really easy transaction . joe came out to my house with samples , measured the areas to be carpeted , and wrote up a contract that met my budget . he was very knowledgeable and accommodating . joe asked when i wanted the installation date set for and schedule me for the following week . he went out of his way to make sure i was happy .	3407
1	this place is so much fun . i 'd suggest going on a sunday right when they open . the lines start picking up around 4 pm .	3677
0	horrible customer service they do n't care about you only your money your gon na invest too much to have to go through this	3019
0	my husband went there the first time and received the most amazing cut . said he had n't been cut so nice since the war ... .at 25 a cut for a soldier i hope so . tonight he goes back and received the worst cut of his life ! ! ! ! ! to include me cutting his hair . it is so crooked and waive the pictures do n't show how awful it is . these people owe this man a free haircut or two just to fix this mess . save your money apparently they are no better than any other place .	1058
1	i love the mental health tech names mr.perez he has helped me in many ways i wish he was my family he is truly helpful and has guided me through	2068
1	went here for live music on wednesdays . the group was great and had a good atmosphere of people . if i could give the food and service more than 5 stars i would . i had the filet bites and they were worth the price ! so glad there is a place in my neighborhood where i can enjoy great food , great live music , and great service !	1529
1	the most amazing experience and concert of my life ! ! the show , the production , the music , the dances , and jlo was perfect ! ! she sang all her top hits , and she did a phenomenal job dancing and singing for almost two hours ! jennifer lopez knows what it means to be a performer and give a production . the lighting and the props were just out of this world . she is a real talent ! ! ! there are no words to describe how amazing of an experience it was to watch her live in the pit ! truly a memorable experience .	1771
0	peanut allergy alert : they use peanuts directly in the sauce/soup , and wo n't accommodate peanut allergies . while it does have an allergy alert in the menu , it does n't specify that it 's in the food . discovered this fact after i had already lined up with a friend , but clarified it with the wait staff so we could find somewhere else to eat .	790
1	i love this place i 've been living here since i 've moved down here last sept 2015 ! it 's quiet and very convenient for my commute to work !	3849
0	not a great experience . we ordered an appetizer that was not at all what we expected . fortunately they took it back .	50
1	discovered citizen arms when looking for an ffl for my online purchases . wow , what friendly people ! ! not the usual gun store commandos . eager to help , knowledgable and just great guys . i went in to pick up a purchase i 'd made online . unfortunately , the gun was of poor quality and i wanted to send it back . citizen arms sold me a much better quality gun for the same price and did my return for free ! i ca n't recommend citizen arms enough ! !	193
0	fun place for drinks , but do not go if you are hungry . only appetizers are available . great beer selection and the roof top is fun . if you are hungry , stay downstairs for the meatballs .	780
0	i bought new tires for two of my vehicles and figured i should get the alignment checked even though neither car was pulling or showing signs of needing an alignment . network automotive told me that both cars needed to be aligned . the first car now pulls to the right and the second car 's steering wheel ended up 30 degrees off center when driving straight . i brought the second car back in and they fixed the misaligned steering wheel , but i had to wait over 2.5 hours again , with no apology from network automotive for not getting it right the first time . i feel like i need to take both vehicles somewhere else now and pay for a proper alignment .	469
0	i hate to bring up a competitor in a review but this place just makes me long for a harkins . no sweet collector cups , no free popcorn shirts , a most often too dirty theater , underwhelming seats , kids everywhere , expensive tickets , no student discounts , i come here when i have to , that 's it .	2406
1	my fiancée and i went for her birthday but she got sick and was hospitalized so we were a day late for check in ! the night supervisor name heather provided excellent customer service and facilitated our getting re-booked through hotels.com even though her shift was over ! when she did leave she gave clear instructions to the night manger gladis who showed extreme patience in assisting us also we got checked in finally at last after arriving at 6 something i think but the staff made it happen and that 's what counts so excellent customer service heather & gladis	3091
1	my boyfriend and i have been here twice and the food is delicious ! the staff is friendly and both times our severs have been sweet and very professional ! very family oriented as well ! love it here !	192
1	stopped here for a quick bite after running errands . my daughter fell in love with their cupcakes , frosting overload , and a smoothie . i liked their iced coffee and bagel . very small but does its job . nice area to sit outside and people watch . close to the fountain to play in for the kiddos .	3072
0	so far i have waited in two different lines for 20 minutes trying to check out . first line the girl was stuck with a customer and no help . after 10 minutes she sends me over to another line , now i am sitting in that line waiting for her to finish customers . with companies struggling to keep their physical stores open , jcpenney is not going to last much longer .	1536
0	there are many many negative reviews not featured on yelps main page . i hope this one makes it on the main page . the people working here are very rude . they are n't friendly to costumers . i 've tried it 3 times and i never saw any of them even crack a smile in 3 visits . i wo n't be back after today . it was the final straw when they fought over who had to take me because i was the only costumer in there and none of them wanted to get up .	3369
1	i am very impressed with this office . everyone is extremely helpful and friendly . the doctor was very personable and explained everything clearly as he was doing it . this will be my eye place from now on . thanks	909
1	finally found a `` gluten free '' pizza that tastes `` fantastic . '' the owner and his staff were very welcoming and personable . they really know their stuff when it comes to gluten free . my husband and i visit las vegas quite often and have not been able to find a pizza restaurant that serves gluten free pizza that tastes this good ! ! ! ! we will definitely be repeat customers ! ! ! !	1371
1	i was driving home from work and the transmission was slipping , it died on atwood avenue just before 4 in a 4 o'clock no parking zone , up pulls a parking cop and behind her a tow truck from schmidt 's towing , i thought it 's only going to get worse . she said looks like your having a bad day ( no ticket ! ) schmidt 's towed me into a legal parking area around the block ( no charge ) investigated the problem , i needed a tow . who am i going to call yes schmidt 's towing , nice people nice price , nice day ! ! ! next review the transmission shop .	3643
0	went here for a friends birthday . sounded like a cool and interesting place . they had live music ( the chick sang really really nicely ) wasnt too crowed . the scene is hipster=no bueno cocktails were mediocre at best . i ordered an old fashion that came out tasting like a nigroni . the next cocktail was the boulevard ( ier ) . tasted like an old fashion with chocolate bitters ... meh ill check it out when the cocktail program has been revamped	1992
0	this place is terrible ! ! a total waste of money ! 45 $ and we wandered around looking at pits of legos ... .the line ups were outrageous and the rides were broken ! do n't take your kids here ! !	984
1	food and service were both good . i was surprised at their better-than-average chinese restaurant service . tea was refilled , and they were always quick when we needed service . we had hot and sour soup , sticky rice with pork floss and fried egg , xiao long bao , green onion pancake , shanghainesr noodles , and toffee banana for dessert . the soup and banana were definitely something worth re-ordering the next time . the pancake , sticky rice and xl bao were average . typical for a taiwanese/shanghai restaurant . overall , we were pleasantly surprised at the above average service , and the food was n't disappointing .	1123
1	this market is tops on my list . whenever i stop in las vegas we stop here . the prices on the fruits and vegetable is way cheaper than the local supermarkets . service is n't tops but it 's a easy trade for prices . the employees try to make you happy , which is good enough for me . the variety is remarkable . if your cooking an asian recipe , this has everything and some .	2670
0	although champaign surplus carries an excellent and diverse selection of sports and winter apparel , the people that work on the floor are neglecting of customers . they will either magically camouflage against the coats or buzz quickly past you , but they will avoid helping you . the person helping us disappeared and we had to sit and look for another person . ( weird loud alarm ) their store has a totally unnecessary , loud alarm that goes off if you inadvertently step into an invisible area 5 feet from a random door that faces the entrance . ( wtf ) ( racial discrimination ) if you do n't look like a typical person from champaign , expect to be closely followed .	2259
1	received a new phone for birthday and it was way over my head ! being a long time t-mobile customer i thought what better place to ask for help than their store . i was right ! i walked in and was pleasantly greeted by jessica lejarzar ( store assoc . ) she answered all my questions , installed the necessary sim card and had me back on the road in a matter of minutes . thank you jessica ! d , henderson customer	1169
1	absolutely fantastic service ! brought my purse here in the morning with a broken strap and they had it turned around in a few hours . i do n't remember the name of the man that assisted me , but he explained what he would be doing and showed me the exact thread he would be using on the repair . i will absolutely come here for any future needs .	2114
0	i love to try new restaurants . this one was sadly lacking . i order the rice and seafood dish . i was very disappointed . there was not much flavor and very fishy tasting and smelling . when i told the waiter i could not eat it and ask if i could get something else , he was not accommodating at all . he basically told me you ordered it , too bad , you have to eat it . about 10 minutes later he came back and said i could have a small dish of arroz con pollo . this restaurant is on my do not return list .	927
1	my husband and i would definitely recommend booking saiaf films for their wedding/celebration ! from the very beginning , saiaf and his team were great to work with and responsive . the day of the wedding , saiaf showed a genuine interest in ensuring that great moments were captured and that we were comfortable . we felt very reassured the day of , despite the bad weather . saiaf took wonderful photos and we are super excited to see the final product !	1852
1	amazing ! great baked goods made from such a great staff that goes above expectations . i needed a sugar free cake for a surprise birthday party that we were having while camping . they were willing to come in early so we could pick up our cake slightly early .	868
0	opted for the $ 20/3 day plan . i should have tried the $ 10/day to try them out . horrible response time and my connection dropped multiple tried . i made the mistake of `` living '' with the problem for 3 hours as i had to get some work done . i should have cancelled the service right away . called twice to their customer service folks ( who were nice at least ) to rectify the situation . now i will have to escalate with my credit card company to dispute the charges . i would recommend staying away from this service provider .	3459
0	sad sad day when there is no christmas in this store and it 's only 2 days after the holiday : ( what 's happened to this company ?	1907
1	we usually come in here for our meds . the pharmacy staff is amazing . they 're real nice , friendly , helpful and knowledgable . unfortunately as amazing as they are , they stopped taking the guy i married 's insurance so we 're probably going to go to coastco or walmart from now on . whomp , whomp , whomp .	3799
1	the food was delicious and came out super quick . we told our server that we were in a hurry and she rushed it for us . we had the buffalo cauliflower , olive and goat cheese app , pear cobb and peanut curry quinoa bowl . they were all delicious and we will definitely be back ! !	1458
1	the best donuts in vegas..last night i had their french crullers..and they were melt in your mouth..wow ! i got my donut fix !	614
0	you 're much better off with expedia ! received a `` free '' trip for 2 to any major u.s. destination of choice , picked boston , paid $ 300 in `` fees '' , and received terrible flights and a motel that was over an hour away from the airport . upgraded to better flights for an additional $ 215 because the original flights had two stops each way . renting a car was highly recommended and when i looked at how much that would cost , i would have to pay over $ 400 for that . it 's truly not worth it with this company ... looking forward to boston but will not work with casablanca express ever again .	1777
1	love this place . great , and fast service . personable yet professional staff . the guys who take care of the car after the wash are hilarious ! you also get what you pay for . i 've never had any issues at this place or with any of the staff .	3899
1	another great starbucks . thank goodness there are so many in las vegas and everywhere else . always consistent and a place i can count on . kind of makes me feel like home to get a starbucks and know i 'm getting something i 'll like .	683
0	el sábado fue el último día que voy a ese lugar donde estaban cobrando $ 10.. $ 5 se me hacían mucho esta ves solo entre xq traía amigos que vinieron de salt lake city utah . es ridículo que cobren para entrar . piraña , share o cualquier otro gay bar no cobran entrada y son mucho mejor lugares que este . por lo pronto no vuelvo a este lugar al menos que cambien esto .	2249
0	hello ! i wanted to adopt a dog i saw on their web site this morning ! we were planing to head over there first thing tomorrow , but all of a sudden , the dog disappeared . which would be fine if he got adopted . but not so much if he got euthanized , or was about to . i am still trying to get a link to their e-list so i could pull that dog off it . so far , no luck . why make it so hard to pull a dog off the e-list , you jerks ?	2689
0	i have gone to fresh cuts many times and i 've always had a great experience but i just when and pedro messes up very bad and made me bleed while doing the hard line and i specifically asked for a thin line and he gave made a thick line and it was n't even close . i have always been charged 15 and gave a $ 5 tip but this time a gave them 18 and the barber went chasing after me and said its 20 . i am never going back again !	3469
0	i was very happy when this starbuck 's opened . first major issue was w the pigeons - ehhh , that was bad ! ok , but that was not their fault . fast forward : the service is always blah . the baristas seem like its a burden to say hello or otherwise engage . i 've had managers at this location w the same crap-poor attitude . most time the beverage is made to order , but not always and the attitude is the same as the greeting . i prefer not to use this starbucks , but on occasion i still do . this location is in need of attention from the regional managers , if not corporate . get it together folks !	2206
0	came here on a saturday afternoon , chose it over the starbucks next door . the pastries in the display looked good , the seating was comfortable ... but ... the keylime cheesecake was extremely spongy ( not fresh ) , the oreo cupcake was only ok and the caesar salad had pieces of rotten lettuce , with not much of a flavor to the dressing at all . my black coffee was decent , but the folger 's i make at home is better . my wife 's mocha frap was insanely sweet and tasted like it was made from a mix , and was also served in a chipped plastic cup . now i know why people prefer starbucks !	2163
0	i have no idea how these people stay in business . if it were n't for the local hotels & drunks they 'd be out of business . we bought some funky-tastng pastries & fruit salad here & then attitude from the schlep working there . i do n't care what the 'best before ' date is , it 's off , buddy . taste it . over-priced groceries , bad lighting & i 'm pretty sure the other dude was n't wearing gloves while making 'subway ' sands . just a heads up .	1731
0	came here for nye , and probably the worst one i ever had . bartenders downstairs were slow and rude especially the skinny one , and there was at least three fights that broke out . complete dump , staff terribly rude . will never return .	677
0	we were there for about 5 minutes just to stall because we saw they had a two set of customers they walked right pasted us when they were done after the people left and not one person spoke they went outside smoking a cigarette having their conversations . even when we walked out they kept on . it was n't crowded at all only two chicks was there . the only guy that was there turn around on his computer . we went for a tat and piercings for my bday . especially my husband needs two cover ups and wants his whole back done ok we will go somewhere else .	3481
1	she 's amazing ... i 've been following her for over 7 years now since she started working at the galleria mall . highly recommend her for your beauty services ...	2062
0	went here for lunch with my partner . and were told booths are only for 4 or more guests . the restaurant was empty besides a few people , one was a couple sitting in a booth ... there were 8+ booths available at the time . we were seated at the bar which was uncomfortable so we walked out . lost a sale and further business for the dumbest reason .	393
1	delicious hot dogs and really great spot . love the menu & all of their options . free kids hot dog in the summer ! that 's a treat for parents so we can use that extra money for beer ! ; ) love the king of pops too & the staff here is very friendly .	58
