0	came in to grebe a sub on the ran , i stand next to the counter for 10 minuet and no one care about taking my order , i left the place a drove to jimmy johns , you guys have to work on your service	1494
1	good fresh food , great choice of bagels and sandwich ifillings	3372
0	wait times ... ... . ... .. wait times ... .. are you guys still waiting for my review ? well get used to waiting if you go to this place . simple burger combo will be 20 minutes . also the portion is kind of small and the extra charges are high . if you want ketchup you have to use a no name packet on the side . also to upgrade to a fanta bottle the size of a can you pay 1.50 on top of the combo price . as for the burger it 's whatever nothing special .	940
0	i can not speak to their repair work . their est on a $ 1200 lens was $ 500 . they suggested i send it to the manufacturer and i did . amazing that it turned out to be a free , under warranty repair . i could never trust cris to provide an honest quote ever again . i 'd always feel as though i over paid . beware .	633
1	tres bon poulet ... prix abordables et assez bonne quantit√© . un bon rapport ... profitez pour manger votre plat au parc mont royal qui est a 3 min a pied	1109
1	well its walmart , lol . same as every other walmart . i 'm just glad it 's close ! sometimes they do n't have what i 'm looking for but most of the time they do . i do n't like that they move things every other day and i have to walk the whole store to find what i need . i have health problems and it 's very painful to walk so this creates a problem for me ! ! !	2141
1	the strawberry fro-yo was the best i 've ever had in a long time ! i also loved the location .	1184
1	dr edwards is incredible . she was amazing when my son 's puppy contracted parvo . she taught us how to care for the puppy when he was not staying at the hospital and he has made a full recovery . the entire staff was caring and very focused on keeping the little guy alive . plus , they helped us to find ways to cut the costs associated with the care . thank you ! ! !	2453
1	i have n't ordered much from their menu , but their chicken fingers and wings are delicious . i ca n't really speak for anything else , but i have ordered from here twice and i will continue to order from here again . i 'm also a huge condiments person so what really sold me was their ranch . order a full size and you wo n't regret it . i have only ordered delivery so i 'm not sure how the service is inside their restaurant , but the person who delivers is always quick and friendly . only bit of disappointment is that their delivery charge is $ 5 . i can live with that though .	1399
0	great selection , but i 've been in this store for over twenty minutes now with my sister and have yet to be acknowledged .	1920
0	survival of thie fittest stays true again today . order a bottomless fries and a water and just stare at the girls for an hour . 2 bucks .	75
0	the receptionist is awful . she crossed her arms and zoned out when talking . she did n't offer any instructions and said only that it was a two hour wait . we walked out .	770
0	made an appointment for monday at their ray road location , even got a courteous reminder call on saturday . but when i arrived on time , i was informed that the doctor does not see patients at this location on mondays ! then why make the appointment ? ? ? the receptionist just shrugged . i declined her offer to make another appointment and will find a different podiatrist .	1977
1	j . lo is awesome ! ! ! she put on an excellent show . fabulous costumes and great dancing . so entertaining ! ! i will recommend this show to any and everyone ! !	1771
1	i avoided seeing a doctor because i did n't want surgery . dr kastrup did my hip surgery and all i can say is good things about him . he prepared me for what to expect , the surgery was easier than i was expecting and i was amazed at my progress . the office always seems busy but i blame that on them being good at what they do and the state of our overburdened healthcare system . my wife has seen dr song for several different problems , most recently a fractured humerus and while paperwork seems to lag behind , treatment does n't .	2176
0	do n't go there for a flu shot . slow and incompetent staff . made to wait , told to come back , made to wait again , not able to process cigna . left without getting a flu shot . total garbage..	3044
1	first night in las vegas and picked this place randomly . excellent tacos . carne asada is bombtastic on anything .	857
1	i took my car here two days ago because the 1 year old battery kept dying , it would not start in the rain , and there was a funny sound that may have been the alternator . i figured this was going to cost me money . they worked hard to find my battery warranty as i did not have the receipt . no luck . but they replaced it anyway . i guess i seem honest . after the battery was replaced , they said that there were no more problems showing up on the diagnostics . and so far , i have not had any problems . it cost me nothing . nice and polite . that deserves 5 stars .	3020
1	landmark . this is where i have created some of my favourite memories . it 's only improving as well with their features and facilities and screens getting better all the time . it 's inexpensive as you get two movies for the price of one at a cineplex and we are all super privileged to be in an area with this kind of thing still available . also the staff are helpful if you ever need anything related to your car .	1634
0	i agree with the reviewer above . do not rent from steve or the biltmore group . very unethical . i had exactly the same experience . i could never reach him , he was unresponsive or constantly 'out of town ' . you have to be aggressive with him or you would never hear back from him . if you provide a security deposit , do n't expect to see any of your money back , regardless of how clean you left the place . you have been warned .	3723
1	first time we stayed at this best western . we loved it . the employees went over and above to make sure that our stay was a good one . the hotel was clean and the location was outstanding . we unfortunately left an article of clothing in our room and thanks to kaityn and sam it was sent back to us immediately . the staff was great and we have now found our new place to stay when in phoenix .	1195
1	i made an appt thru their website . they had a automatic chat when looking at the pricing . i thought that was awesome on it 's own . i asked for a female cut and was in the chair 2 1/2 hours later with no wait when i arrived . i was extremely tired ( i 'm sure they could see that ) and was offered coffee . i declined bc i wanted to sleep afterwards . my stylist was casee and she was a sweetheart . she knew i was extremely unhappy with my hair when i arrived . we did the normal wash and blow dry . but she knew exactly what i wanted . i will be back for my upkeeps .	1617
0	sloppy job & the nail tech used a lotion on me without allowing me to read the ingredients , even though i explicitly asked since i have a severe nut allergy . ridiculously overpriced at $ 37 for a gel manicure . tools were also dirty . would not return .	1796
0	very disappointed at the delivery install team 's lack of quality to hide a mistake driving a screw through both the tabletop and shelf without notice before they left . moreover , disappointed with customer service making us wait another 4 wks before a technician can come over to confirm the table is damaged . if this is what i have to look forward to , guess i have to not shop at ashley 's furniture again . too bad , so sad !	3738
1	fun small bar . great bartenders ! ! fun crowd . st. pats day and pretty busy ! mixed crowd . good music nice drinks ! ! !	245
0	this place is nothing but express . waited 20 minutes for two chicken kebab sandwich for take out , and i was the only customer during dinner service . the sandwich was extremely bland , with barely any seasoning , or lack thereof . one more thing , the guy who was preparing my sandwich did not wash the lettuce i saw him chopped and he did not wash his hands after handling raw meat either . i wo n't go as far as recommending mcdonald 's instead of this place , but subway is definitely a wiser choice .	1275
0	after procrastinating for a while , we finally decided to see the jlo all i have show at ph vegas . tickets costs us almost $ 500/- which was a total waste of our money . the audience was rowdy and we believe this is mainly due to jlo encouraging the rowdiness in the crowd . except for one or two songs specially the one she dedicated to her kids the others were really of poor taste - she is not a great entertainer , we have seen many other artists and have enjoyed them very much but this was a disappointment .	1771
1	i have been going here for years and have had wonderful service ! ! they have awesome staff and if i need anything extra like alterations or an item to be steamed i know i can count of them to help ! ! big thanks to jarely , for always having a smile and being helpful ! ! highly recommend this cleaner ! !	1719
1	the avocado toast and mochaccino coffee we go here often on sundays before we grocery shop at whole foods ! i also read they have bottomless mimosas for brunch but i have yet to take advantage of that ! ! i do love the setup of the place , it 's beautiful and has great color tones , brightness , plants , and seating options ! it 's a great place for dinner , lunch or brunch !	1331
0	do not buy from this guys ! i got a text confirmation saying the meeting place was carlos n charlies from 9:30 pm to 10:20 pm , i got there at 10:10 and the host says , oh you are late , you cant go anymore , im like wtf ? as im arguing with the host , a party of 4 arrives and they are allowed to get in ! why them and not us ? we got there earlier than the other party ! ! ! !	2122
1	the montreal location is far better than the toronto or chicago location ! absolutely delicious . perfect place to come for a fast and hearty breakfast wfh healthy options . quality is 5 stars .	243
1	this place has such farm fresh choices and a rotating menu . their salads and bowls are delicious and flavorful . i have n't tried the burgers yet but they look good too .	1269
0	this restaurant is unbelievable garbage ! will never enter again ! some seafood is not fresh , soup is too salty . and the delivery is way too slow . never come ! and no refund !	1016
1	been taking cars here to get fixed for years , and they never disappoint me . just had two cars there last month and now both cars look awesome . thank you bumpermedic ! ! !	2537
1	if you are looking for used men 's and women 's rolex watches , this is the place to go . they know their rollies and seem to always have a nice collection of used watches .	2923
0	way way way over priced . quoted $ 55,000 for installation of 2 lennox ac units . no , that 's not a typo . were not prepared to break down the cost of parts vs labor , i wonder why ? ; - )	1718
1	such friendly staff and doctors ! i hate doctor 's offices , but this one had a warm , welcoming energy or maybe it was the friendly smiling staff . i would recommend this office to anyone ! particularly dr fauer and dr taylor !	938
1	i have been shopping for a louis vuitton purse for a while . i stopped in last saturday and stacy immediately greeted me with a smile . i was n't sure of the exact purse that i wanted . stacy took her time and really listened when i explained what i was looking for . she found me the perfect one . i emailed her yesterday to see if they had the cufflinks that i wanted to get my husband for his birthday . she immediately responded and put them aside for me . i ca n't say enough good things about stacy and everyone at this location .	1493
1	opening day is alway confusing for most businesses , but la madeleine was pretty good ( for the most part ) . i ordered their c√°fe sampler ( quiche , salad and soup ) to go , and to my surprise it was bogo . nice start ! for myself i tried their french dip and because tomorrow is ash wednesday , ahhhh valentines day , i order a dark chocolate heart ( photo ) shaped cake for the boss . everything was very tasty and only ran me $ 32.60 after the discount . even better , la madeleine 's is near my office , so i 'll be back real soon .	1276
1	el serbicio es excelente muy amable la se√±orita q me atendio . gracias la se√±orita q me atendi√≥ es martha castel	1237
1	excellent special pho . have had it many times here . get it to go on a cold winter night . call in ordering fast and problem free . friendly employees . they have 10 min parking in front for pickup but sometimes people use them for long term parking .	172
0	liked the atmosphere but our food took way too long ( 1 hour ) . we had to pause in between because we finished the first few dishes .	1359
0	out of business ... though they have no problem charging your credit card if you had a pass . fortunately , i contacted my cc company immediately to make certain they ca n't keep charging me after reading the horrible reviews of management .	2044
1	quickest and least painful brazilian wax i 've ever received . will definitely go back for same service . owner was very friendly	3079
1	they did a great job in labor and work on the vehicle . although it was a fight to get a manufacture part instead of an aftermarket part purchased and installed . i do n't entirely blame invision auto body service but being a state farm approved service center , more communication and better understanding of the vehicle they were servicing should had been done . overall , the communication aligned and the service resulted to 4-stars .	2680
0	went to the thai house tonight and ended up walking out . we have been going here for a long time and the food has hit an all time low . we both ordered pad thai and it tasted like they used bar b que sauce in it . it was n't even close to the thai food that we have enjoyed over the years . i hate to say this but do n't think that we will be going back anytime soon .	895
1	we enjoyed a great lunch here sunday afternoon . small side salads were huge ! ordered a large half sausage half gotham . it was great and massive . the sausage was fresh and of good quality . the bread is the key . out of everything we enjoyed i would say the warm fresh bread and butter was a treat . was baked to perfection . our server and the rest of the waitstaff did a really great attentive job .	192
0	decided to give it a shot seeing as it is close to campus . bad idea . grease , grease , and more grease . i could n't even stomach taking more than a couple bites . upside : the guacamole and chips are pretty good . i 'd take a pass on this location at least .	1365
0	called the 1-800 number and they refused to give pricing . i know they need to have a consultation to get exact pricing , but seriously- you ca n't give me a range of fees ? ? ! ! after much back and forth , she could only tell me 1-4 thousand range . give me a break ! then , 2 hours after calling them , looks like my phone number was sold to telemarketing for some hotel vacation scam . what a bunch of crooks to do that . there 's nothing i hate worse than my info being sold .	3417
0	complete lack of customer service . i came in 20 minutes before closing to get a quick pair of glasses before the new year . with 5 minutes i had narrowed it down between 2 $ 320 - $ 350 glasses and the manager told me she would pull up my information to ring me out tomorrow . mind you they still have 15 minutes before the store closes . this is the place for you if you like lazy associates that do n't care about making a sale .	3945
1	great place to get your nails done . everyone is so nice , and the actual place is wonderful . only $ 9 for a polish change , but you can not tip on your card : (	43
1	went to aaa for travel assistance . spent time with jessica oergel who was incredibly patient , knowledgable and helpful . got our long weekend planed and everything was great . by the way jessica did her job you can tell she really enjoys what she is doing .	359
1	we 've taken lots of stuff for repairs here the lady was very kind , honest and helpful and she was able to repair a cherished teddy bear of mine that my dog chewed the head off of it looks brand new and i ca n't thank her enough .	2702
0	everything is sooooo expensive ! for these prices , we should have just gone to restoration hardware . amidst their vast inventory , there are only a very small amount of items i would consider putting in my home . i 'm really curious to know who buys these very expensive ( but very dated ) pieces . i should have trusted the reviews and saved the drive time .	1987
0	if i could give negative ten i would . first the salesperson was very pushy she would not let us walk past after we said no five times . we fell for it and she dodnt let us see the after pics just rushed us out after trying to sell us more stuff . our teeth look worse than they did to start with and they are painful . there is spots that she assured us would go away . they never did . dont get scammed by this dishonest business..we threw 150 $ away that could have been used on our vacation .	2667
0	sammy 's is usually a reliable standby , but avoid this location ! the service started out fine , but then fell off a steep cliff . the food orders were wrong for our entire table , so there was big disconnect with the kitchen . they were terribly under-staffed which contributed to the chaos .	1116
0	the worst customer service i have witnessed in my entire life . the lady who does eyebrows here is rude beyond belief ! i heard similar things from my friends but gave her the benefit of doubt . i would never return to this place again and will never recommend this to any of my friends ever !	1383
1	every time the food has been great . i love the grinder sandwich with loaded fries . not a big fan of walking all the way up to the bar to grab take out .	428
0	the owner may be excellent at what he does , but his customer service skills are horrendous ! i went in to purchase a vacuum cleaner belt , no big deal . but when i took the belt home , my husband could not get it on despite his best efforts . i went back to the shop , thinking he may have given me the wrong one . he actually yelled at me for bothering him about such a trivial thing and said i could bring the vacuum in and he would show me how it 's done ... . '' but i will charge you for it ! '' he takes it to the next level ! : - (	932
0	when on a wednesday at 6:28pm your delivery time is and i quote `` over 2 hours '' you should no longer state you have such service . that 's just ridiculous , called rosatis right down the street and they said a respectable 45 minutes .	1399
0	i brought my 11 month old here for some labs . i was expecting a couple pricks on his fingers or feet . instead they put a needle in his arm . maybe that 's the way it needed to be done . but i 'm giving them 2 stars because she stuck the needle in and dug around looking for a vein in his little arm . then instead of putting a wrap on his arm she put the tape . which is the hardest to get off . a bandaid would have been better on the positive side we did n't have to wait long to be seen .	2195
1	went to this restaurant for a business dinner . great decor , good mix of tables , hightops , booths , and long bar tables . great wait staff and ours took care of our large group with a high degree of efficiency . good beer selection . i will stop by the next time i am in the gta .	756
0	we stopped by this restaurant for a quick lunch . the atmosphere was very casual and the service was very fast . i was excited to finally try this place because i had heard so many good things . we ordered the takoyaki and the black ramen . i was so disappointed when our food came and the ramen was salty and bland . the takoyaki was decent but nothing special .	131
1	i really enjoyed living in these apartments . the area is safe and the apartments are clean and spacious . i have n't had any noise issues since living here and parking has always been available when my guests come to visit . the price is comparable with the area . in addition , desert breeze park & community center is within walking distance , which is great if you have children or dogs that you need to take to the dog park . i would recommend this complex and have recommended this complex to my family and friends .	2033
1	anthony resolved my refund issue to my satisfaction and beyond . had a great first session and will be back !	3048
0	being a transplant from la i always supported the local farmers market and such , however since moving to charlotte 'mecklenburg ' have lost faith in this city . let 's just start off being positive.. hmmm.. ... . hmmm.. the baguette spot they got in the corner of the market was alright . with that said . let 's talk about how this place can improve . # 1 the parking lot is crap- pothole city . # 2 the market freshness of the foods i 's crap , everything i 'd either frozen or dead . on a good note , , i enjoyed the box of ramen noodles i purchased from this place . edible and can last a whole good month..	1963
0	nightmare . takes forever to get your items.back . very rude . substandard work . do yourself a favor and go elsewhere	2702
1	another excellent service appointment thanks to brittaney & charlie . they always go above and beyond to take care of my bmw x6 whenever it is in their care . i really appreciated the brand new 2017 x5 that was my loaner for the weekend . my wife to be loved it . we will be considering one when she is in the market for a new car .	1752
0	left off a piece of mail for po pick up on a monday . by saturday the mail had not reached its destination . fort mill po mailman delivers mail all over the place ... we wind up running to neighbors exchanging mail . call the fmpo and they are n't interested . today i got someone persvription meds . i finally got a supervisor who was at least mad enough to want to get to the bottom of it . amazon prime two day means nothing in sc .	329
1	i came here when i got a flat tire . tim was excellent and got me back on the road in about an hour ! ! ! i do n't live in gilbert but happened to be in this area , is recommend this place	2146
1	kyle and mika are awesome the best customer service ! ! ! ! i wo n't go anywhere else ... if you want to be treated good , come see them ! ! ! !	2355
0	just finished watching ant-man and the wasp and it was disappointing today the least . the horrible recliners that would squeak oh so loud was n't what made this a one star for me , it was the fact that the lights continued to stay on throughout the first 30 min of the movie.. we are n't talking about nice low lights , but bright daylight white light right on you as you are squinting to watch the movie . definitely a no go for the future .	491
0	hmm ... lots of stars from fellow yelpers . which means i need to write a review of this place . my husband and i had our taxes done here last year ( for 2014 ) . i was thrilled to be getting a return , and my husband as well . unfortunately , canada revenue had to adjust both my file and my husband 's due to errors made by our accountant at triple m. service time was average . i just think , that regardless of how much you pay for taxes to be completed , the finished product should be accurate . accuracy is one of the best measures of professionalism .	3146
1	if their coffee was as wonderful as their donuts , i 'd give them five stars for sure but i find their hot brew to be a disappointment every time .	3137
1	love this compounding pharmacy ! i went in to pick up a prescription and noticed they have numerous vitamins/books on different health concerns all grouped together . also to my surprise , they have an assortment of doterra oils . looking forward to going back to browse when i have a little more time .	1372
1	good selection of pho , vermicelli , and meat and rice dishes . meals from 7 to 12 dollars . pleasant and clean surroundings . cash only for the moment .	707
1	i got my iphone repaired at this place in mississauga called space electronics they fixed it within 30 mins . amazing service and the rest of the staff there was very professional and knowledgeable and knew what they were talking about . i have gone to other places where they did n't seem to know any answers to my questions ! if you want your phone done right and proper i recommend these guys ! great job and thanks again guys . eric peters from brampton .	1586
0	i gave this store two stars because the selection of items was not bad . we would have even purchased a dining set from them , except for my husband and i were ignored by all sales people in the floor with the exception of the salesperson in the mattress section and the greeter . the sales staff either walked right by us without checking in to see if we needed help or spent time telling each other what sounded like personal stories . we ended up left without buying anything and paid more at the lickng spaces store where we were treated with respect and professionalism . i am not recommending ashley 's to anyone i know . nice job turning away clients !	3738
1	easy communication- friendly service . dropped off truck at 0800 , was called at 1100 saying it was ready . we will definitely be back !	203
1	the food is great ! i 've ordered almost everything from gourmet gringos and would recommend anything from the tamales to the taco salad . my favorite items so far are the fish or shrimp tacos and the nachos .	65
1	got the chocolate raspberry , cheesecake cake , glazed , maple bacon , pistachio , and chocolate glazed donuts ! amaaazzinnngg ! definitely got me going back for more . the donut bread part itself is delicious and chewy . the flavors are tasty . absolutely loved the pistachio it was my favorite and the cheesecake was creamy and on point with a little crunch . the maple bacon melted in my mouth and the glazed was perfect ( especially warmed up ! ) . the place itself looks fun ! very big and open . i enjoyed the openness and it 's great for groups ! this girl has a big mouth for these bigmouth donuts !	1643
0	worst food ... i ordered squid balls , it was disgusting . my friends had the rice bowl with pork . they could n't finish it . popcorn was very salty ... i will not come back . great fun and friendly staff though but the meal was not edible .	344
1	my go to place for most of my gardening needs . employees are very nice and friendly here . they very helpful when it come to anything you need help with . selections are amazing ! so many different plants to choose from that i ca n't decide . keep an eye out for the $ 10 off $ 50 or more than usually comes in the weekly ad on the redplum	2039
0	awfull service..do n't go here ... the guy kept my coupon to give me a discount on my smog check , and when the car failed its smog bec i just had the battery jumped , refused to give it back and charged me $ 10 for failing and no free retest..do not go here unless you want to lose your money and fail your smog .	2208
1	not a bad lunch place . pita was filling and the soda machine has tons of options . i would go again .	84
0	very disappointed to sit there for 20 minutes for only to have the female barber to ask if i had an appointment and complain about having 22 other appointments . very unprofessional on her behalf ! i will not go back nor recommend them !	2465
1	i was in a rush to catch the beginning of annabelle last week . incredible customer service . there were two guys at the counter selling tix and food..i they both worked together to make sure i got my food and made the movie on time . great service ! thanks ! !	491
0	i bought 10-12 steaks hard and grizzely ; it was a special event/ holiday -- ruined our meal . i went back two owners and butcher made me feel like scam artist taking advantage of them . i brought back the meat , very little was eaten ; they 're mouth dropped ; finally gave me my money back ; any other reputable store would not make their customer feel like a criminal like they did- i now buy as little if anything there . if you have a bad product its your fault not theirs unreal ! ! !	473
1	i 'm a fan of this store because of the two lovely ladies at the cashier , who are always cheerful and friendly no matter what time of day . watch out for them , their out-going personality is extremely contagious !	1856
1	the staff here are always friendly , and i have no complaints about the yummy drinks they make for me ! i like to come here and sit outside with my dogs . : )	2242
0	second time here -- second time with a huge wait for the food . kicking myself for forgetting ... do not come here unless you 're job or you have unlimited time to waste .	742
0	worst place in the world . terrible customer service . the front desk ladies are rude and angry . i will never stay here again . it 's disgusting and they promised me a princess suite and i got one of the worst rooms and said that hey are over booked which makes absolutely no sense if i already booked a princess suite . disgusting .	2973
1	first time here and glad to have a new hangout ! ! ! beautiful interior . great food . and our server gabby was the most friendly gracious person ever . we will definitely be back . avocado toast is off the charts .	1331
1	i did my vampire treatment with symmetry spa , it was amazing i saw the result with in 2 to 3 weeks , and no pain at all . i 'm so happy with the result now i do n't have to worry about wearing makeup everyday . the new staff are amazing , and specially catina she has a beautiful personality . thank you so much	306
0	sales dept invited us in for an early trade in . we discussed our requirements on the phone ahead of time . we were told 'no problem ' only to find out they could n't accommodate . complete waste of time . the service department is the worst . multiple visits to fix a problem not spotted . another time they were n't prepared with part as advised in advance . had to come back . again , waste of time . will not be renewing lease .	3940
0	very poor customer service . we had to leave because we felt like our business was not needed . the cashier , hannah , made us feel unimportant and was not very knowledgeable about the products they carry . she was not even willing to do the basic requirements of good customer service . we 'll take our business somewhere else .	99
1	great meal ! i do n't have too many pictures as we were too busy enjoying the food . wonderful service and food . i am always looking for places that have great salads ( hard to find ) and has options for days i need vegetarian options . aladdins is a great option for both . if you go try the hummus - with hot sauce and veggies .	1088
1	i actually do like their food here ! it 's a spacious place and to bring friends for some bowling and food . it a more sophisticated feel to a usual bowling alley , which i like .	742
0	i 've done my nails at multiple places but i hate to say that this place is the worse one i 've gone to . the lady unevenly coated my nails . a few hours after i got them done , my nail chipped off because she filed that nail thin . 3 days later and i 'm disappointed again because the gel chipped off another nail ! i have never ever had these experiences from other nail salons . im not one to wrote bad reviews , but i am just so disappointed	1272
0	we came into the store to find my best friend a dress . it was the worst customer service i 've ever experienced at a bridal boutique . if you do decide to come here , i highly recommend requesting a consultant other than dorthy , she was rude , unhelpful , and completely ruined my friend 's dress buying experience . we could n't run out of there fast enough .	2938
0	i randomly stumbled upon this car wash that was n't far from home . th outside of my car looked clean but once i drove off i realized that the car did not look vacuumed at all and in the backseat still had splashed soda on it . the whole inside looks like it was not cleaned at all and i paid extra to make sure that was cleaned that was the whole purpose of getting a car wash . i also tipped them . i have a baby so my time is valuable biggest waste of time and money if you ask me . i will never go back again !	88
0	you think $ 30 for a ride wristband is n't too bad until , but then they have restrictions on the rides and the entire area is excluded . they fail to mention this when you 're buying the band	759
1	these cakes are hands down the best cakes i have ever had ! so moist and so good . i will be coming here for all my cake needs . i would highly recommend to everyone !	18
0	i called three days ago and placed an order for a dress to be picked up in the las vegas store on 5/17 . today i found out that as of yesterday this store is permanently closed . very suspicious and sketchy they closed with no notice overnight , and not even the phone rep employees knew they were shutting down .	2153
0	the food is great but i waited 25 minutes for my food . unfortunately since we paid upfront we had to wait , it would have been more of a fiasco to ask for a refund . if i was at a family restaurant and waited that long i 'd simply leave but i 've never waited 25 minutes for my food .	964
0	had a terrible experience here . they forgot half the orders at our table and we waited for 40 minutes . worst of all , the employee and someone who looked to be a manager working did n't even propose to put a portion of the meal on the house . i did n't say anything , but just very bad etiquette , a restaurant should take responsibility for mistakes if they want return business . oh , and the italian calzone was terrible with hardly any meat and all peppers .	1307
1	awesome place . lots of exhibits , awesome robot exhibit , amazing sub exhibit , cheap food , but expensive tickets	1924
0	they are trying hard and very nice but the food simply was not that good . we tried the scallop appetizer , very odd vanilla flavor and small portion , and then the shrimp tacos again only 2 small shrimp per taco and lacking flavor . i would have liked to give a better review and would try again if i see reviews where the food has improved but until then staying away .	1253
0	i 've had good experiences with this salon and the prices are n't bad and if you pay in cash they do n't charge tax . but the front male manager is horrible . completely does not understand the concept of time management . do n't even bother making an appointment because they do n't care . he will tell you 5 minutes but you 'll be waiting more than half an hour because he simply does n't want to turn down a client . some ladies are nice whereas others are rude and just want a tip . my pedicure lasted 20 minutes ! ! ! ! definitely would not recommend though .	3592
1	what a great store and amazing staff ! i tried on a dress and she brought in 2 others of a similar style which i ended up leaving with ! i 've been in several times but this was my first time buying something ! totally love this store and what a cute boutique !	1880
1	this place is good to come by and hit a couple balls in the batting cages . $ 2 = 1 token . 1 token = 14 pitches . go karts are adult fun size fun , fast good track . they do have a wall to mountain climb . great place to kill time on boring friday nights .	3555
0	terrible service . after they were 40 minutes late for my appointment , they told me i would be after an appointment that had just started .	1817
1	great food ... loved the chicken curry . although relatively low on spices to tone it down a little , it had all the flavors that i would get back in india . was completely surprised with the belly dance . was pretty neat and a nice show . overall excellent food and really close to authentic . would love to come back !	1497
1	i was there for dinner with a good friend who is used to eat sushi and we had some really marvelous sushi 's and other things there . very good food for fair prices ! highly recommended !	745
1	i 've been going to lvac for over two and a half years - this time ! they have so many class options and i love the zumba ! i imagine the rest of the gym is nice too , i do n't use it much but it 's there if i ever need it . everyone who works here is friendly and nice , and the place is always clean .	3268
0	the food had no flavor , i ordered the meat lovers skillet and was a bit disappointed , it was very bland . my drink tasted funny , again with no flavor . the waitress was very friendly which is why i 'm giving a 2 star review . the restaurant itself was very dark..	1319
1	the most amazing juice ever , the flavor is intense and i no longer choke after heavy hits like i do with other vapor . everyone in my office told me about this place and now i 'm hooked ! ! !	3351
1	very awesome . had so much fun and felt like a kid again . the guides really make this place enjoyable as they are so friendly and easy to talk to . i recommend this place to all my friends to try . most games were n't too difficult but still fun . once you settle down you realize how great the view are from up in the tree . especially in october . they say to bring a back pack for snacks and such but the parking lot is n't too far so you do n't have to lug around your backpack . make sure you 're rested before you go because it does get a little bit tiring .	1970
0	stopped by this place by chance , hoped for something good seeing the reviews , but it was the same old toronto mexican . tasted like cardboard with cheddar cheese on it . plastic bags of pre-shredded cheese , chicken was mucky and had no flavour .	834
1	after trying many places in henderson area . i finally found my favorite nail place that does good pedicure . the usual i get is the $ 20 express spa which i think is a good deal . place is clean and quick . highly recommended because it is clean . that 's my number 1 concern for nail places because i do not want to contract any athlete 's foot or hepatitis . cheers to this nail place .	1388
1	if i reviewed years ago would of five starred . one less for service . we had the bartender/waiter one night and he never came to table . that was while ago , last few times waitress just seemed stressed and talking crap for tips ... really , then improve your service . we go for all you can eat wings , do n't think we 're done after the first ten wings ! bring more drinks ... get better tip . i 've ordered drink and never got to table . still best wings around though ... bw3 is not as good !	1487
0	horrible experience . walked out after they quoted me 300.00 for cut and partial highlights . lady in front was back and forth on phone talking to owner about price . very unprofessional and expensive .	1617
1	2nd swing is great and the staff is extremely helpful and courteous . i brought in 3 wedges whose grips were probably worth more than the entire club at this point . i was offered a few bucks more , per wedge , than i was expecting . after finding a perfect replacement to complete my new set , i walked out having spent less money and less time than i figured i would . russell was extremely helpful and the entire experience exceeded my expectations . i will certainly be a repeat customer now .	1013
1	very few spinning classes in phoenix so limited of where you go . but as far as decent bikes , good instructors and great sound system , 360 will give you a workout , your legs moving and your heart beat way up . the yoga is in a separate part of the building and is very small space .	3477
0	they are very rude and not worthy to go to them , i want to replace my lens because it got scratches . the worker did n't smile or even said hi . and she told me the warranty does n't cover it and i have to pay almost $ 300 for a new lens . i knew that she is just rude and does n't want to work and it 's wasting time to tell her manger because they both are same . so i went to lakewood lenscrafters and the changed id on warranty for $ 24 .	3637
0	this probably the smallest and most uncomfortable airlines i have ever flown with . the prices are dirt cheap but you get what you pay for . they are usually delayed . when they 're not delayed they leave the port five minutes prior to take off time . they do not care about customer service but rather the money . if you can pay for another airline than do so but if you 're looking for a quick getaway with minimal cost book away .	3127
0	never go here . they gave me a horrible gel manicure that peeled in a week . when i went back to get it fixed , the woman raised her voice at me and accused me of peeling them off . so rude and unprofessional . not worth giving them your money .	132
1	acceptable wait times at the walk-in clinic . young dr. mohan upstairs is great . he 's my family doctor now .	592
0	did not acknowledge me when i walked into the shop , and took forever to take my order . when they finally took my order . the server order food with gloves at the register and went back into the kitchen and started preparing food . cross contamination and unacceptable for a restaurant . always wash your hands whenever you prepare food or taking order at the register	322
0	i am from chicago and was in champaign for the weekend . decided to take my brand new car with 6k miles in for an oil change . 25 miles later oil light comes in and there was zero oil in my car . had to call tow truck , spend another night in a hotel , and miss a day of work . are n't they in the business of oil changes ? they need to pay my expenses and pay for a new engine if i need one . horrible .	3376
1	angel and glen were fantastic ! ! ! helpful , professional , and just plain nice . my leather couch cushions look phenomenal ... and the price was very reasonable ( they told me about the recycled leather option which appealed to my `` earthy '' side as well as my pocketbook ! ) ... .thank you ! ! !	1174
1	visited this joint with a bunch of female friends . notable was the very sweet and accommodating hostess . we were served by three different bartenders and two were slightly rude but the third was very friendly . the drinks are delicious , large , and entertaining . the food is fine . obviously , this place is appealing for the atmosphere , and we had a great time despite the hit-or-miss staff . it 's likely that i 'll go back .	292
1	the staff here are very friendly and kind . both my cats , mewes & toast are seen here when they need their annual checkups , shots , or flea medication . the vets have always been extremely helpful and have always answered my questions with knowledgeable answers . highly recommend roncy village vets .	2487
0	: ( i used to be a regular at this particular location but their staff turn over has been high and the quality has gone downhill : (	3084
0	ok i like this place . i like their stuff . a little expensive but still great stuff . what pisses me off is their unprofessionalism . many many times i 've visited them in morning and they do n't open on time . i came back in 35 minutes and they had n't opened . many times during the day they have a `` be back in 25 minutes '' sign and they are never back in 25 minutes . it 's extremely annoying !	2905
0	the biggest joke on the strip . clown town agent at the book claimed they needed my `` card '' . went and got it and placed 2000 on an over 2nd half . counted the money any said confirmed the bet . then said wait a minute ... . came back 3 minutes later and changed a line from 21 to 21.5 second half . forget this bullshit operation . the supervisor is a joke bitch who ca n't answer any questions . just knock this place down . management is a joke .	2271
1	they are the management company for several of our homes and they are superb in customer service and maintenance issues. ! thank you apartment hunters	3451
0	i thought the place was nice enough as were the staff . but i came home with bed bug bites ! never had them before and they itch like crazy ! called the hotel to tell the manager but could not get to talk to him . left him a message about the bed bugs but he never called back . that told me more about the hotel than just the bites . it told me they do n't care about their clientele . he should have at least returned my call , asked some questions and apologized . bad business relations . and that yields zero return patronage , at least from me . i feel sorry for the good people employed by the organization .	2966
1	awesome place ! everyone is so nice and friendly . they like to joke around and have fun , which is great . quality is great and prices are very good . highly recommend .	457
0	took both my boys for simple hair cuts . ive driven by the spot a few times and decided to try them out . each boy went with a different stylist . the one lady was super quick and didnt clean him up or put talc to remove the cut hair off his neck . she didnt even style his hair with gel , she just basically did a poor job . as for my other boy , the lady that cut his hair was a bit more detailed , but she still managed to give the kid a crooked part line . looks more like a thunder bolt than a part line ! lol . with that said we probably wont be going there again .	33
0	i live in the hood and am also a small business owner . i pit an order in at noodlehead and wales over ... .i opened the door and was told , `` just so you know , we do close in 5 minutes . '' okay , so i left . how about , `` hey , are you looking for something ? '' or , god forbid , `` how can i help you ? '' would it be a big deal to stay 10 minutes late ? i hope the owners know how their store is run when they are not there .	3224
1	this is a review as a buyer- i went in for the first time last weekend and found a few great pieces in brands i love ... i was so happy i went back the next week and again found 2 items that were perfect . nicely curated store , good brands , nice staff . ( brands like zara and banana republic )	1762
1	i almost did n't come here because there were a lot of bad yelp reviews but , they were open late and i did n't want to go to the er instead . the lobby was clean and nice looking and the girl behind the desk was sweet . i was seen by dr. peter tretheway and his assistant nick . the dr. was so very kind and compassionate but super professional . i was out in 20 minutes and had everything i needed . he was also very non judge mental about no insurance and rearranged the medication plan to best suit my situation . i would certainly return if needed .	535
0	my eyes have been burning after getting eyelash extensions . the lashes fell out in chunks the very next day . theyve been uncomfortable all week and i have no idea what to do . i tried calling a few times and no answer ... i never got a call back .	3360
0	first timer and not very impressed . wanted to wash off the dust . i now have streaks of dirt down the sides . so it did n't clean it very well to leave dirt to dry down the sides from the drying . i 'll be finding a better car wash	2044
1	rooms were clean and big with refrigerator and microwave in every room . it was quiet , no crazy people around for a 3 star property/ $ 50 range hotel . the location is convenient to 3 awesome casinos . the pool looked nice and clean . breakfast is included with the night stay and it 's not bad- waffles and eggs , plus some yogurt and cereal options . staff was very friendly and went above and beyond to help me find various places in the area .	1888
1	i usually order all my hair care supplies online . however , i was all out and could n't wait for my mail order moisturizers . so of course i browsed yelp gathered my hubby and google maps and headed out to find this location . i 'm so glad we did ! they had everything i needed all very reasonably priced . they have hair care products , makeup , all types of scrunchies and kids hair accessories . the staff was friendly and helpful . they asked if i needed anything but did not hover . i will definitely return .	3676
0	strike 1 : bad iced tea . sent back . strike 2 : bug in my wife 's sandwich ( in the greens ) strike 3 : cold burger and chicken sandwich we 're out . avoid .	369
0	customer service is horrible ! we were the only ones that walked in the store and no hello no acknowledgement whatsoever . i proceeded toward the counter and said hello and the girl just looked up with no expression . so rude ! i would never step foot in that store again ! i wanted to buy a lot of stuff but i ca n't support a store with such poor customer service . looking at past reviews it looks likes nothings changed .	1933
0	u get a good cut but they have u sign in and never check the sign in sheet they pick and choose who is next i waited an hour after signing while others walked in and got cuts even if u make an appointment u will wait an extra 30 minutes if ur lucky . ..if u do n't have a life and have time to adjust to their schedule i guess it 's worth $ 20	3469
0	been going here for a while for the 1/2 price shakes . they are really good . sooo last night i decided to get a burger . big mistake . meat was overdone , way overdone . one bite almost choked me it was so dry .	844
1	i can not believe the fantastic service that rick and the team here extended to my family . no add ons , no hidden charges and extremely reasonable pricing . very friendly and accommodating people that understand the needs of a grieving family . the whole process was so efficient that my family went away with a great feeling that we made the correct decision to use bunkers services	3064
0	the first time i wanted to check out this club i looked at the crowd and they were all ghetto ! ! ! so we left . the second time.. the bouncer was on a power trip and expected us to pay cover plus tip ! we were 4 females ! what club charges for 4 girls to go in ? ! they have really bad customer service ! i 'm not even going to try a third time here . not worth it . and pleeeeease notice the date on all the positive comments for this club ! they happened in 2009 ! it 's so not like this anymore !	3596
1	this review is long over do , but christopher moving is the best . the movers showed up to our apartment 15 minutes early , they were very professional , and finished in two hours . they were fast and efficient . if i ever have to move again ; i will hire christopher moving again . just by far the best moving company here in vegas .	1645
0	horrible service . after being seated i waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged by the waitress . not even a water was offered , however she did have the time to get coffee and water for two tables that were seated after me . when i finally was acknowledged there was a slight attitude in her tone . i 'm done with this establishment .	1262
0	i was here in the holiday season when they did n't do guided tours but had docents placed throughout the house . i felt like they were too eager to interact with me , and it frustrated me after a while . even the docent/guards in the museum buildings were eager to strike up conversations . i 'm sure most people would find it pleasant , but i prefer to keep to myself in most museums , and it seemed like once i had gotten one docent off my back another was there . their enthusiasm was wonderful , but unfortunately for me it was not contagious .	3461
0	came here 3/16 and checked out the beta fish to find multiple fish dead in the containers , two chinchillas huddled together in a cage with no food , water or shelter , found hamsters in the same conditions as the chinchillas .	2649
0	not impressed . greek pita has better food with much better prices . ambiance is nice but food is meh . we ordered the kefta and chicken kabob plate . both plates came luke warm so we asked them to warm our food which they did . the sauce was just ok . overall . .we wo n't be coming back .	185
1	i 'm a loyal customer - i purchase an average of 4 frames from sassy every year ( have been a customer since they opened the 16th location ) . i sport two looks - a casual look and a professional look . sassy provides both . great range of frames , top quality lenses and superior service . there is nothing to not like about sassy glasses . dan and quida are wonderful to work with and most helpful .	3501
1	i was recently informed that the gnocchi is back on the menu . the last time i had it there it was amazing . it was the perfect texture , not mushy at all . paired with the mushroom alfredo sauce , it is delightful . i 'm glad stella 's brought the entrees back . we will be back soon , i love supporting small businesses that make quality food for everyone 's taste buds .	781
1	love sun nails ! been coming here for many many years . amazing staff , very accommodating , clean facility , newly renovated . i do n't go anywhere else because i dont get the same service elsewhere . definitely one of the busiest and best nail salon in scarborough !	3811
0	any bakery that is by appointment only should not have a huge marquee and have posted on there doors that it is appointment only . and then when you walk in look around confuse a man with a box of raw meat should n't treat you like a hobo looking for a place to squat	981
1	what a great experience ! bought my first car at a dealership thru these guys , made it extremely easy and helped me every step along the way ! they really went the extra mile to find me a good car and get me approved . the location is super clean have solid vehicles available . not pushy and in you 're face . they were straight up with me and made me feel informed . defiantly glad i went and checked them out	3305
1	gorgeous lady did a gorgeous job for eyelashes . originally i was a bit hesitant since there has been no reviews about eyelashes extension . the lady who did my eyelashes is very nice and efficient , and they turn our very well . thanks for the great service !	1051
0	jorge responded quickly when i initially reached out but once he found out it was n't going to be a $ 5000 job , all i needed was maintenance ( trim plants ) to start with , he stopped answering my calls and texts . i do not recommend . it 's getting really hard to find good workers	3727
0	first time here ... sooo rude ! ! went here for dinner and drinks . we open the door and this rude lady comes waving us and shooing us away yelling it was a private party ! how about put a sign on the door ! ! ! we have lots of friends and usually come in groups and spend . what the lady should have done was kindly tell us there was a private party in session and she appreciated us stopping by and to please return again . they have for ever lost me and anyone i know as a customer ! ! ! booo	710
0	cool looking place but about $ 25 for 2 chili dogs 2 fries and some sodas was wayyyyy tooo much money and while it was a cool looking place ... .i would not go back only because of the sky high prices .	953
1	i had dr shaba do a vasectomy and i could n't be happier ! him and his staff really made me feel comfortable before the procedure and it went better than i could have hoped for ! also , i have heard from several friends that their doctors made them feel bad for wanting to do a vasectomy and dr shaba was not like that at all . i would recommend dr shaba for anyone considering this procedure !	2777
0	still on my never ending quest for good chinese food in az i walked in this place . it smelled good so i thought why not . the lady who took my order was n't the friendliest but customer service is dead so ok . i ordered pork fried rice , chicken egg foo young , and orange chicken . i am not pleased . i don'tknow how they did it , the rice tasted burnt . the egg fooo young had big chunks of vegetables , too big , and was flavorless . i will say the orange chicken was meh ok at best . needless to say i will not be back . not good .	1459
0	first and last time going there . employees were n't friendly at all and acted like snobs . employees smelt like they had sour clothes on . girl with over stretched lobes issa wench .	2895
1	i had my eyebrows waxed and tinted by zara today and they look amazing ! all of the ladies were very nice and courteous . seva will definitely be my new spot for my brow styling and i look forward to trying the lashes next week and some of their other services as well . thanks ladies !	3614
1	this is not the place for wimpy car , people who do not like dust , or do not like to do a little manual labor . a nice rock yard that quickly weighs and loads your truck with rock and send you on your way . the selection is decent , i guess there could always be more , but thee stones they have work with the local environment . the y also deliver , but not sure of the minimum requirements . they have big dump trucks , i think they said 20 tons or so . that is a lot of rock .	3824
1	ca n't beat the game deal in the stadium . $ 25 for a large 1 topping and two drinks , with 1 free refill on each ! ! you wo n't eat better or cheaper anywhere else inside that park . pizza is huge and so good ! ! can not wait to try their other locations , because the listed menu is limited in the stadium . still they also have pizza by the slice , salads , hoagies , garlic knots ( which smelled delicious ) and beer specials . you can order ahead of time , and can use the entrance as a gate into the stadium . honestly such a great spot for families at the pirate game ! !	293
0	extremely disappointing sent 3 emails to the office and made calls to there office with no response back . i have a town home i was looking to rent it out but i guess there either to big or busy to respond to my enquire . i guess black and cherry property management will be managing my property .	32
1	good food , do n't know how it compares to the rest of its kind , since i 'm new here . we had pork sinigang w/sili , gabi , tomato & onion , lechon kawali , tortang talong , fried bulaklak . dessert was a little better : halo-halo , buko pandan & my fav . turon w/ube ice cream .	658
0	the potential is there ... they just have n't reached a high point , or middle point yet . it is a beautiful setting , as one would expect of a place boasting of ms. longoria 's name . but salt does not make a bad meal better . beso was the 180 degree opposite of blossom ( http : //www.yelp.com/biz/blossom-las-vegas # hrid : djkoxy3xgsgmjsi5lx6vbw ) in the aria in terms of flavor . the chefs should take turns at each other 's kitchens , and maybe sharing each other 's secrets would help the other out .	971
0	the stars are for friendly , helpful staff and the ultra comfy bed . other than that ... not so great . the bathroom is a conceptual disaster . the shower leaks everywhere . the sliding door looks cool , but provides no sound-proofing , so do n't share it with someone you do n't really love . and weird random housekeeping things happened during our three-night stay : glasses would be taken and not replaced , a rag was left in our room , and our big towels were taken but not replaced . and top it off with how difficult it is to alter a sale reservation ( company-wide problem , not location-specific ) made for a pretty frustrating stay .	2188
1	i have had great success with the products purchased from rc willey . i recommend the store	439
0	kathy is a horrible manager first off . her customer service is absolutely horrible . i had to look at my online order that was supposed to be ready 2 hours ago and told there 's nothing she could do . when i expressed my dismay with other customers we were told we could leave . my problem was rectified by another manager named dennis . dennis is the man and the only reason i will be back to this walmart . he greeted me and reasonably fixed my problem without the hostility kathy had .	2443
0	wow . i bought a non sale jacket on sunday , decided i did n't really like it and went to return with tags and receipt . who knew that they no longer refund your money ? ? ? i knew this about sales items but really ? ? ? that is the last $ 40.99 this shitty store will ever get from me . i was treated like i 'd done something wrong just because i did n't like the crappy quality jacket .	3373
0	i am so disappointed ! i stopped in yesterday to see if they had a boneless turkey breast . the guy behind the counter asked me to come back in 20 minutes and he would have it ready . i assumed it would be an unstuffed boneless turkey breast . when i returned i was pleasantly surprised when he said it was ready and at the cash . i bought it and cooked it tonight with all the thanksgiving trimmings . what he actually gave me was stuffed chicken breast ! what the hell ? ! ? ! i am so angry and will never shop there again . shady business !	3151
1	got a small chicken burrito bowl and small spicy pulled pork burrito . both were delicious but the pulled was definitely the winner ! the ingredients were very fresh , love that the guacamole is free and portions were very generous . but it took awhile after ordering to get our food .	31
0	the bagels are delicious but i 'm a bit concerned about the employees sanitation ignorance at this location . there was an employee handling cash at the register with gloves on & right after i ordered my bagels she went & grabbed the bagels without changing her gloves . i asked her politely to change her gloves & to please get me new bagels . she did it but had an attitude about it . not good..	477
1	had sushi here with a friend who came from ca and stayed at this casino . although sushi took some time to make , rolls came out super fresh and the service was excellent . cozy little place to eat at this casino . very satisfied .	1196
0	wait wait wait . car emissions is a scam just to collect additional money for the state . what ever you do do not go to the full service lane go thru the express lanes .	138
1	a big shout out to reina and lilly thank you so much for helping me pick not one but two really different cool sunglasses , all my friends here in nyc are completely jealous .	2386
0	food is spotty but service is good . kung pao was nice and spicy , on request . another time , the fried rice tasted funny . sad . they never seem to do much business , at least when i 'm there . i 've stopped patronizing this establishment , unfortunately , as the quality of food declined a little too much . also i noticed an unusual smell . not a nice thing to notice in an eating establishment .	1550
1	this is , by far the most amazing botanical gardens i have ever been to . the flowers are incredible , the landscapes are so complex and interesting , and the japanese garden is amazing in the fall with all of the lanterns . if you are planning a trip to montreal , make sure this is a stop on your way and hopefully you 'll be here in the fall for the lanterns . bringing a picnic lunch and a book to read can be the best decision of your vacation .	183
0	i hate to say this , but out of all of the cupcakeries i 've tried , cream & flutter is my least favorite . from frosting to cake ... very disappointing . maybe i should go for a cookie next time ?	3749
1	i had a great experience at red line ! customer service was great , i loved the comfortable feeling when i walked in . my cards were better then i had originally designed and were ready for pick up in no time ! i would recommend this company to anyone looking for a great printer . oh and thanx for the cookies red line ! !	1781
0	waited 15 minutes in the only area that had room to stand . no drinks . then finally a bartender/server comes over , ignores us , and served what seemed to be a regular behind us . very unprofessional . wo n't be back .	3846
0	i popped in for breakfast on a saturday . the atmosphere looked promising , and the service was excellent . sadly , the food was unappetizing . it is difficult to screw up a simple breakfast : scrambled eggs , toast , bacon , and potatoes . nothing tasted fresh , and the quality was equal to a diner two blocks away for half the price . it is unlikely i will eat here again .	1204
1	changing my 1 star review to a 4 star review ! service has improved , staff is delightful , and the kind notes on the cups are a nice touch . happy to see this place improving !	1761
1	we really enjoyed our romantic night out at bonterra . the roasted leek and parmesan dip was delicious ! my steak was well seasoned , served very hot and ended up dry and a bit overdone for being `` med-well '' . i was n't able to enjoy most of the steak but my french martini and appetizer were perfect .	886
0	sold me a supposedly fresh salmon belly last week but it 's rotten . very disappointed ! !	2670
0	very frustrated with jen sias and one of her employees . i know she no longer works there but step up and admit you guys dropped the ball . i have been with you for a long time , i wish there was value in that . you have now lost a customer	2675
1	i ca n't remember our salesperson 's name but she was very sweet and showed us almost every pair of sunglasses in the store until we found one my boyfriend liked . the location is a bit small but they have a good selection of different types of sunglasses .	2676
1	i got my id here when i returned to pa from out of state . i went on a weekday during the day . i did not have a long wait . the employee who assisted me was nice . my id unfortunately printed with a black dot on my photo -- right on my nose . it was not there in real life . just a printer malfunction .	2408
1	this place is amazing ! it was very clean and well decorated . there 's lots of space . i was very happy to see that all of my pedicure utensils came out of an autoclave bag ! they made sure to take their time on my manicure and pedicure . they currently are running 20 % off for all services . i did n't feel rushed and they did a wonderful job . i definitely will be back in the evening to make sure to have a glass of wine while i get my next pedi !	2977
0	they showed up 2 hours late . one guy went home sick in the middle of the move . what should have taken them 1.5 hours to load , they spent 4.5 hours . a lot of our furniture is dinged up . they showed up in a rented 14 foot budget truck for a 2 bedroom apartment . would not recommend .	2119
