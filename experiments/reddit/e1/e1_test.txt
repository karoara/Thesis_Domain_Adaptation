1	Are you saying Clinton is the decent candidate? Because I beg very much to differ.	3
1	Gay people don't get a choice about being gay. You do have a choice on whether you own a gun or not. Completely false equivalency.	3
1	I am Aussie. About 20 years ago we banned semi-autos, autos, brought in other controls, you need a gun safe bolted to the floor etc. Before this, we had a similar number of shootings, but since the controls, not one mass shooting. If you would give your vote to an Ayn Rand loving whack job who would love to sell the government to the highest bidder, over gun controls? You're as liberal as Rand Paul. Seriously, wtf?!?	3
1	Why, just why is this something Congress took the time to do.   Also if you're a woman and your rep voted for this they owe you some answers.	3
1	Probably to distract people from real issues.  The way I read this is "Rich white guys vote to take rights away from others in a bill going no where to appease the base."	3
1	As fantastic as this is, I am so disheartened to realize how small $1.5 million is when the Kochs/Adelsons will be donating $1-2 BILLION.	3
1	But their are millions of us. 5 dollars from all Bernie's supporters could change the game.	3
1	Even if every democrat that voted in 2012 gave Bernie $5, it would still only be 300 Million.   The winning candidate will spend over 1.5 billion in the next election	3
1	oh ISIS is laying low in El Paso?  no wonder i couldn't find them.  It's almost time for me to begin my shift at the majestic Anwar al-Awlaki Memorial Federal Slave Labor Camp #16 just outside of Dallas.  I'm a poker.   I get to poke the un-believers with a cattle prod.  We rounded up everyone who didn't vote for our Supreme King of Kings, Obama, and stuffed them all in underground black-ops Wal-Marts.     Texas, not even once.   Seriously, ya'll got some pretty stupid people over there, and i live in Louisiana, so that's saying something.	3
1	Oh good lawd amercy dat evil Obama's gon lock us up in dem walmarts!	3
1	&gt; "Your letter pandering to idiots ... has left me livid," former State Rep. Todd Smith wrote Gov. Abbott. "I am horrified that I have to choose between the possibility that my Governor actually believes this stuff and the possibility that my Governor doesn't have the backbone to stand up to those who do."  Rekt.	3
1	*Right now?*  Holy shit your state is on a historic stupid run that spans decades, generations even.   Perry, Bush, Abbott, even Ann Richards had her moments toward the end what with her backing of Big Tobacco and other insidious special interests. And those are just the Governors. Don't even get me going on the sinister psychopaths like DeLay and Gohmert.  Your state has gone so large with the stupid recently I have no choice but to stand up and salute it!	3
1	The liberal candidate for governor in the last election had 38% of the votes. That's pretty good for a red state.	3
1	Jesus christ these people are fucking nuts.	3
1	Is anyone besides me aware that Rafael Cruz (R-Canada) is a pandering jackass?	3
1	What I want to know is why U.S soldiers are training right here in the United States. I've never heard of a military base in the U.S., let alone soldiers "training" at one. And training in the Southwest? Who the hell's ever heard of a military conflict in the desert? And everyone knows if there's gonna be a rebellion here, it'll start in the middle of the desert where nobody lives.  /s, though not particularly far from what these nutcases really think.	3
1	.#WhatAboutBernie  Every time I hear talk or speculation about election 2016 or the candidates I am emailing the media agency and asking "What about Bernie?" He doesn't have the money or the lack of principles to be a lasting presence on corporate media, so we will have to force their hand.    .#WhatAboutBernie	3
1	Well I guess with Bernie we'll find out of it was the spam or the batshit insanity that turned people off Ron Paul.    Personally, it was the batshit insanity, bigotry, and shitty policies that turned me off.  The legion of Paulbots trying to spam and downvote anyone that pointed that crap out didn't help either.	3
1	Politifact: Our ruling  Huckabee said he "raised average family income by 50 percent" during his tenure as Arkansas governor.  Once you account for inflation, Huckabee is incorrect. Income in Arkansas increased 20 percent, not 50 percent. That increase trailed nationwide trends.   The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.	3
1	I knew some of those faces and no, they weren't happy. I also knew some folks that had HP stock. They weren't happy either.	3
1	Someone should tell the editor who came up with the title that being "undressed" and being "dressed down" are two very different things.	3
1	But she's a successful CEO! Therefore she should be president and run the US the way she ran HP. That's just logic silly liberals.	3
1	In addition to laying off those workers she also decreased her investors' wealth significantly ([HP stock was around 100 / share when she took her position and down to the low 20s / share when she left](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=HPQ&amp;a=06&amp;b=2&amp;c=1999&amp;d=00&amp;e=6&amp;f=2005&amp;g=d&amp;z=66&amp;y=0)).  And as a reward for her endeavors [she received a $21 million cash severance package as well as a further $19 million in stock options and pension benefits](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1848501_1848500_1848417,00.html).	3
1	While I cannot comment on who has the upper hand in the argument itself, as I do not know enough about either of them, I will say that I came away from this respecting Harris' approach more than Chomsky. It seemed like Harris was attempting to have a rational discussion and from the get-go Chomsky was on the offensive. I could be wrong, but his remarks to Harris just felt pretentious.	3
1	I've never read any of Harris' work, I've seen maybe one interview with the guy. I guess that makes me a "standard Harris-apologist".	3
1	I can attest for that. I am going to write a book someday about it. How the US is allowing Virginia's Appalachian population to be sick and pregnant with no access to the drugs and care that they need unless you fall into a very narrow margin to receive it for free. As soon as the child is born he or she receives WIC but still nothing for the mother for any medical needs post-partum.	3
1	Wasn't Obama's mom a US citizen when Obama was born?  Why was the birther movement even a thing?	3
1	Do we have any documented proof that this Sen. Rafael Cruz's MOTHER was actually a U.S. citizen when he was born over-seas to an alien father?   I just want to see the proof.	3
1	If there's one thing us normal liberals, conservatives, Republicans, Democrats, independents, etc, etc can all agree on, it's this.	3
1	NSA to world- "Cool story, bro..." then back to business as usual.	3
1	The medicare fraudster wants to cover the the poor's healthcare? Well that will be one helluva irony.	3
1	While I see the irony in this, I feel sorry for the people of Florida.  Oh yeah, and Rick Scott looks like a lizard.	3
1	its like he's not even trying	3
1	"Nike will bring it's slave labor to new and exciting places all over the globe"	3
1	IIRC, the judge dismissed the suit saying that the Federal courts are to answer constitutional questions, not theological matters.	3
1	Do you really want to be working in Slovenia or Turkey? You could easily reverse this graph into "median wage as a percent of minimum wage" to show US near the top.  Maybe we're making too much money on average?    This graph is missing too much information to be useful.	3
1	You act like those groups had no voice with candidates before Citizens United.	3
1	Maybe it doesn't. Why do they have to be different?	3
1	It was in response to the question, "Would you say you're more liberal than the most liberal democrat?".	3
1	It's hard to hold on to the past when scientific progress routinely contradicts that notion.	3
1	Modern Day American Conservatives are best understood as "Orthodox Capitalists".	3
1	Whenever I hear someone say "I'm not a scientist..." I want to punch them in the dick.	3
1	Reveling in someone's suffering is not a good thing.  His past doesn't matter.  He is a human in a bad situation and needs help, not a public whipping and shaming.	3
1	First I would make him video record how foolish he and the state of South Carolina have been.	3
1	Or he could move to Massachusetts and be eligible for RomneyCare.  Source, I was.	3
1	the worst part is that he now wants we the tax payers to pay for him.	3
1	I agree but his staggering ignorance must be showcased. This guy also made a very comfortable living off of other people's misery.	3
1	I agree that he shouldn't be punished and he should get the care he needs.  I do, however, also believe he should be held up as an example.  5 years ago if you had told him about someone in his exact situation he would have said tough.  Maybe pointing out examples like this might help some people realize that they are not the infallible supermen they believe themselves to be.	3
1	I find it funny that these people are basically saying that they have a right to healthcare. They're describing universal healthcare. However, if that were seriously on the table they would almost certainly vehemently oppose it.	3
1	Entitlements are only horrible entitlements when someone else is entitled to them.  If I need them they are basic necessities of a modern society.	3
1	Agreed. If he'd just said "shit, I fucked up. I gambled on insurance, and I lost. Better take care of my eye, figure out a payment plan for the treatment I receive, and get on health insurance ASAP next year", which he can totally fucking do because the ACA eliminated the concept of pre-existing conditions, I'd just feel bad for the guy. Instead, he's being a real dick about it.	3
1	Take their tax-exempt status.	3
1	This is the guy.	3
1	I would say your right in almost any other reference to politicians but if you look at Bernie's record, he not only has always said this he has a long history of introducing and passing legislation that backs up these statements. Obama did not. There is a significant difference and I'd urge you to not give up on politics but on corrupt politicians.	3
1	I also believe that's Obamas presidency would have gone a lot differently if he didn't inherit the mess he did..	3
1	Stoked to volunteer for this guy.	3
1	Actually, it's morally consistent.  If their argument is that the fetus has a right to life, than that right exists regardless of conception method.    I mean, they're wrong about the whole thing, but at least they're consistent.	3
1	That is precisely the face that belongs on the underside of a toilet seat lid.	3
1	I heard this live. Has anyone else noticed that every time a Republican interups a reporter and calls them stupid it's a woman? Maybe that's a coincidence, maybe not.   Also he could have given the exact same answer without being an asshole. He acted like a child.	3
1	Maybe not but he was totally disrespectful to that reporter. She had to ask that question to get his perspective on a narrative that's been reported widely. She may even agree with him but if no one asks the question you'll never hear the other side of the story.   There is no excuse for the speaker of the house to treat a reporter or anyone else like that.   You do that from anywhere but a podium you're likely to get socked in the mouth.	3
1	He thinks it is a stupid questions because we all know that Amtrak is on a very long list of things Republicans hate. Now if Amtrak was Privatized it would be a very different story.	3
1	Privatization is the panecea of the ignorant.	3
1	Can't afford health care? Why, just buy a $550 watch! Makes perfect sense.	3
1	Like a doctor would do ?	3
1	Jeb in five years... "Look at all these moochers with their Apple watches."	3
1	And that replaces health insurance? I wasn't aware having an expensive watch covers broken bones and hospital visits.	3
1	The point really is that Jeb Bush is a moron. Like Jr.	3
1	Are you actually suggesting that a watch could be a viable replacement for health insurance?	3
1	You are aware that many cancers have little or nothing to do with lifestyle choices?	3
1	No but a watch is no substitute for health care from professionals and health insurance. You did read the article right?	3
1	Grasping at straws. A watch can not replace a doctor and repealing Obamacare means 8+million people will not be able to see a doctor.	3
1	So why bring up repealing Obamacare in an Apple watch health function conversation? Your foot-in-mouth disease looks terminal.	3
1	This guy is so out of touch with reality but very much in touch with his Apple stocks.	3
1	Can't afford your chemotherapy? Get this ridiculously expensive watch instead. Think of the savings!	3
1	Is that all you think managing health is?  Not eating donuts?  I don't know about you, but I can't check my own cholesterol level.  I need a doctor for that.	3
1	"Hey Siri, how do I set this broken bone?"	3
1	So everyone should ask their Iwatch if they should have that dognut instead?  Thats what you are saying?  Rad...	3
1	Not to mention one of the most important aspects of the ACA is to protect people from medical bill debt due to a once in a blue moon accident, not people will long standing obesity problems.   But the best part is, it can help both!	3
1	They'll be calling them Obama Watches for some reason.	3
1	Do we really need another Bush in office? Um... NO.	3
1	&gt;This is an implication of her utopia that Rand never addresses.   It is as though she doesn't know what she is talking about and is simply a third rate thinker, elevated by fourth rate feckless dodo heads.	3
1	I like my doctor just fine.	3
1	I'll be voting for Sanders in the primaries; if he wins, it's evidence that he can (and probably will, given the GOP field) beat whoever the Republican nominee is. If he loses, Clinton wins the presidency anyway.  Really, it comes down to the fact that the GOP field is so god awful that even their own base doesn't want to vote for any of them.	3
1	Good. Let's see them take on Sanders.	3
1	Yeah no shit. This is what gun nuts here in TX completely overlook with this new open carry law that is being worked on.	3
1	Conservative logic: it's my right to bear arms  (by my I mean me and people who look like me)	3
1	Well, come on. He had cornrows. /s	3
1	It is legal to open carry there, no different than carrying a pistol. Both should have been left completely alone, even questioning the white guy was an overreaction.   My assertion, is both is blatantly wrong, regardless of race.	3
1	I wish they would have had the two dressed identically and had their guns identically shouldered. When you are doing an experiment you should only have one variable at a time. Dressing differently and carrying the gun differently are distinctions that may have influenced the reaction. Having one guy in jeans and a polo shirt with his gun slung over his back may cause a different reaction than that same guy in a t shirt with his gun lower on his back hip.	3
1	Probably not, most cord cutters are probably younger, not the typical Fox news audience??	3
1	Been hearing this for the past 20 years. Literally.	3
1	"The good die young but pricks live forever." - Lewis Black  It is like the villain henchman that reports to his boss that he killed the hero without seeing the body. I too will believe this when I see the rotting diabeetus stricken corpses attached to their hoverounds!	3
1	No ones saying a child conceived of that situation is evil. I assume you're being hyperbolic.   The reason people are upset at this disregards a women's right to choose what should happen. The statement upholds a narrative that says women should be happy to be pregnant, no matter how they ended up that way.  If a women keeps a child who's a result of rape, she should be commended and her choice respected. However, it needs to be her choice.	3
1	Here's his actual quote: “Obviously rape is awful. What is beautiful is the child that could come from this.”  I think this is a matter of something that came out wrong.  At least that's what I really hope happened.   I hope what he meant to say was "A child that comes from rape is still beautiful." (Because I assume this is supposed to be an argument against letting rape victims get abortions.)  Instead it sounds like he's saying it's beautiful when a woman is raped and ends up pregnant.	3
1	Dick Cheney is immortal.	3
1	And if anything the party has become more powerful and more conservative in that time.	3
1	I dunno. Since I got my first internet access in '98 or so I've gone from slightly right to way, way left. And I'm totally embarrassed about how amazingly ignorant and brainwashed I was prior to that.	3
1	Well seeing as how this is /r/liberal I'm not about to throw my support behind a former Walmart executive running for president just because they have a (D) by their name.	3
1	Absolutely untrue. What we need is a massive grassroots organization and millions of Americans who will stand up and fight. Join us at /r/SandersForPresident and see what you can do.  As long as you repeat the message our inept media puts forth, it will be true. When you want change and *do* something about it, change happens.	3
1	That's a self-fulfilling prophesy, and it's not true. Sanders is who we thought we were voting for in 2008.	3
1	Sanders. Clinton is bought and paid for by the banks and refuses to answer questions. We don't need a Clinton or Bush dynasty we need plans to move us forward	3
1	Of course he has a chance, we just gotta make it happen.	3
1	Sanders. He is saying the same shit I have been saying since 1980. Hillary seems a corporate Democrat to me. Corporate interests have entirely too much power in the US. They are not people. Money is not speech. Free trade agreements that abandon  workers in the US to trying to compete for wages against people making $10 p/day are treasonous.  Bernie, because I am not a serf.  Edited because autocorrect.	3
1	Pretty much all of the crazies are old people.     http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/25/the-gops-millennial-problem-runs-deep/      Once that big glob of super-conservative elderly people dies off, hopefully our politics will start correcting itself towards sanity.	3
1	I believe that the Republican Party won't die off, because fiscal conservatism seems like it will continue to live on, but I do believe that the social conservatism aspect of the Republican Party will die off as the baby boomers continue to dwindle in number.  But as a whole, I think that the Republican Party will have a massive decrease in number as a whole, but the party as a whole will still live on.  Just my personal opinion, however.	3
1	"Limitless"?    That's a silly thing to say.  Influenced by propaganda much?	3
1	Because they agree with them.	3
1	Good!  That damn evil muslim atheist commmunist stalin-loving socialist racist narcissist kenyan liar anti-christ deserves it!  /s	3
1	Not all conservatives are racists, but most racists are conservatives.	3
1	Is it just me or is this just a different format of the wifebeater saying "you can't leave me, you'll never do any better."	3
1	I'm slightly better than ISIS: the 2016 Ted Cruz campaign slogan.	3
1	It is scary that I am starting to see his bumper stickers on cars for President.	3
1	and christian's should too according to their book.   Edit: not a suggestion, just pointing out what it says in the bible. Which Ted Cruz follows, so he isn't any different than ISIS.	3
1	I don't see why black people were concerned with Anti-miscegenation laws in the north . In southern States they would be lynching them.	3
1	It isn't scary if you want a Democrat to win.	3
1	Here again we see the American sickness of equating wealth with intelligence.   Ben Stein is a cunt.	3
1	&gt; “if you took all that money and gave it to the dumber people, who are way below the poverty line, they’ll be better off for a little while.” But, Stein said, they will still fail. Not that they are destined to, as he claimed that “any person in this county…can become a middle-class person, unless he’s mentally or physically disabled.”  What an ignorant man.	3
1	Ahhh yes. Because rich people don't just go to school to party, fuck, drink, and get stoned...	3
1	Of course it isn't decided, you stupid fuck. That's the great thing about science. The only people claiming it is decided are anti-science morons like you and your miserable party. You have absolutely no data on your side, but that doesn't matter. You don't *believe* in data.	3
1	It's really arrogant to say that science is decided on gravity. It's just a theory.	3
1	These people don't really believe what they say - they are just a paid mouthpiece for oil, coal, and what's left of manufacturing industries.  In my opinion, that is far worse than actually believing it.	3
1	lets consult the bible and see what that says about climate change?  WELP!  IT SAYS NOTHING! sounds like you assholes made this up, JUST LIKE YOU MADE UP EVOLUTION AND DINOSAURS!	3
1	It isn't gravity. It's Intelligent Falling. (God bless The Onion!)	3
1	Whoa whoa whoa. Jesus rode a dinosaur!	3
1	Add this to the ever-backpedaling positions of the GOP on climate change that still allow us to do nothing about it.  position 1: climate change isn't happening!  position 2: climate change is happening, but humans have nothing to do with it!  position 3: i'm not a scientist  position 4: [Jeb] "I don't think the science is clear what percentage is man-made and what percentage is natural. It's convoluted."	3
1	CONFIRMED:  He's as dumb as his brother.	3
1	Gravity is more a theory than Evolution, my friend. We don't know shit about Gravity.	3
1	Yeah but this would never work in the U.S. because of some bullshit excuse the right wing media will come up with.  ^^But ^^it ^^would ^^really ^^work.	3
1	So you are telling me that the GOP talking point on this is wrong. Well I am shocked by that. They have been right on on much else:  * the dollar has crashed * inflation is rampant * all guns have been confiscated * Obama has declared martial law * death panels are everywhere * gas is $10.00 per gallon - when you can find it * interest rates are 100% and rising   Odd they would miss this one.	3
1	I think she could have beaten up that strawman with half the words...  There is no reason why a fiscal conservative couldn't support complete drug legalization, nor a robust safety net if it could be demonstrated to have a net positive impact. Just as there is no reason a fiscal conservative would support enormous wars. Just because Republicans stand for something and they *call themselves* fiscal conservatives doesn't mean they are nor control what it means to be one. Just as the democrats pathetic reluctance to fully support gay rights, support unions, and keep money out of politics doesn't define being a liberal.	3
1	"Fiscal conservatives advocate the avoidance of deficit spending, the reduction of overall government spending and national debt, and ensuring balanced budgets."   Do you guys think this goes against having a strong social safety net, etc?	3
1	I'm having trouble understanding how voter disenfranchisement relates to fiscal conservatism. Voter ID laws and gerrymandering have seemingly nothing to do with *any* sort of economics, let alone fiscal conservatism.	3
1	Probably best to use the [Do Not Link](http://www.donotlink.com/framed?711000) version. It's a pretty offensive page.  I have little interest in going through each and every one of his claims pulled directly from partisan conservative sites. If you have the stomach for this kind of victim-blaming then Google is your friend. The EPI just put out a study debunking his claim that poverty and crime are both recent phenomenon and self-inflicted.	3
1	...I'm not a democrat.	3
1	is there a way for a party to kick someone out? kinda like excommunication?	3
1	Guy who wants to get elected says the things he needs to say to get elected.  News at 11.	3
1	Oh good, so rather than the traditional choice of slightly conservative or stupidly conservative, it's two of the latter.	3
1	...I seriously hate that I live in this state.	3
1	Can this be how we get the conservatives to also boycott Wal-Mart?	3
1	It should be how we get liberals to boycott Hillary Clinton.  Sanders is the only liberal running in the primary.	3
1	She looks like she's 30 in that video.	3
1	That's because this is a 25 year old video, from when Wal-Mart actually did care about their workers, and prided themselves on American-made products in their inventory.  But you weren't supposed to think about this video with context.	3
1	This is an old video that has no context in the current election.	3
1	Um Hillary was there when they were union busting.  They have never not union busted and were no better then.  In fact Walmart didn't get big until it started sourcing from China and starting the trend of the race to the bottom in buying cheap products from people using what is in effect slave labor. Sam Walton started the China deal too.   http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/walmart/secrets/wmchina.html	3
1	Yes they were, but workers weren't also treated like expendable trash like they are today.  As for the rest, this was before all of that.  I'm no Hillary fan, but the hamfisted stuff that gets posted out of context to bash her is so much like Swiftboating that I'm sure if it's the Sanders contingent here that got militant *fast* or Republicans pretending to be liberals.	3
1	Fair enough. I just think that reaching twenty years into the past to find ways to bash Clinton is unproductive and dishonest. She's done plenty of stuff recently that you can criticize. At this point it seems that people are grasping at straws just to smear her.	3
1	Chances are were upset because you're clearly looking at it from the rich guys perspective. The cartoon isn't trying to say that he was a dick and that he should have been brought up with more humility. Nor is it saying that people should have treated Paula better. It's merely pointing out that these inequalities do exist and that in some instances there are real reasons behind it. You're not wrong in any of the points you brought up. But if I had to guess, you upset everyone because you MADE IT a big deal by effectively saying, "That's not fair to Richard!"	3
1	Richard was handed his life on a plate. All he had to do was not throw it away, but his life was so cushioned and protected that he doesn't even realize that. He has no idea of his privilege.	3
1	"All he had to do was not throw it away"  I'm a "Richard" &amp; my Ayn Rand libertarian older brother just doesn't get this point.   In general, the first thing I'd ask of the "Richards" is that that they don't make it even harder for the "Paula's".  Be willing and eager to pay your fair share to ensure access to better education and healthcare for all, for the good of society.	3
1	I think that maybe you are just looking at it the wrong way. You are not wrong when it come to Ricahrds work ethic. However, its not about his work or even his advantage of being born into an a certain enviroment. It is about whether or not the Richards of the world recognize that they *do* have advantages over the Paulas from the get go.	3
1	[A lot more than Sanders](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html).  In fact, two people who aren't even running are polling higher than Sanders.  While he's loved on Reddit, he's basically not even in the running outside of our bubble.	3
1	Is this a good thing or a bad thing? I mean, none of those mentioned are serious contenders.	3
1	You know, even if he doesn't win the Democratic Primary, I'm glad he's running because he's shifting the conversation to places it needs to be, and hopefully that will pull other Democratic Candidates more to the left.	3
1	I'd gladly waste my vote on him. Imagine a candidate who is actually one of the people and doesn't have big money backing him.	3
1	I mean... how can it be global warming if there is snow in December? Doesn't add up.  /s/Every Texas Politician	3
1	I thought God was punishing Texas for being gay.	3
1	Ah well they'll just continue to bury their heads in the sand, right up until they drown.	3
1	Fuck that. The union heads want to stuff their pockets just like the corporate owners do. The workers have finally gotten what they need, the unions need to stay on the right side of this issue. The hypocrisy is disgusting, and the argument that they are moving towards the Nordic model is just an excuse.	3
1	There was a brief period in our history between ~1930 - 1989 where some very clever con-artists exploited one tragedy after another to convince us to shift to the right - other than that, the history of America is the history of a steady march towards the left and progress.	3
1	Good thing they (republicans) have got the money, courts and gerrymandering down.	3
1	Death rattle. It always get louder before the silence.	3
1	I'll believe it when I see it.	3
1	The irony... how many abortions do you think this policy caused?  How many people were afraid to have a child because they'd lose their job during a recession?    Good job United Bible Fellowship Ministries... do you think Jesus would approve of this behavior?	3
1	Kind of a low award considering how flagrantly they violated the law.	3
1	The next 17 months will be a political comedian's version of heaven on earth.  WTF is Jon thinking???	3
1	It would be nice to see him pop in from time to time as a correspondent, but I think it would kinda derail the show.	3
1	PLEASE STAY JON  This one is gonna be good.	3
0	So you want to take a second risk on Nadering this election?	3
0	I think it's fairly obvious President Obama has been divisive for political gain.  It's worked in his favor, because it rallied the troops.  But, he's done immeasurable harm to the country in terms of unity.	3
0	&gt;When you destroy your neighbors things you *should* be punished.   I don't disagree, but the punishment should be proportional to the crime, and nobody would suggest that crimes against capital shouldn't be treated with more leniency than crimes against actual persons. Clearly then, if the police can murder with no consequences, it must follow that no punishment is necessary for rioters, thieves, or arsonists.   All this focus on the obvious criminality of riotous behavior serves only to distract from the real issue of said behavior on the part of law enforcement agencies, as well as the more subtle systemic oppression of the poor and powerless classes.	3
0	Ah well, everyone knew this shit would happen. If you didn't vote, don't bitch.	3
0	Obama took big money. You have to be elected to make change, and it's important to recognize realities that face political field. Bernie Sanders isn't taking big money, but he also isn't going to win.	3
0	Speak for yourself, I need lamps.	3
0	Absolutely -at the people who didn't. But given how shitty the voter turnout was, there won't be too many to ask your question.	3
0	It does seem to be correlated with a very high death rate that [other developed countries don't share](http://www.humanosphere.org/science/2014/03/visualizing-gun-deaths-comparing-the-u-s-to-rest-of-the-world/)  But it's also putting the toothpaste back in the tube at this point, I don't see a clear way out to get to where Europe is with this.	3
0	No, it's just caused by blacks. Sigh	3
0	Only at the people who didn't vote? How about those in Congress who voted for this measure? May I complain at them?	3
0	&gt; I'm not willing to let others play my odds for me when we see countless instances of kitchen fires, car crashes, and violent crimes happening all across the country every day.  So, you don't believe in insurance?	3
0	&gt; Kochs/Adelsons  No they won't. Sure, they'll donate a couple million themselves, but certainly not $1-2 Billion	3
0	&gt;You should be. You should be furious that it's legal for that to be called "free speech"   Only if it's a secret. If I have a million dollars and want to run ads that say "Bernie Sander is a crazy loon" I should be able to. It's my money.   But the ads need to identify that I paid for them. Hiding behind PACs is the problem. If Soros or the Koch Brothers or the Sierra Club or the NRA want to buy ads them they should be id'ed in the ads.  Free speech isn't secret speech.	3
0	The article says "Koch brother candidates" will spend a billion dollars. You said the Koch brothers will spend a billion dollars. That is silly and incorrect. The koch brothers are rich, but they aren't that rich (nobody is) that they can drop a billion dollars on a campaign every four years. They usually drop a few million, but their personal contribution does not reach the tens of millions, let alone billions.  So in light of the above information I must ask, did you read the article? Was your comment a serious comment?	3
0	So a group of people coordinated by the Kochs is spending lots of money, once again, the Kochs aren't spending a billion dollars here.	3
0	It seems to me that this article is heavily biased. Now, that doesn't mean that its position is necessarily wrong, of course, but it does cast a shadow on its credibility, which goes against its mission to spread that position. I don't think this is high-quality content at all. I would much prefer to see unbiased articles that are capable of inspiring good discussions.	3
0	Came here to comment, but you said everything I wanted to say.	3
0	Evil conservatives. They are so racist and sexist. They are bigots. They are ignorant.. That's all I got	3
0	Only 30% of Americans own guns. Polling shows about 50% of the country is in favor of stricter guns laws. So I completely disagree with the notion that stricter gun are a fringe position.	3
0	If you claim to be a Christian, you're a Christian. There is no such thing as a "real" Christian.	3
0	Oh ok, I understand.	3
0	&gt;if there is social space for people to live out religious disagreement.  Quite what does that mean? We already have the freedom to disagree or even outright refuse to believe. What social space for disagreement do you lack?  &gt; If that's what reclaiming secularism means, I am all for it.   That's not what it means.	3
0	There are Atheist Christians. It's a real thing. They are Christians and also atheists. There is no logical contradiction in that. You seem to have the typical confused internet definition of what atheism is instead of the correct one.	3
0	&gt;he Baha'i cannot say "I don't want a liquor store on my property." And that means one no longer has separation of church and state.  And so you think that means we should just make it worse?	3
0	So you're telling me that areas that have the highest drug usage and have the most poverty are the same areas that have the highest drug arrests? Oh what a scandal. And which neighborhoods do you think drugs and gangs have the most detrimental impact? Really besides stating the obvious, what is the purpose of this article? I was waiting for them to also say that the sky is blue.	3
0	Bigotry isn't cultural diversity so what you say has no meaning.	3
0	You're kidding, right? Since when have police and the legal system been free? And the rich pay more for it *per capita* than anyone else. (They overpay for their percentage of income, as well.)  On the federal level: http://www.heritage.org/federalbudget/top10-percent-income-earners	3
0	Just go with it, you'll be happier in the long run. /r/nobody2016	3
0	So, basically, he's the democratic Ron Paul?	3
0	Except they exist. Therefore they do. It is an empirical fact that there exist people who are atheists and who are also Christians.  I feel like I'm talking to fundamentalists.	3
0	&gt; No, I would tell jews the man using the excuse about kosher wine, really wants them dead.   So Jews give up their ways for the sake of protecting all minorities?  I still don't see how that works	3
0	&gt; You don't give a fuck about jews. or gays. or anyone.  On the contrary.  I want to see a world big enough to have a place for everyone.  That requires an understanding that non-uniformity in norms, rules, restrictions, and interaction is desirable.    It seems to me that really only Christians, Muslims, and Secularists want to take that away.	3
0	i don't know about that.  Quakers explicitly reject creed or belief as a requirement for religion and they are historically Christian (though a demotic split unlike Lutheranism, Calvinism. Methodism, etc).  Christianity originally made belief a religious obligation/practice (following some other Hellenistic groups) but I am not sure all Christian groups today require belief.    Many other religions, including my own (but also including Hinduism, and arguably including Judaism) are orthopraxies with very little orthodoxy in them at all.	3
0	Interestingly in Greek Atheos didn't mean non-believer as non-practitioner.  The best translation would probably be "he who has no gods."  Now the origins of "Pagan" and "Heathen" are far more interesting than most people think (not merely rural designations).	3
0	&gt;Modern Evangelicalism embraces inerrancy, dispensationalism and literalism. Reading Rev 11 and Ezk 40-42 as not talking about a physical temple in a physical city (and I'd argue not Jerusalem) is a rejection of a good bulk of Evangelical theology.  Pardon?  Do you really think all "evangelicals" agree on Jerusalem and Israel in prophecy? What do you think the new Jerusalem is in Revelation?	3
0	We cant be afraid of punishing crime.  Yes they may be innocent, but that is always the case.  They get a chance to appeal many times, if we are so concerned about the possibility of innocence then why are they being convicted in the first place?  Some crimes do deserve death.  Lets say we had solid 100% proof like video tape or clear forensics and a confession?  What if someone raped and killed a child and he had the body parts in his freezer and he had video taped it?	3
0	I think we can have both	3
0	This is the standard Harris-apologist line.  Chomsky intellectually destroyed Harris, but he was mean about it, so I'm gonna have to side with Harris.	3
0	I love when right winters suggest that government can't pick winners. Well then, shouldn't we fix that problem? The rest of the Western world has accepted the idea that government, business, and labour can actually work together. If one is failing, the other two become unhealthy in some fashion. They can't accept that a market can become like a clogged drain, and needs regulation and government support to be strong and efficient. What's even more amazing is that conservatives have adopted an ideology that would undo the communities they seek to conserve.	3
0	6 debates is not a process of hiding Hillary.  One per state in a primary that's really already over is in fact quite a lot and offers many shots at Hillary. I was surprised there was that many.	3
0	yes but this is /r/liberal, where anti-liberal propaganda gets posted  and admitting it gets you downvoted. Wont change the fact that its obvious to everyone but you. Keep trying tho, can't give back that Koch money now, can ya?	3
0	Very true, directly. But if being anti hillary makes us get a republican president, liberals and america are fucked. Believe me, I'd rather have him or warren or both but the truth is warren wont run and the average american, whose votes are the deciding votes as left and right already vote their parties, has no idea who he is and will think he's too old. He may be a household name to liberal politically-minded people, but the rest of America doesnt even know his name at all.	3
0	I could care less what republicans think about abortions or gay marriage. No way in hell I'd vote for Hilary	3
0	&gt;Sen. Rafael Cruz  The man goes by Ted. You are doing the equivalent of people writing "Barack HUSSEIN Obama." It's childish. Stop it.	3
0	Right but we are supposed to be the mature ones. There are a VAST number of things to criticize this man on so why stoop to that level and go for the low hanging fruit?	3
0	There are enough reasons not to vote for Cruz without going all birther on him.	3
0	No, the joke was Cruz is in basically the same situation as Obama with a non-American father.   I've seen people call him Rafael enough times already to see it's the same as the "Hussein" thing, and I'm choosing to call it out as childish bullshit. You don't gte to pretend that you're better than the right-wingers when you act just like them.	3
0	I don't think anybody realized that your comment was tongue-in-cheek....You were demonstrating a point...	3
0	&gt;Waste of gov money = Welfare	3
0	Walking backwards towards the inquisition are we?	3
0	Yes...it was...THAT'S THE POINT. It's to illustrate the fact that they said it about Obama but not Cruz.....  It was a sarcastic jab at the hypocrisy of the right, not a serious jab at Cruz.	3
0	Was pointing out your misguided judgement that they aren't giving up on abortions or gay marriage. Yeah. We have.	3
0	I don't think it's a good article, either. The reason I read it was to get a feel for how conservatives actually feel about liberals and what goes through their minds. It's important to read articles like this because it shows us how we could make a more convincing argument towards the right-wing.	3
0	I like what your point in your second paragraph. I agree that there is definitely a lot of logic underneath some of our emotional arguments. I just think we could do a better job of showing them that logic so that conservatives can understand our point of view.	3
0	You could get one of the 10,000,000's of Muslims who reject what happens or the one who is as crazy as Geller. Get the crazy one and then hope your dim-witted viewers assume he speaks for ALL Muslims.  And on the killing gays, I can link to christians who feel the same way.	3
0	It's almost as is the president doesn't have as much power as you think	3
0	This should give the judge all the evidence he needs to have her committed.	3
0	People often confuse ideologies. Is there much of a difference between communism and capitalism? What about fascism or national socialism (nazism)? What ARE the differences between liberalism and libertarianism? Do conservatives and libertarians REALLY have similar economic views?  Let's try to define this better (for Americans). If I get enough responses, I'll post the data and create some (hopefully) interesting charts showing the general consensus between people of the same (claimed) ideology.	3
0	Your question's grammar causes me not to understand it.	3
0	So Bernie Sanders wants to ban unions and interested groups (UCS, AFSA, IAVA, etc) from backing candidates that support the sciences (UCS) or veterans (AFSA, IAVA)?  Dark money is a problem, but banning organized groups from advocating their position and the position of those they represent is wrong.      Sunlight, mandatory transparency is the only viable option.  /gotta love downvotes for being a not-stupid-liberal. ya'll ignorant fools need to graduate from college and get your shit together.	3
0	I don't think overturning it all together is necessary. It needs to be reevaluated, that's for sure.	3
0	I post frequently in r/liberal and r/conservative as well as dozens of other subreddits. And I'm not insulting an entire subreddits, just those down voting OP because he isn't Liberal enough.	3
0	Why should we elect someone who doesn't appreciate checks and balances and the necessity for separate branches of government?	3
0	Because he came from a poor single parent family, and became an award winning neurosurgeon and department head at Johns Hopkins. The man has an inspiring story, and is a fantastic role model.  He's a brilliant, soft spoken, rational, and authentic person, who isn't a career politician. We could do far worse.	3
0	If this doesn't make sense to you, you're financially illiterate. Those cash "hoards" are for the most part overseas and subject to taxation of repatriated, and interest rates are at historic lows. Obviously they would use debt to fund M&amp;A	3
0	Is that really an achievement?	3
0	Oh, I'm not complaining that I get down votes. I expect it of you. I was explaining to OP why he was getting down voted. The hive-mind is strong here, and I was just pointing that out.   How dare I come in here and criticize you? Did I hurt your feelings? Do you need to go to a safe room and play with some Play-Dough while puppies frolic on a television? Are you triggered now? Poor wittle wiberal.	3
0	Oh don't go. What will I ever do without you?	3
0	This makes me sick. I refuse to choose between a douche and a turd sandwich. I need to arm myself for the revolution. We are the 99%.	3
0	&gt; Punishment serves no purpose.  I hope you mean this in this specific case, and not in general - because that would be *madness*. Human beings need to carrot AND stick to ensure they behave well; providing only the carrot will not overcome the natural laziness of human character.	3
0	I'm sure most people would agree but I have a bone to pick here. The English language is fairly well documented and words mean what they mean. Everything is not varying degrees of synonym and apparently this stuff isn't taught in school as well as it should be. Thanks for writing our textbooks, Texas.	3
0	"When millions of dollars stand up, we lose" FTFY	3
0	I remember when Obama made similar promises.    I'm done with politics.	3
0	Im curious if you want him to be your leader or if you just want to impose his leadership on others. His real value is that he would give you access to other people's money, right?	3
0	Doesn't it get a little itchy with all of those strawmen you created?  Since when is a tacky plastic light switch "art"?	3
0	I don't know what planet you're living on, but it bears no relation to the Earth I'm living on, where the only liberal reaction to the Texas shooting I've seen had been to defend the cartoonists.   Speaking as a liberal, I chewed out one of my colleagues in the office for trying to claim the victims should be considered responsible.	3

0	Rather than hoarding money among the 1% and especially the 0.1%, more money will be available for those to spend on necessities. This frees up an extraordinary amount of money to circulate through the economy, which is generally a good thing. My spending is your income, and vice-versa.	3
0	No, we have laws against killing infants too. And coincidentally, it's only people on the Left who have proposed [killing babies](http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2012/03/01/medethics-2011-100411.full) once they have been born if they're not "desirable."	3

Also, diet controls that. Another thing you don't need a dr for and something a device can help you manage. Thanks for making the point of the entire article	3
0	Actually yes. That's exactly what it does. It's a fitness management system designed to monitor many aspects of your  health. Obamacare does absolutely zero for disease prevention. Zero. What do you have to say for yourself?	3
0	Yeah, because the Middle East was such a peaceful utopia before the U.S. Was ever founded. Clearly all their problems are the fault of US foreign policy and not the death cult of Islam.	3
0	No you didn't. You attention whored, got the local security ratcheted up even tighter, and accomplished nothing of any note.	3
0	&gt;it's just being candid.  It's just being dishonest, and bigoted	3
0	I love it how Liberals always describe the act of forcefully taking money from some people and spending it on others as "investing." But when they talk about allowing people to keep more of the money they earned, those tax cuts "need to be paid for."   So they specifically use language of spending when it comes to allowing people to keep more money but use language of investing when talking about government spending. You will never hear a Liberal talk about "spending" money on people and "investing" in tax cuts.	3
0	Liberals do this all the time, not just conservatives.	3
0	They said the same thing about Bush and Gore and voted for Nader.  How did that work out?  You think Clinton and Paul, and by the way why do you only refer to her as Hillary but to Paul as Rand Paul?, will have equivalent Supreme Court nominees?  You think Clinton would sign a bill neutering the EPA?  Or stopping abortions?	3
0	Sanders would get wiped in the general unless it is Cruz.  American independents will not vote for him.  Get a grip.  Remember McGovern and Dukakis?	3
0	As long as it isn't Cruz or the like, that is their aim.  No independent votes for an avowed socialist. I would, but they won't. Unless you are in tune to some history or polling numbers that say likewise.	3
0	A few exceptions don't invalidate it.  Show me some numbers or history.	3
0	Nihilism is a waste.  That isn't how things turn out in other countries when that happens.	3
0	Nihilism is a waste.	3
0	This isn't a scientific theory.  Will you personally apologize when the next Pew poll shows you wrong?  Riddle me this:  Can Sanders keep Virginia, Iowa, Ohio and Florida blue?  If not, then we lose. I don't want to lose.	3
0	I live in Virginia.  What happens in the primary here will answer your question quite emphatically.	3
0	There is no way he sways Iowa, Virginia or even Ohio.  And I have yet to see a Florida election turn on the Jewish vote.  Lose 3 out of 4 of those states = lose the election.  That is a fact.	3
0	So he will win the primary there no problem? Guess blacks aren't voting.	3
0	Blacks will vote for Clinton in Florida.  I can guarantee that over Sanders.  Her husband is who energized them in 2012 or Obama loses. There is a reason they call him our first black president.	3
0	And trying to force liberals to vote for a corporatist lackey is betrayal. If the DNC forces hillary on us we won't be splitting the vote. They will.  Invoke Nader all you want. My vote is mine and it's the DNC's job to earn it. Not threaten and ridicule me into voting for a sellout.	3
0	OP, are you trying to make a claim that the reason the officer acted the way he did towards the black man was because he was black? I would have to disagree with that sentiment, and note that a lot of the hate directed towards the left here in America is because of false or overzealous accusations of racism. To me, this is just two ways that this situation could have gone down, and while it's definitely awesome for the officer in the first video to approach the situation diplomatically I would say that he was wrong in doing so.	3
0	Now this is real race baiting.  Note the cop doesn't take "the bait" until a black guy is thrown into the pond.  I can't wait to hear the deniers' excuses.	3
0	I mean, they said marijuana was really bad, and yet it is one of the most helpful substances known to man.	3
0	&gt; one of the most helpful substances known to man  You are retarded.	3
0	So if cops are racist when they enforce gun control, we should then have more gun control and provide them with more opportunity to be racist?  I mean look at California. The majority of ccw holders are well off white straight men. Why? Because it costs $600, you have to jump through a bunch of loopholes and a sherrif, however conciously, is less likely to view a black man's good cause statement as good cause vs a white person. Gun control has racist origins, to think it's changed much is a bit daft. It's changed like every other form of disenfranchisement has.	3
0	What about my comment was confusing to you?	3
0	So fuck the particular rights of other people that you personally don't find to you liking?  Got it. Liberal much?	3
0	If your argument resembles something like islam is an inferior culture and the west with it's noble and more advanced moral beliefs has the right to bomb islam countries, then you are no different than those who advocated colonialism.  See [G Greenwald's criticism of Sam Harris here](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/03/sam-harris-muslim-animus). I have yet to see any defender of Harris refute Greenwald's points.  It is always a strawman argument: "Well. Sam Harris never said he hates all muslims".	3
0	The cops are cops. They have psychiatric testing, proper training and a reason to be armed.   The random dude with the AR-15? I have no idea if who he is or why he is carrying his gun around. He could be about to open fire on my kids.	3

0	If a child of rape is born, it should be placed in a special isolation chamber. The subject pulls levers to receive food and water. The floor can become electrified, and showers of icy water randomly fall on the subject.   Because it's subhuman, not deserving of love and kindness. It's a wretched horror. It can never be seen as beautiful, and should be prevented from ever experiencing pleasure.	3
0	The NRA just caters to gun manufacturers.  That's who pays their bills.  This is good for business, so they won't step in.  The racial divide caused by police makes people on both sides buy more weapons.  High crime rates and segregation sell tons of unnecessary firearms.	3
0	It's called stealing elections. That's how they got Duyba selected and won the House in 2010.	3

0	I'm sure it's beautiful if you weren't the one that was raped to create it.  It's easy for this guy to say something like that when, not only has he never gone through that, but he doesn't even have to worry about going through that.	3
0	1. The republicans aren't the only ones gerrymandering. Only a couple states don't do it, the rest do it, red or blue.   2. In order to gerrymander in your favor, you need a majority of your party in your state legislature, and that is going to be far less gerrymandered, which means that these states really are red.  3. The districts are redrawn every ten years following each census. If it is only gerrymandering keeping the Republicans in power, the redistricting in 2020 will fix that. So we can revisit this issue in five years.	3
0	The new normal of filibustering everything, do you mean?  Unfortunately Reid failed his party and the country's need for good public policy by being too timid to abolish the filibuster when it first began to be abused.  The Republicans would never have hesitated if the Democrats used it the same way, so there's no point in trying to preserve it for that reason.	3
0	Another bonus is dead people voting doesn't seem to be a hindrance for Democrats.	3
0	The fact that this is true shows how fucked up our political system is. Everyone wants him and he has no chance.	3
0	Instead of some annointed elite who doesn't have to try, the Republicans have competition and choice. They have men, women, blacks, whites, latinos, doctors, business people, governors.   True diversity. Men and women willing to fight for your vote, instead of just expect it without earning it.  Don't dismiss them. Investigate them on your own, and judge them on their merits, unless you actually like having the Democrats make your choices for you as if you were a child.	3
0	&gt;“people who receive government benefits tend to vote for people who support those benefits.”  Or, people who receive government favors tend to buy the government that will give them those favors.	3
0	That folk advice simply isn't true.  The Republicans have threatened to repeal the filibuster if the Democrats use it like the Republicans did.  Leaving it intact was a net benefit for the party that cares only about power and not senate tradition.	3
0	It evens out the extra voting that democrats do.  But I assume you're referring to some people thinking that they shouldn't have to have their legal name actually be on their ID and voter registration?	3
0	Right, because black people are too dumb to have a state-issued ID or something, right?	3
0	The last time the Dems were in that situation the Republicans promised to get rid of the Filibuster if the Dems used the filibuster significantly.  Preserving it was a massive asymmetric downside.	3
0	It's colorful terminology, but let's be completely honest. She is counting on millions of women, and to a lesser extent men, to give her their vote based on their irrational desire to be part of a first in American politics; the election of a female president.   To cast a vote on the primary basis of gender is not only extraordinarily shallow, it's also a bad hiring practice, if not outright dangerous, given that we're selecting the leader of the increasingly less free world.   I don't know about you, but I vote on merit.	3
0	You'd be hard pressed to convince me of that. I imagine we have different criteria, but she's a 1%er globalist puppet. She's not in it for Americans.   You could say the same for Jeb, but the rest of the Republican field is pretty darn good.	3
0	It really is too bad that the abuse of the system hurts people that genuinely need the help up. Reform is needed.	3
0	I mean what they can purchase with out the exception of alcohol is limitless.  Not that they get an unlimited amount-- and no, not propaganda.  My mother was a FIS (foodstamp eligibility worker) for the last 12 years she worked for the State and I did that job myself for a year before doing children services.  I would say I have much more first hand knowledge that I forgot than most redditors ever knew.	3

0	Lol.......just was an "Eligibility Specialist".  What have you been?	3
0	Having lived in more traditional societies, I think the author of the article greatly underestimates the power of women in historical contexts and thus ends up being a sort of cheerleader for the destruction of the family.  But this leads to an interesting question:  If family is so bad, *why support same-sex marriage?*  Isn't there a deep contradiction there?	3
0	Anyone who disagrees with you is a racist.	3
0	No, but the feigned outrage offered by conservatives on this issue makes them birds of a feather.	3
0	Using a racial slur against a minority, yes.	3
0	A liberal would never do such a thing.	3
0	Even if they're trolls, no liberal troll would do that kind of thing.	3
0	Then they're not liberals.	3
0	A liberal kid would not use the word n*gger.	3
0	I think you're naive, then, because as a kid, I was a die-hard Republican (because my parents were), and spewed all kinds of racial and political hatred (that I learned from my parents).	3
0	I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a liberal who would openly use the word n*gger.	3
0	Well, I also grew up around other kids, and knew all of their leanings, because we discussed this stuff in class, so... yeah?	3
0	That's pretty astounding. What makes IRC liberals different from liberals everywhere else? Why are IRC liberals fucking racists?	3
0	I'd LOVE it if you could provide an example of a liberal who would use the word n*gger against a black person in a non-ironic way.	3
0	Budget holes have to be filled and I am sure they have difficult choices to make.  States don't have the same ability for deficit spending forever that the federal government does.  But at the same time.....  This is why our current generation of programs need to be rethought, and why using welfare to subsidize low wages is a bad idea.  Economic commons are the answer, deregulating self-employment is the answer, and giving poor people *productive property* is the answer.  Between these, one can end functional poverty among the poor.	3

0	&gt;You don't believe in data.  Let's keep it real though.  He's just pandering to his base and [more specifically] his donors, just like most of the GOP when they make climate change denials like this.	3
0	I doubt he actually believes this. He is just pandering to his people.	3
0	No wait, local school boards are the YouTube comment section of governments. Local and county governments are the 4chan comment section of governments. State governments are the /r/conservative comments of governments.  Or something like that.	3
0	that didn't come off crazy or conspiracy theorist at ALL!  it seemed totally sane!	3
0	No, the GOP stole the Senate by gerrymandering it.	3
0	I can actually see that in some of my friends who support Republicans.  I have one friend who openly acknowledges that we'd be better off with the social programs the Democrats support, but opposes them because of "principle."  He's one of those people who had a lot of potential but wound up wasting it on drugs and bad life choices.  He works multiple dead end jobs and has multiple roommates to help pay the rent.  He's nearly 40 and still living like he's in his 20s because he has no other choice.  But he can look down on welfare recipients in his world.	3
0	Well, the Chicago Cubs have a chance to win the World Series every single year just like everyone else. But it's never gonna happen. Fiscal conservatives *could* want strong safety nets but it's never gonna happen.  Here's how I see it: if anyone cares enough about the poor and disenfranchised they wouldn't push for trickle down economics as a means to help them. The opposite is also true: racists, homophobes, and bigots aren't pushing to fund Planned Parenthood and increase spending for public schools.	3
0	I would be willing to bet that the generous systems have one thing in common: a large number of non-means-tested programs.  In other words, they are commons-based rather than subsistence-based programs.  But what do I know?  I have only been in Sweden for a few months so far?	3
1	Sounds like a lot of built up sexual tension. Go uhhhh do something about that.  On a side note: You are probably just crushing on him so hard because he is going to be graduating and will be leaving, and you will be alone. That's normal I guess. The best thing I can think of is to stick around here and find some friends to talk to. You are going to have to let go of your crush.	7
1	I decided I couldn't believe in Catholicism at the age of 14. I would love to be able to be a part of a religion but I can't make myself believe it. So right now I'm agnostic. I still think religion is great and most religious people are very nice. Not to mention the huge amount of charity that is done by religious people. It's incredibly disrespectful to look down on them just for their beliefs, unless they are extreme.	7
1	I was actually born as a boy! OMG WOW  anyways I'm learning Russian in school. Also apparently people find grammar and language boring, but to me it's really cool. Huh	7
1	I was once a world champion unicyclist! Also, I was in the circus.	7
1	Ah.Fuck no! My dad is a southern baptist preacher. When the found out i had a boyfriend (now ex) they nearly kicked me out.	7
1	It really is true. Representation in the media is so damn important. I didn't figure out I was trans until I went out and researched it, up until then I was just miserable all the time and hated myself so much. I just wish that there was more representation for all minorities, be that racial, sexual identity, or gender identity. We like to think we're above media influence, but we're not, and seeing ourselves in the mainstream media can save lives.	7
1	I drive subway trains^^^^on^^the^^computer .	7
1	Not true at all.	7
1	lmao. I'm (imo) not hot at all, and I am definitely not stylish, and when I came out, I got lots of support. Your friend is bogus.	7
1	What kind of "friend" is that? And no, honey, you have to own your gayness. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you.	7
1	Nonexistent. The closest thing we have to a GSA is Theatre Club. (I kid, I kid)	7
1	No. That's pretty dicky of your friend. Come out, it's who you are. And fuck whoever thinks you need to fit a stereotype to be something. Maybe tell him how much it hurt you.	7
1	I decided not to go to college!	7
1	You will need to contact Ellen Degeneres for that.	7
1	I think there is something about the perks about being LGBTQ. I cant really say any now, but there is. Maybe try to find a different "group" you can be in. Us, humans are very social animals. We want to be part of something. I have not personalty went through this, but have with something else. When I was younger, I wanted to be "emo". Its kinda the same thing I'm pretty sure. Hope This helps!	7
1	Until you pledge an oath to the Gay Overlords you won't get a copy of the agenda or invited to any of the secret meetings.	7
1	You think we just hand out gay agendas willy-nilly to anyone who chooses to be gay?  First you must prove yourself worthy, fellow homosexual.  Come back again when you've destroyed a loving Christian family.	7
1	Shhh! We can't let *them* know it exists	7
1	First you need to learn the secret handshake and prove your loyalty before you can get your copy. *  (*Must be picked up in SF, CA by appointment only.)	7
1	My friend wrote gay above agenda in their school agenda. It's pretty funny. Since no one else carries an agenda, whenever we need to check a date we ask to consult the gay agenda.	7
1	Well, you can either wait for him to come out if he is actually gay/bi/whatever. Or you can try coming out to him, that MIGHT make him feel better and he MIGHT come out to you as well.	7
1	You have to go through the LGBT process first, don't you know?  You have to get the seal of approval from:  * **L**averne Cox  * **G**eorge Takei  * **B**rad Altman  * and **T**rinity K. Bonet ~~(Shameless plug for RPDR)~~  *smacks lips like Alyssa Edwards*	7
1	I think I might love you..	7
1	I was seriously considering buying a rainbow planner next year and declaring it my gay agenda. Perhaps not the best choice for a mostly closeted person.	7
1	Okay, I'm starting to worry that this entire sub has resorted to writing fanfiction to compensate for the sheer thirst contained within. Well, I can't really deny that I enjoy it, but wow, there's been an awful lot of crazy sex stories lately. Lucky fuckers.	7
1	Hey, we're up all night to get lucky.  But I don't know, fake or not, it helps to know that LGBT people aren't just sitting around. We're getting *busy*. The pimp life chose us.	7
1	You could always ask him, that's what I would do, or tell him you like him. The  simplest answers are always the best ones.	7
1	I think you really gotta ask him. Your story kinda reminded me of how me and my boyfriend were before we started dating, and I'm thankful everyday that he was brave enough to ask me out because he's the best thing to ever happen to me. And if it doesn't work out, then hey - you'll still have an awesome friend! You're both still young, there's no rush for anything serious right now. Just enjoy life, even if it's just as friends =)	7
1	Aw the story of young horny teenager's being overpowered by lust!	7
1	when you get to those "milestones" it isn't fun anymore. its only fun when its illegal lol	7
1	I'm boxer briefs all the way.	7
1	How guys can wear boxers during the day I will never know. This may be TMI, but I like to have some support on my boys, I feel gross and sweaty if I ever have to wear boxers for non sleeping purposes. Boxer briefs all the way: they come in cute designs, make da booty look cute,  and don't leave your balls in vertigo.	7
1	I used to always wear boxer briefs as well but tried briefs once for the hell of it and realized they were like boxer briefs but didn't ever ride up my legs.	7
1	Let him come out to you. He is still pretty young, so who knows if he is just curious. My parents used to always try and hint that they knew, which pushed me block those conversations.	7
1	This thread is truly the pinnacle of /r/lgbteens	7
1	Wait for him to tell you. When he comes out, take out a $20 dollar bill, give it to your wife, say "You win", and then carry on as if nothing happened.	7
1	I would say wait for him to come out to you. But also come up with a way to let him know you're okay with it beforehand. My mom told me a few times that she doesn't care if I date guys or girls. It was relevant to the conversation we were having each time as well. Hearing her say that made me much more comfortable to tell her, and I eventually did.	7
1	No way to REALLY know without asking. There might be signs, but you just have to watch for them. You can try asking if he has a girlfriend to make small talk, but no guarantees. I also wouldn't lead with that, personally; only if you've already got something of a conversation going. If there's absolutely no evidence one way or the other, then I'm sorry to say but the odds are not in your favour.   Also, as another gay rower, there really are few better sports for the people watching, eh? ;)	7
1	It must be hard to be an ally. To try to understand and accept different people is a hard thing to do. It's a good thing though.	7
1	They're necessary, I just don't really like when they try to put themselves in queer spaces. They haven't and never will go through the same experiences as us actually queer people. Don't get me wrong, I definitely am grateful for them, just not when they try to "be" us. Ugh this sounds stuck-up. I don't mean to be that way though.	7
1	The sad thing is I'd probably wear a similar outfit in black, blue, or gray. Also with different glasses because triangle butts aren't my style.	7
1	I'm twelve, and I'm questioning my sexuality, and if I'm gay, and my Dad knew and told me he knew - it would crush me. *DO NOT*, I REPEAT *DO NOT* TELL HIM YOU KNOW.	7
1	Perhaps build up your relationship over the course of the next year, and maybe if you're still committed you could give him a special gift on his birthday. :p	7
1	We need them, and they realise that. That's a good thing.  The only thing I hate, however, is the 'allies'. 'Allies' are the people that are constantly saying things like, 'I love and support my gay friends but I think straight people should have a letter in the acronym/be allowed in gay bars/be allowed in queer safe spaces' and stuff like that. The fake ones, the ones that are 'allies' only because of the perks, not because of the cause. They piss me off.	7
1	triangle butts &lt;3	7
1	Well, my max would probably be +5-8 years and -2 - 3. (dunno why but I would feel weird going out with a 14 yo. I am 18 atm).  BTW, legally you should wait another year to be 18.	7
1	I'm pretty certain I'm going to lose it via male escort when I'm eighty and I'll have a stroke when I come and die. Wouldn't that be quite the death though.	7
1	Man, I should get out more.	7
1	Oh man. I do love this teenage subreddit with all of its delicious age-appropriate content.	7
1	I'm not only an 18 year old virgin, I'm an 18 year old *kissless* virgin. I'm like an ultra virgin.	7
1	If they don't want me to save another's life that is fine by me. Just let the patient know that there was a donor, but he was gay!	7
1	My face was just deadpan because *how does a thought that uneducated even form in your tiny brain*. It wouldn't suck so much if it wasn't my *mom*. The thing is, I actually went to several websites, including various LGBT information sites, to show her that she was misinformed, yet she believes that Urban Dictionary is more reputable than anything I showed her.	7
1	Come on OP, don't leave us hanging, are you?	7
1	Tell her that assuming that you are a bestial/necrophilliac is wrong and insults you.	7
1	&gt; other openly gay students got offended, said it was "homophobic"   Maybe the other students interpreted it as being an act of bigotry from the person who wrote it on the sign. "If you're gay, we don't want your blood because you're gay and gays are disgusting." Misunderstanding.  &gt; vandalism  You did write on a sign that you weren't supposed to write on.  &gt; suspended for...disruption of school because it went viral  Now that right there is a bona fide scummy move on their part. What a really low way to silence dissenters' voices.	7
1	Hah, I didn't really think about posting what I said. I just directed her to an LGBT website that had definitions and all that jazz, and tried to clear up that *no, I do not want to sleep with dead people tyvm* and when she got to the point where she called me a liar because Urban Dictionary said this and that, I told her that maybe she should educate herself before opening her mouth.	7
1	I would have posted the entire conversation, but I got upset and deleted the messages.	7
1	That's like 2nd base.	7
1	Is she Religious?  Link her to the Urban Dictionary definition of her Religion.  Is she Republican?  Link her to the Urban Dictionary page of that, etc.  Find something she identifies with and link her to the Urban Dictionary page about it, because it will talk shit about that identity, guaranteed.   That'll perhaps convince her that Urban Dictionary isn't quite the wonderful source she thinks it is.	7
1	Seriously, who sources urban dictionary for a definition for something important?	7
1	F*ck I hate her so much. Yeah, I agree, all her videos are about being fucking gay. Make something original for once, there are millions of gay teenagers, you are not fucking special. Jesus christ.	7
1	Thanks I thought everyone on here likes her. xD	7
1	I agree with her most times and she doesn't seem like a bad person, but I must say her pretentious slam poetry is obnoxious. I can't watch her either.	7
1	I am not trying to say she is a bad person, but I can't stand people who try to make them being LGBT into something super special, and honestly making 99% of her recent videos about the fact is obnoxious.  And the "poetry" is terrible.	7
1	Lol, so I just sent my dad a picture of something that was on my computer screen (I was too lazy to find it on my phone) I just realized that if you pay attention you can see the tab open right next to it says "WE GET IT, YOU'RE GAY."  That'd be an interesting way to come out now wouldn't it...	7
1	Sounds like a dominance attraction to me meaning you seem to be attracted to those of the Submissive side. And that's ok But try stepping out of your comfort zone sometimes, I never think its best just to isolate yourself to one set group of people	7
1	It's only preference, and preferences change, there's nothing wrong with liking something specific, everyone is different.	7
1	OP's mom, apparently.	7
1	The most important thing to remember here is that sexuality does not need to have a label, and that it is fluid as hell. Only you know what you like, and if you want you can say your orientation is what you want it to be if you talk to anyone about your orientation.	7
1	Sorry,  have to call in sick and stay in bed. I caught the "gay" .	7
1	We'll pray for you.	7
1	&gt; He knows I am supportive of trans genders people and subtly asked me to explain for everyone. I told him to shut up (basically).  ...why? You had an opportunity to soapbox without looking like an asshole. Take it.	7
1	Honestly this is far more funny than worrying. Especially considering the numerous grammar and spelling mistakes in the lawsuit itself.	7
1	I can't wait to get my letter in the mail from the crazy.	7
1	Just be understanding if he says no. Even if he's completely ok with gay people societal pressure, family pressure etc really affects people our age.	7
1	Sometimes I will look in a mirror or see and picture of myself, and my jaw will drop. It's more of a realisation that I am a human being, haha.  But I'll tend to look and think "Wow, I'm really good looking...."     "Damn, I would make out with me so hard right now."	7
1	Uhh more like, "Wow I should give up".	7
1	Or "why even try?"	7
1	"Take them off" 10/10	7
1	Is this from a webcomic series? I love it, it's super cute :3	7
1	So unrealistic.... They wouldn't be on in the first place......	7
1	nah I think you're good, compared to some of this stuff on this sub XD	7
1	I thought it was rather cute.	7
1	[Oglaf](http://oglaf.com/) (very nsfw)	7
1	That. Is. Fucking. Perfect. And Yu-Gi-Oh is awesome!	7
1	That age difference is fine (In my opinion), but legally I'm not sure what happens after he turns 18, you may want to look it up or something.	7
1	I feel like that wouldn't feel very good, but hey, That's coming from the guy with the $217 Bad Dragon.	7
1	The most annoying part is that I can guarantee you that very few kids here (at least at my school) would be bothered by this. It's only the parents (who aren't even going to be affected by this) who want to stop it. Ugh.   Here's the black hole of hate that is basically the epicenter of all this transphobia:http://www.traditionalvalues.org/content/home/37669/fairfax_county_school_board_plans_to_put_transgender_teachers_in_the_classroom	7
1	...yep okay don't know WHAT I expected...	7
1	*Ride me like a stallion*  omg	7
1	Uhhh, my friend wants to borrow that. But just send it it me, okay?	7
1	If it sounds like he's serious, which I think he is, just talk to him about it. Next time you see him, just bring it up casually and ask him if he really meant it, and see where it takes you. Who knows, you might end up getting a boyfriend!	7
1	It looks like it has a rough edge along the length of the shaft. I would recommend doing what you can to smooth that out before use. Anal fissures are a serious thing. Not only are they uncomfortable, they can lead to serious infection. Thats part of the reason I always recommend spending at least $40 on a more decent quality dildo.   Use a water based lube! Water based wont degrade the latex that thing is made out of. Wash it before and after every use. Store it in a cool, dry place. I usually wrap mine in an old t-shirt and keep it in my underwear drawer.	7
1	Pansexual is pretty specific, so Ima guess that he really is pan, meaning you can trust him if you tell him your bi.	7
1	This is the greatest thing I've read in a while. You enjoy that Chipotle because you deserve it!	7
1	Lol I'm pretty sure I saw the exact same post from your son's perspective a couple days ago, but I can't find it anymore.  Hope he sees this.  You're a good dad.	7
1	https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTeens/comments/359afz/ok_im_scared/  Found it.	7
1	Also, here's a hint for you: if you're the son of an IT guy, you pick up some things. Like knowing if a redditor's post involves another redditor, some one will mention his username. And it notifies him. ;)	7
1	I sure wouldn't want my son feeling freaked out like RocketJumpingOtter is.	7
1	Did what I think just happened just happened? Because that worked out so perfectly	7
1	Damn, a 6? You need to take that woman to an optometrist, because you're at least a 7.5.	7
1	TAKE BOTH! Take her as your friend and him as your'e date. Just pick your balls up and ask him (Be a man!) Just dont forget to give them both the right amount of attention	7
1	It could be your subconscious telling you that for you to find a partner you'll have to come out. Coming out may not be the best of the options and certainly won't gain you a relationship straight away but it will make things easier	7
1	Dont be bitter... Just get better ;)	7
1	You are taking your own frustration out on others who go. Dont do that it ain't cute	7
1	Being friends has nothing to do with my point... And the point of a GSA is to meet other lgbt and allies but also to support other so yes there is gonna be a lot more socializing. But the fact that you are calling GSA meetings due to the fact you can not go is a little immature	7
1	Kinda defeats the purpose when they ignore the information. Was the workout right after filling out the form or a day or longer since, as in did he have time to read it before hand?	7
1	All of the ones I've heard of and the one at my school are during lunch break. This works a lot better because then closeted people don't have to stay after school and need an excuse for their parents. Even if they are after school, I still think they are extremely helpful because it provides a safe space for people to be who they are.	7
1	German, bubbly, complete goober. Self stated to be straight, knows how I feel about him. Well, at least I can be comfortable around him.	7
1	Well.Not really a crush anymore since I've been crushed but he was my last crush and I'll say this, passionate, had the fire in his eyes to compete, adorable ski jump nose. Small eyes. Decently big lips. A huge smile which produced these adorable dimples, introverted yet hilarious, was a really good friend too. Our friendship may have ended abruptly and his thought of myself not on a positive note, but, hopefully it won't stay like that forever. Surely I'd love to just be his friend all over again. And make new memories. My crush was one of a kind.	7
1	Tall, like me, adorable brown eyes, a cute but shy-looking smile. Metro haircut, tan skin, the type of skinny I've wanted to be for years. Effeminate, but not ridiculously so, might be gay, but that's not always an indicator. The first asian I've ever crushed on, so obviously he's doing something right. Great golfer apparently  Sometimes I feel like he's interested, but sometimes I feel like he doesn't even know I exist.	7
1	Colton Haynes. The dude is both the most adorable and sexiest person ever at the same time	7
1	I'd say Troye Sivan and Caspar Lee.  Yeah I'm not very original	7
1	You look like Troye? I have a marriage certificate for you to sign right here ;)  Seriously though, the whole of TRXYE is awesome, you should check it out if you haven't :)	7

1	Anna Kendrick, Natalie Dormer, Emma Watson, Natasha Negovanlis, Tatiana Maslany, Kristen Stewart, Evanna Lynch...I have a lot. I just really like girls K?	7
1	Stay calm. Stay very, VERY, calm. If she kicks you out, remain calm, grab your things, and get going. Stay with a friend. If you can't do that, buy a big van (No joke.) and use that as a home until you get a job and a house.	7
1	Oops forgot to mention this is for the Irish marriage equality referendum on 22 May.	7
1	The fact that he said it twice makes me feel like he had some kind of intentions	7
1	I'm sorry things didnt go as planned :/ But everything happens for a reason! Just look back at this and make a joke out of it. And WHERE THE HELL DID YOU MEET ALL THOSE GAY GUYS! Help a tn gay kid out!	7
1	Not really hypocritical... But anyways, those are two completely different situations. You can't compare one to the other because one is human behaviour and the other is human nature.	7
1	yeah, double standards.  It's the worst for gay PDA and 'flaunting your sexuality.'. People actually say "straight people never flaunt their sexuality." Also, how gay relationships = sex and straight relationships = love.	7
1	The good or easy stories aren't usually the ones shared. I'm Bi and when I came out basically everyone's response was "oh OK, that's cool".	7
1	Honestly, its up to him whether or not he wants to address what happened to him in the past. However, if you have reason to believe that he's currently being abused, I'd recommend you tell the police right away.	7
1	Is there some deep philosophical thing that I'm missing here? Or what's going on?...	7
1	Put a brake on the drama wheels there sport. You don't "need" anyone. Please don't devalue yourself to the point where you literally think you're just worthless without another person.	7
1	I love the fact that BMO is genderless! I may refer to BMO as he but its just so wonderful to know he is a little of both boy and girl	7
1	Only go for it if you just want to have a fun time for a bit and if you know yourself well enough that you won't get too attached. Cause long distance sucks. Also, in my experience, going for someone mostly cause they're gay and maybe have some stuff in common can turn out mediocre. But I totally get where you're at and right now you're probably a little head over heels and that's alright. But maybe let that cool down a bit before you make any big decisions.	7
1	Yeah... she obviously doesn't care about your room :p try tidying it, then see if she pulls another excuse. Besides, shouldn't you be allowed to decide if you wanna take your bf into your room? I'd go off on one if she tried to stop me doing that	7
1	Thanks. Yeah I know I'm old enough to make my own choices, but mom still treats me as her baby and has a lot of control over me right now. I don't want to risk making her uncomfortable for my sake but I also want to be treated more like an adult.	7
1	Just clean your room a little, and when you go into a room with your boyfriend, just leave the door open so your mom can check up when she needs to.	7

1	What if it's a mulberry bush? My childhood taught me to go round and round that.  EDIT: In all seriousness, I hope that your parents will get better. It might just be initial shock and you have to give them time and space to understand and accept it. Maybe in a few weeks bring it up again and they'll probably be more accepting after its sunk in.	7
1	I agree that telling someone to kill themselves is wrong.  I also agree that the word "gay" isn't always meant to be an insult to gay people. The word has clearly become embedded into people's vocabulary to describe not so great things. However, just because it has become so common doesn't mean that using it is okay. Telling someone to kill themselves is not the right course of action though.	7
1	It's good you stood up to someone, but NEVER tell someone to kill themselves, no matter how horrible they are. You can never know who will take that seriously or if they are contemplating suicide already and will take it as a sign that they aren't wanted by anyone.	7
1	The internet man. Try some dating apps or websites (probably not grindr or the likes, those aren't really for dating), it's almost impossible to not find at least one guy you have stuff in common with. The internet is a great place for people like us, to help us all find each other and talk. You'll find someone, you just have to go looking.	7
1	I would *strongly* suggest against this.  You don't just do this without asking first. 98% chance you end up looking like a massive creep and he never wants to talk again. Best to explore gay related interest with actual gay people.	7
1	No problem. Attraction makes people do crazy stuff on first instinct, even though it's not always what you *should* do.  I'm looking at you, Homura! Friggin screwing up the Law of the Cycle.	7
1	Looks matter everywhere. It just especially shows like how lgbteens is like the gay dating pool. Looks matter *everywhere*.	7
1	Take him off the pedestal. That solves a lot of things.	7
1	It is, like people say " You don't fall in love with someones personality on first sight ". Looks always matter in dating pools.	7
1	Everybody cares about looks. You can't deny it, but gosh I hate guys who say "I don't care about the look" but then they completly ignore someone who doesn't fit 100% in their definition of beautiful.	7
1	&gt;He is perfect   Is he gay? If he isn't then he isn't perfect; he's pretty much the opposite of perfect.	7
1	A little rude,  but c'est la vie. People do what people does.	7
1	Yeah, he's gay. He's perfect for other reasons outside of his sexuality and looks, though.	7
1	Your crush is gay? Damn dude, you won the jackpott.	7
1	ding ding ding! I wish... that My crush was gay.	7
1	I'm really into indie stuff, been digging Bombay Bicycle Club and Vampire Weekend recently!  [This] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oDuif301F-8) is quite good :)	7
1	Right now I'm superhyped for twenty one pilot´s new album, Blurryface! Otherwise I'm into other kind of poppunk music, like Paramore, Green Day etc. I'm also completely obsessed with Lady Gaga.	7
1	Aside from showtunes, I like jazz, Frank Sinatra stuff, Edith Piaf, and I like Lady Gaga, Sia and Gwen Stefani.	7
1	I'm super into punk and alt rock, but I also listen to sort of just alternative bands like of monsters and men ("little talks"). The majority of the music I listen to now is either anything by My Chemical Romance (and their music after the split) and Against Me!	7
1	I'm going! I'll be at Harvard next year if anyone in the Boston area wants to hit me up :)	7
1	Great! If you try hard enough maybe one day you can be PR for the gay agenda	7
1	Classical. The Moonlight Sonata is stunning.  Also, The Wall by Pink Floyd	7
1	It's always tough to come out while you still depend on your parents, so I recommend waiting until you are independent on your parents. It also might help to come out over the phone if you are worried things might get physical. For now, you could probably come out to your sister if you haven't already. She seems like she would be very supportive and help you get through dealing with your parents. On the bright side, you are 17, so you don't have too much longer until you will be on your own and hopefully financially independent from your parents, so you don't have to wait very long	7
1	I can play the skin flute.	7
1	My face is as smooth as a baby's bottom. Hooray. I am not looking forward to facial hair.	7
1	It the worst thing in the world, even worse than body hair :(	7
1	Dude. Someone saying he loves you multiple times probably means he actually *does* love you. I don't think he would go that far just to play with your feelings.  If you want to know for sure, tell him it feels like he's playing with your feelings and you want a serious response.   Seriously, he is so into you. Go for it. :D  EDIT: please also consider his feelings - if he is in love with you, he may be desperately waiting for some kind of response from you (as it sounds like you didn't really say anything conclusive yet). Even politely saying no is much better than no response.	7
1	Being Asian means I only get thin facial hair on my upper lip which I shave every couple days.  Grows back pretty fast though.  I don't see how hair of all things is anything to get depressed over (unless you're a trans girl and it affects your body image), but to each their own I guess	7
1	How would your family react? the answer to the question should determine if his threat holds any weight.	7
1	What a cunt. How would people around you react? How would your parents react if they found out? If you think they won't give a fuck, tell him to go fuck himself. If you think they might, see what he wants you to do and if it's worth it.	7
1	thanks, im so scared. im genuinely unsure as i know my parents love me and all that, but i have been brought up as a catholic my whole life. and barely a day goes by without some homphobic joke or another, so i am genuinely unsure.  Only 2 people know i am bi. him. and my 'Best' friend  I'm pretty sure that my friends would be mostly cool, but im just so scared, and i would find it so hard to tell	7
1	I barely shave. I'm blessed with #twinkface.	7
1	"Wtf!? Oh..." *sighs* have an upvote	7
1	The 2008 me would be so jealous right now.  Congrats!	7
1	The 2015 me is jelly right now.    We didn't even have school dances here in Wales!!!	7
1	The 2014 me is so jelly... lol XD Im happy for you. In the philippines you dont have to wait for someone to ask you because the school assigns a date for you, they assigned me a girl... :/	7
1	The 23rd century me is even more jelly right now.      We don't even have whales here in the future!!!	7
1	&gt;I think the best thing I can do is just stop worrying about a label.  This, definitely this. assuming your flair is accurate, you're only 16. I personally think that sexuality can be subject to change.  For now, don't worry too much about it. Just go with what you think is right. If you want to ask someone out, ask them. Don't worry about if its a girl or a guy.  If you really feel the need to label yourself, maybe you're bi? Idk, I can't say anything for you. Do you still like guys?	7
1	Personally, yes. So yes.	7
1	Personally, I've always felt that north american accents sound very "neutral". I don't have anything against american accents, but in my ears they just sound very plain.	7
1	Eh, some of them. The Boston accent is lovely &amp; I've liked some Southern-y ones, but you ain't got shit on Canadian accents	7
1	Aaaaand she just messaged me back, and she told me he wasn't bi or gay :( I hope she doesn't tell anyone haha	7
1	Without even reading your post, I can just say already that there isn't much you can do. Be there to support her, tell her that there is nothing wrong with being lesbian, an try to set a good example for being a sexual minority and open regarding sexuality. However, for some people, it takes them years to admit to themselves.	7
1	Hi yes hello Canadian here	7
1	Ah, the Valley Girl accent... or as I like to call it, "basic bitch voice".	7
1	lol yep, but i hate it  I have a really feminine body though so if i ever get off my ass and lose some weight i could be a twink ;P	7
1	I prefer chests to be on the smaller side. Don't get me wrong, nothing wrong with boobs, but in my experience I prefer them to be fairly small. I also have a preference to guys over girls, so maybe that's part of it? It's not a strong preference tho, and I prefer kinda feminine guys so idk.	7
0	No one. There is no one running that I like or want to be in office.	7
0	Nobody. I want nothing to do with politics.	7
0	This is a great answer. I went through a phase not too long ago when I got so bothered every time I saw flamboyant gay guys around me. I would always wonder, "why can't they just be *normal*?" But I realized that by thinking that, I was allowing society's homophobic standards for an "acceptable" and "unacceptable" gay person to justify judging someone for who they are. If we truly want equality, we can't let anyone try to tell us that "oh, you can be gay, just not *that* gay."	7
0	Just in case there's any English people reading, in the next vote I'll be voting Green Party.  Also if you don't know much about Englands politics I recommend The Trews, this week is politics week.	7
0	I wouldn't vote for him even if he's similar to Warren cause he's so old and out of touch with the younger generations.	7
0	Martin O'Malley (shameless plug for /r/MartinOMalley) because he [has a plan for reducing student loan debt](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/federal-solutions-to-our-student-loan-problem/2015/04/23/a9ab9f6c-e69a-11e4-9767-6276fc9b0ada_story.html), has a [record](http://www.ontheissues.org/Martin_O%60Malley.htm) that most closely aligns with my values, isn't a blatant socialist like Bernie Sanders, isn't overtly feminist like Hillary Clinton, and gets results, even if they [aren't always popular](http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/30/politics/martin-omalley-baltimore-freddie-gray-responsibility/index.html).	7
0	I am educated. I am not getting involved, though. It's just a ton of people fighting.	7
0	I'm pretty much opposed to the whole system for my own reasons, so I'm not voting for anyone.	7
0	Let's just agree to disagree...	7
0	I've heard it a million times before. I'm not voting and that's the end of it. You can say I "Don't get to complain if I don't vote" or all that shit all you want. I'm not voting.	7
0	Transgender so kinda nothing. Not even being myself in this wretched thing people call a body...   DON'T YOU LOOK AT THIS NIKIE! &lt;3	7
0	You seem to be implying that the changing of the guards that happens every 4-8 years to give everyone the illusion of choice actually makes a difference.	7
0	You're a meanie :&lt; I told you not to look at my comment... Meanie mean mean &lt;3	7
0	You're 16. At this point weed and alcohol are something you should be staying away from. The dangers of consuming crap like that at a young age are far greater than the dangers of letting people know you're gay.	7
0	Your brother is mentally ill and i suggest you find a doctor that can help him.	7
0	I'm in Sweden right now. Where dey at, doe?!	7
0	Dang! Only thing stopping us, haha	7
0	I can diagnose based on the fact that he would break the arm of his sibling just because he is different. Because that, my friend, is a mental illness.	7
0	I'm super drunk right now, and I just saw this response, and I wanted to comment on how similar it was to my situation. then I realized that I actually posted the response. now I'm wondering why I'm bothering to post this response about me responding to my own response while I'm drunk. lol...   don't get drunk kids ahaha it's not worth it...	7
0	I don't have one, but i want one on my lower back :3	7
0	They didn't even say anything about LGBT issues, the only thing that was misleading was overseas aid. lol It's not at all misleading.	7
0	I would be playing it but it's too expensive. :S	7
0	I used to play it at my family's house. They had sims 2 and 3.	7
0	Yeah :D  No Sims 4 though, too expensive :S	7
0	It makes you non-straight. xD	7
0	Agreed. I'm bi, but so much of straight porn is overly slutty. Like are you even enjoying this, or just making strange faces? Those girls need to turn down.	7
0	I'm barely an adult. I like younger people, I like children. I like people in general. I wouldn't harm anyone, or impose on them.But I will be around them, instead of avoiding them. You're  not helping. You seem to misunderstand, nevertheless, thank you for your input.	7
0	He might just just be experimenting.	7
0	*TECHNICALLY* if you were to have sex, you could be charged with statutory rape. Cali is really weirdly strict even if its two consenting, over the age of consent, teens such as yourselves.  However, if neither of you rat each other out to the police, no one is going to stop you. Don't let the fear of what *could* happen overshadow the reality that nothing will happen (other than sex of course lol)	7
0	And the funny part is that it went viral, and one of my friends high fived me through Kik	7
0	Facepalm, Really schools? What you did is perfectly fine in my books. Do you have an image? :P	7
0	Humans still have homophobia and sexism in their minds it's so fucking disgusting... :S   I just looked at my country's list of can't donate blood. It's only for men... Fucking human beings are so disgusting! I'm tired of being alive. FUCK!	7
0	But it is no reason for this rule. As you should be checked anyway. No matter if you are a man, woman, inbetween, neither; gay, straight, bi, pan, demi, ace or any other variation of whatever. Thus that rule is bullshit [PERIOD] The people who believe in that rule are idiots.	7

0	The false negatives can happen with anybody, thus making that argument false aswell.	7
0	The different is no where near that high. It's most likely 0,01 and 0,02.	7
0	The rule is bullshit. Right now men will use a condom. Unless they know neither have an STD. And even then some of them will use a condom because dirty stuffs.   I would totally have sex with another man if i was O-. Just to fucking feel good about hurting other people. And it wouldn't even be my fault. The fuckers who decide this rule will be at fault.	7
0	Why only MSM though? Why not females?	7
0	It feels so much like hate :(	7
0	Oh, I was not implying that you were implying that she was a bad person. I was just saying that I don't think so.   Haha, sorry for the mis-misunderstanding.	7
0	That's quite alright. Well played.	7
0	There's an imgur link of that in the comments of that, just by the way.	7
0	I have the same, i cannot see women as creatures that i have a relationship with. Probably due to being transgender though. xD	7
0	No, it's fine, I'm not complaining. I'm just noting it. I guess it's kind of useless to note it but whatever...	7
0	Maybe make a deal with her? If she does x she can get y? 'If you pull your math grade up by 3 percentage points we can buy some fabric for a cosplay.' and things like that.	7
0	Yeah, fuck people!  *invents otherkin	7
0	"Because he has a penis so he's a guy."	7
0	Because basically there was no point to it. A short topic where all Agree but one is going to make it a tough room. Also, don't wanna start any rumors.	7
0	Well, that's not the only reason he is an asshole. He constantly harasses som class mates for no reason.	7
0	I dislike people that won't vote. Theure a waste to society. Like do your part  Be educated and vote.	7
0	I hope you all vote Green or Labour as they're the most committed to LGBTQ issues! And in my opinion they're just the best options we've got.  It's most important that everyone eligible bothers to vote at all, though. I voted Green this morning.	7
0	Being educated and voting aren't the same thing (why do Labour get any votes?). Also, we all have the right not to vote, which is inherent of the right to vote.	7
0	Greens should of let Caroline Lucas be their leader.	7
0	Why vote at all? None of the parties do any of the things they said they would do... Never happens, liars all around.	7
0	I did vote SNP today, and if the BBC exit poll is correct, then they're going to get every seat in Scotland, bar one.   https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/596419417275248640  58/59 seats is insannnnnneeeeeeee, but Labour are looking to be dead if that poll is correct.	7
0	can we please keep Shitty tumblr fan fiction off this subreddit.	7

0	Have you not actually watched regular show?	7
0	&gt; It's a bit weird and forced if you actually watch the show and see Mordecai pining for Margaret all the time  Because someone *totally can't* be attracted to guys AND girls...	7
0	I DID NOT SAY THAT   I SAID HE'S BEEN OBSESSED WITH THE SAME WOMAN FOR 5 SEASONS IN THE SHOW	7
0	American here but pulling for SNP!	7
0	What don't you like about UKIP other than the candidates that were kicked out because of their views?	7
0	The age difference is fine, just don't do anything illegal.	7
0	VOTE OR DIE MUTHAFUCKA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pSh0VAVYn4	7
0	It is but often times that happens more to closeted people.	7
0	"Be a man!" is sexist if you mean it in a different way than be yourself!	7
0	And again you make it about yourself...  Yes being closeted suck but you have to make the best of it. But you can also choice to be positive while around negative people and place which you seem to have not done...In closing stay strong and keep a positive head about yourself and don't let the negative shit affect to the point of bitterness or immaturity	7
0	It does not help as much as it says it does.	7
0	you are not open to believing me. Fine. You don't have to, remeber that you are sexist then.  I also forgot to say that people also say "don't be a girl" If that doesn't sound bad to you, i don't think you wanna be tolerant...	7
0	You, my friend, are fucked up in the head.	7
0	It means that you dreamt about a cute boy who appeared in front of you saying "For you to find me, you're gonna have to come out"... i.e. absolutely nothing	7
0	The comic is so weird and disgusting... :(	7
0	"I am not homophobic, I'm gay." I have  other gay friends that go to GSA meetings.	7

0	My graduating class only had 2 openly gay guys.	7
0	None of them....	7
0	I think my body sexually prefers women but as shown with my boyfriend my mind prefers men. Also i'm Trans, might be a reason. :D I'm bisexual by the way. But me personally, i don't think i prefer one over the other.	7
0	In the match between TSM and fnatic i was rooting for TSM. But i'm not caring for any team. It was a one time deal. :D	7
0	If you need anymore advice, you can always kik me at f1orini	7
0	No, no. That's the ideal crush, to be honest. Having one can suck (of course not literally, this isn't a fairytale). Everybody should remember to be their own at times. I hope I'm making sense	7
0	You're not missing anything.   Just having a little suicidal bout type thing.      First sentence explains it. Trying tro get something off my mind, and off my chest, maybe a mild cry for attention. I am kinda an attention whore.	7
0	I think I'm worthless in general, but thank you.	7
0	This is also correct to a degree.	7
0	Edgy would be if I talked about how I was chain-smoking cigs before typing that, or going on about how I need a drink or a joint.   I think you have an incorrect idea of "edgy".      Either that or you have an odd social life where this post is similar to people who are trying to be cool .	7
0	Idk, I've never been in this situation before. If it were me, avoid him and don't try to get his number or anything. It'll just hurt that much more when you leave 250 miles away and find out you actually like him	7
0	No it isn't! I totally get where you're coming from :)	7
0	Why would you think that i am not serious?	7
0	Please do something about it instead of just saying "it gets better". It seems like a false promise.	7
0	I don't know, i'm not making that statement...	7
0	Ohhhh it's a figure of speech, what does it mean then?	7
0	TL;DR: I'm lazy.	7

0	ANOTHER *smashes laptop* *uhhh i mean comic!*	7
0	Tell him things that are stupid, fucked up, ignorant, etc are straight. Whenever you see him snidely say there goes that hetero straight boy look at the way he walks he's so fucking straight he should just hide away and do us all a favor. Tell him straight people are the scum of the earth. Make him hate being straight as the words he speaks do to you.	7
0	You should play the first part of "not your kind of people" over and over and walk away like a boss. Just when you are almost gone, stop the music and say "You're all homophobic, yah pieces of poop!"	7
0	You're joking right?  Whether or not you believe it, the words that come out of your mouth are the same either way.  As far as the people you're talking to are concerned, there's no difference.  Then you get labelled as a hypocritical SJW and lose all credibility.	7
0	I've been told since I was very little that I was a boy... Turns out I am XD	7
0	Well, he didn't come to school on Monday and I didn't come to school on Tuesday. And well, I chickened out just now :/	7
0	And you have a reason for making that statement? You are the delusional one if you think that that statement is true.	7
0	I don't, i just can't stand cunts like you who seem to think they are above others because they don't give any reason or arguments for their idiotic statements.	7
0	Still haven't explained why i am delusional....	7
0	No problem, sexist.	7
0	Hmmmmm..... A bit of respect to the man.	7
0	i know, but it pisses me off how i cant seem to have one conversation with anyone without... screenshots	7
0	I'd just advise you not to risk it. There is no point pissing away a friendship over a *very* unlikely relationship that won't last long.  I've been through it and it isn't pretty.	7
0	Ah ye olde curly hair thing xD	7
0	Honey! Please talk to me! Look at your texts please	7

0	DAMN BREEDERS!!!  TURN THEM INTO PANCAKES!	7
0	Are you sexually attracted to men? Are you sexually attracted to women? If the first answer is yes and the second is no, i think you might be gay. The way you act has nothing to do with it. You don't have to be super flamboyant to be gay. lol	7

0	But..its where poop is   icky	7
0	Disbelieve it all you want. It's what the statistics showed. For some reason, you seem to think most people find the idea of getting shit on their dick more appealing than you do.	7
0	What the fuck is this? Joey Graceffagus and Troye coming out? Whats next? Are Tyler Oakley and RuPaul coming out next? Ya no shit we know ur gay.	7
0	The medical and proper term is penis....	7
0	Oops, didn't mean to be an ass..  People just seem to not use penis or vagina even though they are the medical terms.	7
0	Hydrogen will not produce co2 so unless the organic compounds take more co2 to create than they make it's still going to affect the world negatively.	7
0	If you do it through solar power or nuclear fusion, it won't produce CO2 at all.	7
0	She and her partner could choose to copulate with the males before they are killed off... but that still doesn't address what will happen with all the inbreeding that will be required to repopulate the world.	7
0	The problem here is that the teacher is basically forcing a student to do something for a grade that she isn't comfortable with. There is no reason to impose this, as I very much doubt learning genetics requires an actual coupling.  Besides, in this scenario, there's a zombie apocalypse happening. That's a hypothetical. If that hypothetical exercise can take place, then why can't the girl hypothetically combine her genes with a same sex partner? It's not like there's actually a baby, and we're pretty close with technology that would allow two women to conceive a baby without a man's sperm.	7

0	I cant really think of anything else as all of the gay guys in my school(which is a catholic school btw) are out and free and actually kinda loud(im one of the loud ones) XD lol The last thing on my mind is the oh so subtle dick grab which is a very risky move and i dont advice you to do it. I mean i've done it to most of the guys at school and im just lucky i didnt get punched XD	7
0	Sorry I assumed your nationality, however I fail to see how that particular platitude relates to this situation.	7
0	thats how you say hi in my school.(not even kidding) and like i said i dont advice you to do it ;)	7
0	uh huh. like i said, thats how you say hi in my school. nothing sexual. its all just for fun.	7
0	Its called you're only 14	7
0	say what you want about it, but thats what my high school was like, its not like im the only one in my school who did that, i had mine grabbed a few time by both boys and girls... and again, nothing sexual, just for laughs. ;)	7
0	i didnt fully understand the question as i am sleep deprived but i'll have to say no...? oh its on purpose they went like "hey dude" *grabs dong *laughs *waves *walks away	7
0	People get crushes on celebrities???? What	7
0	&gt;Duct tape my feet and my mouth.  Why?	7
0	This is an attention grab.	7
0	Hey, you don't seem to get it. This sub does, it's called me monday. I don't see why it all has to be in one messy mega thread. You're missing the entire point of what I said about support. I said it's not fair to say it'll detract from support when many other types of post are allowed.  The hangout host is the one who told me I was "too negative" and basically told me lol he's him whatever yoU NEED TO BE LESS SERIOUS THOUGH	7
0	Me monday is not self-introductions, most people post weekly. Its to make friends and post selfies lol and like,,,,  Most people are not allowed to create hangouts is the thing. you know what not worth arguing. it wasnt a single person. bye. im done.	7
0	Saw it on /r/furry a little while ago :3	7
0	So you mean to say that having a preference immediately equals transphobia? Just looking for clarification.	7
0	I don't understand why people are giving you hate. This sub does have some issues. I prefer to see a variety of posts, and that dating idea sounds pretty good to me.  I don't want this sub to be all doom and gloom or it won't be fun any more.  Sometimes I get annoyed with the is my crush not straight posts, but they should be allowed here.  Really, I'm looking for variety. Good things, bad things. Confessions, questions, and laughs.	7
0	exACTLY WHAT IM TRYING TO SAY THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS INTO WORDS THE WAY I COULDNT IM ACTUALLY SO GRATEFUL PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE ELSE IS HATING BUT YOU GET IT ITS THE DOUBLE STANDARD YES I FEEL THAT. THANK YOU.	7
0	that what i was trying to say im just not so good at writing sometimes.  no one has ever tried? thats your guess	7
0	This is not that kind of support group. Talking to a counselor is one kind of support. Being around other people your age and talking to each other about your problems is another kind of support. To each their own.	7
0	...you've never talked with your friends about your problems?	7
0	It wasn't at his expense? He made fun of me... The sexism just made it worse	7
0	Do you think I am incapable of dealing with people who lash out at others?	7
0	Because its not my hangout and I'm not allowed! Trust me, my own hangouts would be very different from the current ones.	7
0	I would tell them not to do that, and explain lashing out at others is wrong. I would most certainly not argue that the person hurt is in the wrong.	7
0	The other mods and I 100% support this comment!	7
0	Yes I am? Haha who are you on Skype	7
0	... This was mainly about the double standard	7
0	Usually when I find an unattractive guy, I just ignore them and move on. There's no need to interact with people you aren't interested in.	7
0	These people have not seen those amazing pictures of homosexual people with adopted children who have a lot of fun. I especially like the one with the two men who are helping their daughter be girly. :)	7

0	So basicly eurovision is contest about what country have okay song and what they did in past year , cause it seems like that. Eurovision, where viewers vote for you not based on your song but what your country did in past decade. (Lets not forget that Germany had 0 points and they didnt have worst song)	7
0	This makes no sense in my eyes it's $59,99, $66,01 and $61,91 Doesn't make any sense.	7
0	Why does everybody want to have sex? I wouldn't care about being a virgin until i die.	7
0	You are from UK and it once owned half the world, that why UK got so low place ?	7
0	What is up with you?	7
0	Simple don't have sex until its legal for both of you :P edit: all three of you &gt;.&lt;	7
0	We are literally so superficial r u new ahaha	7
0	Being gay isn't as much of a social stigma as it used to be. Suck it up and go about your day.	7
0	I've considered a poly relationship... I don't know, seems to complicated and difficult to maintain. I mean, I want a serious, loving relationship but what if the other two grow closer and exclude me? I don't know, I always think too much into things like that.	7
0	I can't comment on the long term. But so far everything has been super easy, and healthy.	7
0	Tie your hair back, shave the moustache and the remnants of beard and keep the small bit of goatee.	7
0	what was his name?	7
0	So then why haven't they changed their minds about queer people then?	7
0	Well if you think your friendship will undo 17 years of conservative Christian teaching, go for it. I just would never subject myself to that lol. Kinda like a black guy being friends with a KKK member :/	7
0	It's pretty expected when talking to strangers in the Internet.	7
0	Talking to strangers on the Internet *on Skype*.	7
1	I made the most undignified squeek when it was all wrapped up with it's nighttime story. (✿◠‿◠)	9
1	This is like when I get an error at work that says something like "please contact the administrator." Damn it, I'm the administrator and I don't know how to fix that...	9
1	I've done it a few times when my cat has gotten into things I don't want him licking off his fur. Not something either of us would want to undergo on a regular basis though, so I'd imagine getting them used to it from a young age would be helpful!	9
1	I have no friends to go to for assistance, but my mom said I can move back in if I need to.   So I've got that going for me, which is nice.	9
1	Are you worried about ending up with someone who reminds you of your mother?	9
1	Well Jesus, now I am.  I was watching a show with an actress he really likes and was thinking how hot she is and then grossed myself out because I sounded just like him in my head.  Ughhhhh.	9
1	i threw myself in the middle of some crazy shit. two stabbings, a riot, more fistfights and people fucking on the dance floor than i can count, and a truly insane amount of drugs and weapons confiscated from pat downs. I was sick the night a gun got pulled though, so I never had to deal with that.	9
1	Shit, I only said that because I thought that's what you originally meant. Now i'm the one who put in your head. I am so sorry.	9
1	Has a cat call ever gotten anyone a date?   "Ay lady, you got a nice ass"  Yes,  I feel my pants sliding right off. Meet me behind this bush.	9
1	When you said "deep voice" I knew exactly who you were talking about!  Budapest popped up on a playlist I subscribe to and I really liked it.  Turns out he was opening for a show I already had tickets to, and when he walked out I thought it was the sound check guy because I was expecting a 30 year old bearded hipster.	9
1	Haha it's cool.  I'm bi so I'll just date dudes only from now on.  (My mom and I have totalllly different taste in dudes so that's no worries.)	9
1	&gt; I was expecting a 30 year old bearded hipster  So much this.  Like, a new Ray Lamontagne, or something.  Not some kid.	9
1	I considered going to Comicon last summer to meet Ian Somerhalder. Then I realized that if I ever actually met him, I'd likely start crying and either pee on him like an excited puppy, or hump his leg like...an excited puppy.   I did not go to Comicon.	9
1	Ah man, I've never had the ability to switch up my relationship habits like that. I'll hook up with another dude, but I exclusively date women. I envy you.	9
1	[Ask if he likes the guys in the porn he watches to have small, half flaccid penises or if he likes them to have big hard throbbing cocks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY711HJK7pg)	9
1	Haha yeah I mean I can't exactly control it but I'm usually split pretty even in terms of whom I'm attracted to.  Not that I'm actually going to give up women, I just won't introduce them to my dad lol.	9
1	The idiocy was all mine though. The poor guy just happened to be watching us that night when I crashed my bike and broke my thumb/wrist on the sidewalk. Unless you're calling me an idiot. Which is fairly accurate.	9
1	I went to burning man the past year, my gift to others was the asian facial mask. They were a hit btw. Everyone loves to be pampered on a hot desert day. I gave to everyone in my camp. I saw a bunch of people in my camp laid on lawn chairs with facial mask on. That includes guys and girls. Treat yo self.   Ps. I took my husband to his first pedicure. He loved it.	9
1	we should just have Urinals/no Urinals bathrooms.   thats really the only important bit in a bathroom	9
1	i volunteer as tribute! i'll take umbrage over the offensive toilet sign.   gosh darn that toilet sign. it sure does make me angry.	9
1	That is the cutest/saddest story I've ever heard. Welcome to the rest of your life, kids.	9
1	&gt; The woman you marry cares about your career and your vision of life as well as her own. She knows you also have a plan, and works together with you to achieve the goals you both have. The marriage is her priority.   VOMIT	9
1	That is possibly a dog. Further investigation required.	9
1	I FUCKING HATE when guys, especially guys I'm not even dating, like to comment about how guys don't like lipstick on women while I'm *wearing obvious lipstick.*   I don't go around telling guys their sneans and comedic shirts aren't attracting women!	9
1	Super jealous... Any tips for a girl with an ass flatter than the perception of the earth in 10,000 bc to get a fat one?	9
1	Will you be my hero now?	9
1	"For this everyday look, we're going to do a huge cat eye and purple lipstick."	9
1	and that's only the tip of it. she had a thousand more complaints that were all completely unreasonable. I'm so happy she's gone!!	9
1	My sister got me the gig, I didn't ask too much questions about it, I just said yes, but today she told me the husband is very paranoid and has around 30 hidden cameras at his shop and she wouldn't be surprised if he took the same precautions with his house.   I have a yeast infection too, so it wasn't just a small, discreet scratch here and there.. Nope, I've pulled my pants down and gone to town with the scratching cause it's *bad.*	9
1	"Can you eat my pussy out like a buffet of your most favorite foods?"	9
1	The problem  is when the "status quo" includes things like men being ignored/not being taken seriously as rape victims or victims of domestic violence or the massive stigma  of showing emotion.   Equality shouldnt begin  with insulting and ignoring issues on the other side of gender inequality.  Gender issues impact both genders. This rampant ignorance  from both  sides doesnt help anything.	9
1	Noooo joke! her rules: no walking around the house past 8 PM, no talking in the apartment ever, no having sex in our apartment ever (she can hear it), no friends over ever, no music ever, no DROPPING THINGS ever (she once confronted us that we drop things too much).	9
1	Oh god, I don't want to laugh at your expense but I just picture this and it's cracking me up.	9
1	That is, hands down, the best measure of flatness I've ever heard.	9
1	"What's your opinion on eating ass?"	9
1	Do you love the "tutorials" where they free hand their liquid eyeliner perfectly in one try? It's so fucking simple!!	9
1	You can do this! You know the most important thing to do is to take care of yourself. I know it's going to be tough, but you can absolutely do it! Move back home with your mom if you feel like that would be the best idea. Find things that you love that make you feel good, whether it's yoga, cooking yummy things, going for walks, or just sitting and listening to music.  When you get upset and angry, you'll always have us trolls to send you love and funny gifs.	9
1	What if it was just a very controlled, well aimed shot?	9
1	And then I'm just sitting here like "...where the fuck do you get the money for all this stuff?"  $40 for a 2oz bottle of foundation lol no	9
1	I can usually get one eye okay...but then there's this awful other eye to worry about.   Then I just smudge everything. "Smoky eye it is!" I shout triumphantly.	9
1	It's okay, I've been switching between cracking up and cringing since she told me. I *really* hope he doesn't have them, or at least that he doesn't watch them..	9
1	Yeah, but [these cats fit in cups](http://www.picgifs.com/graphics/c/cute/graphics-cute-160852.jpg), so at least you've got that.   Seriously, that is way to many kinds of bullshit for one human. All I can really offer a stranger on the internet is someone to talk to, but if you want to rant, I'll read the whole thing no matter how long it is.	9
1	Well ya know what--if he didn't want to see you scratching your vag, as is your mother-nature-given right, he shouldn't have secretly videotaped you!	9
1	Please refer to my username to see how into this I am.   It was Smelly Yeti Perfumery (www.smellyyeti.com) and you should probably order all the things from there. All their perfumes are Buffy themed and come with dinosaur tattoos. WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT?!  Edit: also the perfumes smelly really good if anybody cares	9
1	Also there was candy. Best purchase ever.	9
1	TIL:  Women who enjoy makeup and fashion for their own sake are vapid and should be focused on what their men want instead.   A man’s career is more important than a woman’s.   If you are not excited about having children, you are not worthy of getting married.   Your tits are your “attributes” and they belong to your man  Get in the kitchen and make me a sandwich.	9
1	Lol I've been there before with some friends before. "Did you see that tweet about that couple caught doing it in the park over on the east side in rabbit costumes?"  "Uh....no *was someone else there filming that? Shit...*"	9
1	Because she is 8 years old and she's going to want to wear it to school and now my sister is going to have to fight with her daughter over the entire situation.	9
1	Oooh that's a good point. I'd wager you're very prime at adulting.	9
1	You could always offer me more kittens (she said, hopefully).	9
1	I asked my current BF how big he was after we had been flirting while having a very sexual conversation. Let's just say that it led to some amazing things. Some really sweaty, really pleasurable, amazing things.	9
1	Hooray! Now us poor women folk will be able to drive!	9
1	Haha I read that as, "Was someone else there filming that shit?" I was about to applaud you for being brave enough to own it!	9
1	:( I know that feel   It happens less, I get older they get younger and look... unfinished.  But Ezra's a legit crush. Crush on.	9
1	"No, but I bet you can with a shot glass and enough determination".	9
1	Sounds like he needs to up his hydration.  Tell him to drink more water and maybe he'll get the distance he needs.	9
1	Best part: if his favorite buffet is Chinese, then he'll just be hungry again in a half hour.	9
1	I just spit beer down my shirt, omg.	9
1	i FEEL FOR YOU, AND SERIOUSLY UNDERSTAND YOUR WOES, YOU CAN DO THE THING LADY!	9
1	Oh God so true; "My vagina juice is *loaded* with MSG; dig in!"	9
1	And I'm over here like, "wine bottles have holes in them, I don't need no fancy glass."	9
1	One of the troll subs had a Christmas gift exchange last year.  I've been saving up ideas for the next one.  1. [Golden Girls](https://www.etsy.com/listing/223653209/complete-set-golden-girls-prayer-candles) prayer [candles.](https://img1.etsystatic.com/052/0/10754363/il_570xN.743048463_mxiz.jpg) 2. A purse with a false bottom, for smuggling booze like a flapper. 3. And now, RGB earrings.	9
1	No more, please! I am ded from squee! Thank you, seriously.  [You are a beautiful person and I appreciate you](http://i.myniceprofile.com/204/20445.jpg)	9
1	I think the point is that OP's sister has said that she doesn't want her young child to have makeup yet, and someone has gifted it to her without her (the parent and caregiver's) consent.	9
1	I feel like there's a story there that I'd like to hear. If it's cool with you, of course	9
1	You've just taken the first and most important step to getting the life you have a right to have. Good on you!	9
1	ayyyyyyy  so, uh, how thick are we talking?	9
1	Mine dragged me into a hug over the autograph table when he recognized my twitter handle on my name badge.   I'm going to be content and purry over that for YEARS.	9
1	id be bragging about my tight vag.	9
1	That's a great resource to have.  Go.  Go move in with your mom.  It will be hard, but you can't start rebuilding until you go.  Not everyone has the strength and introspection to come to terms with what you just did.  You can do this.	9
1	Me too. I feel like mental health issues are even worse when your life is going pretty well and everybody expects you to act happy all the time. I'll gladly join you in the blanket fort &lt;3	9
1	Well if she sits like a duck, squeaks like a dolphin, and plays fetch like a dog, then it's probably a....wait...what the hell kinda animal is in my house?!?	9
1	I think an army of cats should be recruited to pee in all his shoes and on all his clothes.	9
1	Oh but it's his fault for leaving his shoes and clothes where cats can get them.	9
1	I'm 41 and I'm terrible at adult-ing. At this rate, I might have the hang of things by the time I'm 80.	9
1	Come make one with me. I'm in desperate need of blanket forts and hugs. Kinda feel like my life has done a very unexpected 180 and I was so not ready for it. I'm currently in bed and any movement makes me nauseous. I have a fuckload of pillows and a bunch of blankets.	9
1	"You have a mouth, and I don't see anything good coming out of it"	9
1	Showed my husband this, he took it to mean he doesn't get stuff. I guess it's true?	9
1	Yes! But I want to be Bugs &lt;3	9
1	the latter. the tradition of gendered bathrooms at this point is just self justifying for the sake of tradition. the only functional difference between a woman's bathroom and a mans bathroom is that a few stalls are replaced with a battery of urinals.	9
1	Not even without consent. My nieces birthday was a few months ago and my niece was asking my family for legit make up and high heels. My sister sent an email to everyone in the family explaining that she told her no, but if people wanted to get her clear/sheer lip gloss or cute flats that was fine. Thank you for understanding what I'm hollerin' here. No one is oppressing my niece and her love for makeup.	9
1	That's the beef. She can play dress up until the cows come home, but she is a little person with her own thoughts, opinions and to be honest her own screech when she doesn't get what she wants. It's gonna make my sisters life difficult for no reason.	9
1	Yes, well how DARE she walk around with her VAGINA all EXISTING and stuff.	9
1	Update: the son of a bitch just informed me he's actually married. I would have liked to have known that.    Debating re-activating my profile just do I can screenshot his and send it to his wife who I just found on FB. They have a baby too.	9
1	I immediately thought George Ezra. Lol. I heard him, swooned, did a quick google, and immediately left the computer.	9
1	Damnit now I want a milkshake.	9
1	You're not allowed to be on social media? Honey, you need to get out and take your life back!	9
1	He laughed the whole time he watched it; he knows I've been with a lot of guys and girls and doesn't care in the least. Reason #9182665 I love him!	9
1	I'm always amazed at some of the stories here, where do you find these guys.	9
1	Guess that makes sense never been on any of those sites.	9
1	If you were on work property you can report that because it is completely inappropriate (if you want to anyways). Sorry you work with such a floppy donkey anus.	9
1	Is it George Ezra?  Edit: oops, just saw your other comment!	9
1	See the rest of the thread.  But, yes.	9
1	Damnit now I want a thick cock.   ...and a milkshake.	9
1	Fine print:  * I tried to tell her it was wrong and she needed to stop.  * I don't have access to him or his wife on fb.  * She's the last friend I have from school.	9
1	I may have screamed a little when I got to the baby otters &gt;.&gt;	9
1	Guys!  I figured out what /s means! :D  Aaaaaaaaaaaah!	9
1	I've always wondered, if you photoshop a male's nipple cleanly over the nipples in an image of a topless female, is it still obscene? (probably needs a message at the bottom stating so because men)	9
1	[It hurts, Trolls](http://i.imgur.com/olvOWDm.gif)...	9
1	I just realized how many things thick can mean.  Mindplosion.	9
1	I'm sorry bunny. It's tough having integrity :\	9
1	&gt; a battery of urinals  This is my new band name.	9
1	What's funny is I had been talking to my roommate about how we'd never farted in front of each other before that SAME day. He later told me that he thought he had in front of me, because on two separate occasions when I was sleeping over he farted himself awake.  he's a gem	9
1	This yak describes what I went through yesterday. My professor I work for had an end of the semester party for her TAs an research assistants and our SOs. There was that super artsy soirée music playing, fancy cheeses and spreads and homemade mead. I felt so out of place. Like a child who wandered in on their parents dinner party. I was like why am I here. I am a children	9
1	I turned to my husband a few weeks ago, having taken stock of the paid-for cars, nice little house with a yard that's actually looking like we had a plan, and said, "We've done surprisingly well for a couple of dumb kids."   We're in our 40s. I still seek out advice from older/more experienced people.	9
1	That's still slut shaming. This is about honesty, not sex.	9
1	I'm picky about foundation because cheap brands seem to make me break out. But eye primer plus cheapo colors? Done and done.	9
1	I'm of the opinion that anyone involved in extramarital affairs should be ashamed of themselves.	9
1	Hey cupcakes! If you're buying from Lush, the whole no animal testing, minimal animal byproduct, and safe synthetics in minimal amounts thing is the reason you aren't finding more musky/masculine smells. Occasionally we try our hand at the safe synergetic musk... But it's to make our candy scented holiday shower gel. :S if you're looking for something more earthy and gender neutral try Big Blue, Granny Takes A Dip, and Blackberry (for starters). :) you can also find more interesting scent combos in the bubble bars- they just won't fizz like the bombs.	9
1	[Do you have a drinking problem?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl4plPGRG8o)	9
1	Lol I find that fascinating because people talk about doing that and I'm such a heavy sleeper that the idea of farting myself awake is...weird. I think for me to do that, it would decimate my bed and maybe take out a couple walls. Your SO sounds *adorable*!	9
1	Eh oh!   That made me snicker way too hard.	9
1	I agree. That quote is still slut shaming. It doesn't say anything about extramarital affairs.	9
1	I have one of those in my house right now! ;)	9
1	I had to do this and you know what? It was amazing. Going from a hostile environment with someone who mistreats you to an environment with someone who cares about you was the greatest thing for me. It was a rough split but I relied on my family and one or two close friends and got through it.  Good luck, you gotta take care of yourself :)	9
1	Joey, you ever seen a grown man naked?	9
1	I Know there are some breeds that require bathing, but when I went to look them up this picture showed up first in the images:  http://imgur.com/fKC5ugp	9
1	Yes, how dare she exist with her vagina and breasts! Her mere existence causes men to rape! Because of course she either dressed too slutty or had too much to drink or was being a tease. /s   Major, please die in a supernovæ.	9
1	That should be MAYOR not major. Why my phone thought I wanted to write major instead of mayor is beyond me. Mods? Help a title out?	9
1	But what if your dad and you have the same taste in dudes?  ;)	9
1	&gt; I....I just can't.   That was my immediate reaction. The level of stupidity and naivety is just beyond me. She's a goddamn teenager! She was walking home from *work* at 6:30, which isn't even that late, on a bridge that isn't far from a busy road. But how dare she, right? Obviously the solution is a curfew or maybe even the removal of women from the world altogether. I just don't think we're doing enough to shelter ourselves from psychopaths.	9
1	Thanks ladies. Big blanket fort in the living room! I'll bring cookies. ;~;	9
1	Regular trashcan... alright let me go potty, wipe, removed old product, wrap it up, use one hand to open new product, shoving trash into hand holding soiled product, apply new product with one hand, try and pull up pants and underware one handed, without dropping the handful of trash. All while hoping you wrapped your soiled product enough that it doesn't "leak" onto your hand.  But sure I'll get right onto throwing it away in the proper trash can that's out in the open. Just have a trashcan in the stall, easier on the female and whoever pays the bills.	9
1	I love getting to that stage of a relationship where you can be your natural self.	9
1	Just a hint on the credit card stuff. It's easy to a prepaid one with capital one. Like you put $200 on it then that's your limit. After 6 months of responsible use (less than 30% use every cycle, bill paid on time), my score has gone from 401 to over 600. It isn't great but I'm making my way there. And I've been getting offers for better cards. So for now, that may be best for you to establish yourself, credit-wise.	9
1	I don't think that words means what she thinks it means.	9
1	I don't know many females who actually flush the product. I'm just saying how annoying it is to NOT be able to throw the gunk away as you go. Having social anxiety and thinking someone is going to yell ew at you for seeing anything like that can be pretty stressful.	9
1	That's fucked up, but I'm happy the Salon took your side and I'm proud of you for holding back the beast within. I would have had to hold back from talking some shit like "Actually I did the ones in the crack of my ass" or "I've always wondered if your balls are so droopy at that age that you get shit on them everytime you go".	9
1	For this everyday look, youre gonna need bout 200.  Seriously though, you barely swiped that shadow in your crease and im gonna spend 20 bucks for a pot of it? No thaaaanks	9
1	Ok which end of your boyfriend are we talking about here?	9
1	Still getting that at 57. At some point you just surrender to the fact that age != authority.  There will come a moment, my children, when there is no "other" more knowing or more strong than you and you will step in ....you will make a decision...and you will lead.   Seriously, the first and only time I scared an intruder away from our door I grew the ovaries of a mamma bear. I was never afraid of being alone ever again.	9
1	I hear a sitcom!	9
1	That's exactly how I feel. I'm just so stressed out over so many things, some big and some little, but overall things are going well. But I can't get happy.	9
1	I've been going through anxiety/depression as well! I actually ended up getting on an SSRI and, although not at 100%, I'm almost back to my regular self. I'm planning on starting therapy and exercise soon to see if I can eventually reduce or perhaps get off the meds.  Not saying you need meds, but it worked for me! Also, if you haven't already, head over to /r/anxiety. It's also helped me to get some insight from others in the same situation.  Hugs your away!!!	9
1	I'm honestly just confused as to how this is a good strategy to sell milkshakes.	9
1	Totally; it's in your name, you have to! And his wife deserves to know, *especially* since they have a baby!	9
1	I don't really understand why you have to stop being friends with her because she's making a bad decision that doesn't effect you.	9
1	On the same poster.   YOUR EXCESSIVELY TIGHT VAGINA WON'T BELIEVE  HOW PAINFULLY THICK OUR SHAKES ARE	9
1	Reading this made me wonder if I'm the abuser in my relationship... I wish I didn't have improperly treated ADHD and depression. :/ Sorry about you, OP. I hope you can walk away soon, but I also know how hard it is. My first long-term relationship was with an abusive man and I got into another, that person was even worse.	9
1	Right? At one end that's a bit of an insult. At the other end...well, I guess they need to put vaseline on their shopping list. :p	9
1	I told my husband that I have never wanted him to be less thick than when he goes in for anal.	9
1	The only 'bonus' of paying stupid amounts for all makeup in NZ is all my products are MAC. Because fuck it, I'm not paying $35 for a Maybelline foundation when MAC is significantly better quality.	9
1	I want a milkshake like I want my man; to be appropriately balanced in viscosity and taste fucking good!	9
1	Well, with that much confusion, I'm guessing platypus.	9
1	How did you realize you needed to leave?	9
1	Yeeeaahh.... I've been there with my very Christian sister and it was pretty awkward as well. Side note, I absolutely love that actress in the gif though!	9
1	Haha it was so awkward, I felt like she knew as I just sat there replying, "Yeah, that *is* super weird, I don't know *what* kind of people would do that or *why* people would do that.. *Super* *weird*..."   The answer is me, I am the kind of people that do that, and I was drunk and I didn't care, that's why.  And hey! Me too!	9
1	White, soapy, costs like a dollar, can be consumed through a straw, and is actually worth a few pennies at best?	9
1	A coworker once said, "I'm a good girl, I've never even been in a threeway," and I just snapped back without a second thought and said, "really?! No way! You're missing out!..............oh oops ^well ^I'm ^just ^gonna ^go ^back ^to ^work	9
1	It's pretty much saying, "Fuck it, we're selling ice cream now."  Okay, that's delicious, but it's no longer a milkshake.	9
1	It's really admirable that you were able to face that. I hope things are better for you now.	9
1	They don't have an open relationship? My married friends are poly and they have a baby.	9
1	Barely gets through the straw.	9
1	Seven. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/thick	9
1	No, that's in the yard.	9
1	I cant build us a fort (no hands. I am a tin of rice pudding) but I am sending you internet points and warm, pudding scented thought.	9
1	My university was always pushing the common areas and the library as places to study. I tried it once and it was fucking terrible. There are people everywhere! I couldn't think of a worse place to get work done. They chit chat with you, bump into your chair or desk, even try to flirt with you. We had "quiet rooms" but you could only fit like 10 people in there and this was a public university with thousands.	9
1	I'm graduating from veterinary medical school next week and I'm in contract negotiations for a job as a doctor. My school I wanted to go to the big university wide graduation with all the undergrads in the stadium that lasts all day in the hot sun. I straight laughed in their faces.  I have no time to get shitfaced with youths. I've got adult things to do like eat myself sick with my family at an expensive restaurant.	9
1	Sucking is a worthy struggle.	9
1	That's how she attracted the cock in the first place!	9
1	You basically described my man. Although he cries when I bring it up though...	9
1	Prepare your small cat, OUR PAINFULLY THICK SHAKES ARE COMING	9
1	Funny part about this gif, in the background the tile says ...is sleeping around. Irony.	9
1	You win by because you're moving on. Crying doesn't mean you lost, it means you're human and are therefore the winner.   But I completely understand not wanting to cry, because some people mistake a show of humanity for a show of weakness and they're sorely misguided. You get out there, you look him straight in the eye and tell him that you're no longer in the market for douchebags.	9
1	Even better, it says "my spouse is sleeping around"	9
1	I agree with you about most guys just being totally unaware - my own husband once told me to just run something to the car across a dark carpark at night and he'd wait for me in the supermarket. My issue is his apology sounds *so* stock, *so* scripted, like it only came as a result of the backlash. It shouldn't take that, especially for a man in a position of power.	9
1	Ha! I have a friend like this. She actually brags about swallowing her fiance's cum. Meanwhile I'm both trying not to laugh at her, and sad because I am pretty sure she'd stop talking to me if I told her a fraction of what I'm into.	9
1	Crying isn't weakness. He's already lost. *hug* for you.	9
1	Yes. Please do it.	9
1	Can't tell if bragging or insulting your boyfriend.   I'll assume bragging since he's you're boyfriend lol	9
1	I guy I was talking to on Tinder just linked his instagram feed to it.   ...it's full of pictures of him with his girlfriend and baby.   So a cheater *and* an idiot. At least he was pretty. :/	9
1	i choose to think that that was the first time he dropped the L bomb.	9
1	Makeup is crazy expensive. I had an American friend complain about how she paid nearly 20 NZD for a mascara.  We live at the bottom of the world. We got to import that shit.	9
1	Ladies we all need to huddle together and walk everywhere with at least 10 other women. Basically we are going to start forming kill circles to go out for a walk or to a restaurant. It seems perfectly reasonable. Bring your rocks and pointy sticks and wear comfortable shoes. So help me god if someone wears heels and slows us down!	9
1	I mean [we](http://i.imgur.com/iFMqWGg.jpg) definitely don't look alike that much, but I distinctly remember her coming out of my vagina almost 4 years ago...	9
1	I don't see what "everyday" or not everyday has to do with the brand or price of the makeup. Unless they only make, I don't know, *glitter*, there really is no such thing as a special occasion brand of makeup.  We all have our own economic realities to adjust to. If MAC is out of your budget just stick to all the great drugstore options that are out there.	9
1	People are strange... My daughter looks nothing like me, but her personality is so much like me it is scary... The way she looks and her facial expressions are all from her dad. We're not together anymore, she looks so much like him that I'm really happy that we're still pretty much friends. It would probably be distressing if l hated being reminded of him.	9
1	The world needs more Hey Arnold gifs.	9
1	So, your co-worker is an annoying asshole on purpose? I don't know I am continually amazed at what people think is appropriate to say at work.	9
1	That's basically my situation also, kiddo looks like her dad a lot.	9
1	I feel like she's waiting for me to drop the "I adopted her" bomb or that I'm her stepmom and lying to everybody for 3 years. If you do the math on our ages I had her on the cusp of turning 23, so I'm not sure how many 23year olds are in a place financially to adopt...	9
1	Even if you did adopt her, why is she so........invested in that? Why does it matter to her existence? Your daughter is super cute by the way.	9
1	Others have provided cute animals and fancy formatting with actual useful text in links and stuff. I'm on mobile and I don't do that.  But if this guy is your jam, these might cheer you up.  http://i.imgur.com/7YfFazc.gif  http://i.imgur.com/mGQamX3.gif  http://i.imgur.com/8mzD3ex.gif  http://i.imgur.com/ycPXh6x.gif  http://i.imgur.com/BgPiBqQ.gif  http://i.imgur.com/xmGNDp9.gif  Seriously hope things get better for you soon.	9
1	Hopefully your co-worker does not latch onto some false-memory-of-giving-birth meme. Maybe she is upset she was not personally invited to watch your birthing and feels slighted? I mean how selfish of you to have brought forth a child into the universe and not invited everybody you work with to have like a book club meeting in your delivery room so they could watch.	9
1	We didn't even know each other when I had her. She's a relatively new employee in the last year and a half.	9
1	I MUST BE ONE OF THOSE GOOD BLACK PEOPLE, RIGHT?  FUUUUUUCK THIS.	9
1	Yah I have no idea. She only made the comment about her questioning maternity of my daughter once because I actually got upset and was like "Wth?" but she constantly makes comments especially when I have a new picture up saying "She doesn't look like you." "She must take after her father." "Do people ever make the mistake of thinking you aren't her mom?" It's annoying and I'm always just like "I was there when she was born, won't forget that moment..."  Also thank you! I may be bias, but she is just so darn adorable and beautiful!	9
1	They can say the "N" word! So unfair. Also statistically more likely to be shot by cops and get paid less then white people, but saying the "N" word is true privilege	9
1	I can totally see a resemblance, it might not be huge, but it is definitely there. Your coworker is nuts.	9
1	It's like that word has some horrific background or something!	9
1	http://i.imgur.com/To7y2MT.gif  :D	9
1	She needs some hobbies besides speculating on the origins of her colleagues children. Last year when I still worked nights one of my colleagues went on a pretty strict diet. I was also trying to modify my diet. And because worked nights we brought food from home. But she would aggressively interview everybody about what they brought, she would also do it while we ate and she got fixated on making sure we all ate at the same time. Somehow I got nominated to tell her that nobody wanted to be interrogated about their meals. Not, clearly on the same level as your co-worker's intrusiveness with you but it was annoying.	9
1	Pretty sure thats a symptom of Assholery	9
1	YES.  I do this all the time. Will text a FWB, and then panic and put the conversation on do not disturb and hide my phone from myself.	9
1	Yay I'm not the only one! At the same time though, my friends and I are making plans for the weekend so I NEED to check my phone... Gaaaaaah!	9
1	That's what I thought. She's married and pregnant a second time. She thinks she's all-knowing and every relationship needs to follow a set of certain rules. She's already written off my relationship because we had sex after the 3rd date. She keeps telling me to stop having sex with him or its doomed to fail. In her words: "come on man, you're 27, not 17. You'll learn in time. Just don't complain to me in a few months when you're crying".	9
1	Cry all you want, love. Kick his ass to the curb and cry your heart out. It's better to not bottle up your feels.   I once dumped a man I loved because he was cheating. It really hurts but, it's better to be hurt by the truth than by the lies because the lies hurt more.	9
1	I get this a lot too.  And, like you, the memory of pushing a 7lb beast from my snatch is quite vivid.	9
1	Love this gif! Amazing news fellow troll, have an amazing Friday xo	9
1	Great. Now you've made McFlurrys turn me on.	9
1	For the love of James Earl Jones, why are you being downvoted?	9
1	Almost exactly what happened to me last week. I decided not to tell his wife *because* he has 2 kids and I didn't want to be a homewrecker. I feel bad for not telling her, but I also don't want to meddle in someone else's relationship/marriage..	9
1	[I confess my love for you and you don't love my gross ass back!?](http://i.imgur.com/oNObxMf.gif)	9
1	The do not disturb feature for Iphones is the best ever. You can set one conversation to do not disturb, and you won't get notifications about that particular convo.  Magic.	9
1	But..But...In the movies, whenever someone confesses their love for somebody, that person always feels the same way. What did I do wrong?	9
1	He has lost because he lost you. Crying is having the power to let your emotions flow. Be proud of your strength	9
1	Why would any one think that's okay to ask?	9
1	OP we *need* to know what the thing is. Tell ussssss.	9
1	ugh, what an asshole.	9
1	Crying doesn't really have much to do with him.  You're grieving for the relationship, and the more you let yourself grieve, the faster you can put him behind you.	9
1	Omg I thought I was the only one who did that!!!   It's so silly, but I can't help it! I mean it'd not like he knows whether or not I look at my phone, but...Actually I'm not sure of the logic behind this.	9
1	Friend's boyfriend: Ew people with foot fetishes are weird.  That's revolting.  And so deviant.  (I... *might* be paraphrasing)  Me: Ha!  You sweet summer child, that is not even a drop in the fucking bucket as far as fetishes and kinks go.  Let me list some off and make you so *very* uncomfortable.  Friend: ~*cheers me on while watching her boyfriend's face turn all manner of new expressions of disgust*~  They're... not together anymore.  Thank GOD.	9
1	That sound you hear is me cringing so hard it hurts...	9
1	Girl, you will find a new man who will treat you right! I had to do this a year and a half ago and I thought my life was over. It was just starting. I ended up winning a big scholarship, got a new amazing man, became a Jr lecturer at a university and lost 40 pounds!!!!	9
1	This is awesome.  *I've* never been in a three-way but that is *not* how I woulda said it.  More like "yeah, we've never done that.  Monogamy works really well for us.  And I already know we have better sex than most of the people in this room anyway."  With like the biggest wink and grin ever.	9
1	Thank you very much for saying that. Things are getting better by the day. &lt;3	9
1	Seconded.  What things are you into that she thinks are gross?!	9
1	6:30 isn't exactly night time, and she was just walking home from work. If you've gone a certain route hundreds of times without any issue, what reason would you have to avoid the possibility of a bad thing happening? I drive home from work the same way every day, just because I might get into a wreck doesn't mean I'm going to drive a different way at night.	9
1	Yikes,that sub makes me cringe..	9
1	He can't win because it's not a contest. He's done something douchy has hurt your feelings.   When you hide your feelings from other people, mostly you're hiding them from yourself. That wall you build to hold back the tears will still be there when you approach your next relationship. It's okay to be honest with yourself and cry.	9
1	There is no shame in crying. You aren't crying for what you lost but for what it should have been.	9
1	Hahahaha. We started using poo-pourri in the bathrooms at my office and you can definitely smell it on people for a little while afterwards. The first time I smelled it on someone I thought "well, now I know so-and-so just took a big dump."	9
1	I was not prepared for that last line. Am I insanely sheltered or do people really use the n word in person as often as it appears online?	9
1	If it was an open relationship, he probably wouldn't have hid it like he did.	9
1	Instead of vats of boiling oil poured down on those who attempt to breach the gates of the castle, use menstrual cups of blood and clots.	9
1	UNF. Jason Freaking Mamoa. 😍😍 He can lead my khalasar /aaaanyday/!!!	9
1	Welcome to engineering.... =/  Man, I used to think I was smart until I started engineering!	9
1	When i met him in Indy a while back, he was VERY drunk. Like, the entire time he was in town. :(	9
1	OP PLS. ^^PLS.	9
1	In the office I used to be in, the coworkers were throwing that word around like nothing. This was when the whole Paula Deen thing went down. I was just like wow people wow.	9
1	I, too, keep up with the Kardashians. My boyfriend knows and mocks me relentlessly but I just can't stoppppp. [I just want to be Khloe's friend.](http://media.giphy.com/media/iW5EyLwshToyc/giphy.gif)	9
1	All I did was read "Jason Momoa" and I instinctively started doing Kegels. Ovulation week has got me real hard this month haha.	9
1	This actually works. Some girl dropped an unused tampon in the middle of the hallway back in high school and the boys all walked single file, pressed into the walls around it. It's like a force field, or something.	9
1	Clearly she is talking about his head. ;P	9
1	http://i.imgur.com/qLJGjd3.gif  What the actual fuck?  What makes someone think that's an ok thing to say to anyone, ever?	9
1	Ugh, idk why I do too. Maybe its because I want their lavish lifestyle minus the cameras. Lol. I remember I used to watch the hills, real housewives, the....i should stop typing now.	9
1	Open relationship/poly amorous maybe? Otherwise he is seriously dumb :/	9
1	It's not a part of the culture where I grew up, it makes me so sick to think about that. Can see why it would be an office you used to work at.   Edit: I just wanted to clarify that my reaction to the n word is more about being sensitive to it since I so rarely hear it, like the c word for that matter, which is a result of my culture. Something not being of my culture does not make me intrinsically sick lol.	9
1	Yeah, could you imagine? :D  My mum recently said, in front of both my SO and I, that she thinks sex toys are disgusting, and "why would a person need those anyway?"  ...  My SO didn't say a word, and I made a kind of non-committal noise.   If my mother knew what we do in the bedroom, she'd call an exorcist on us.	9
1	Oh girl. I had this same reaction last week. *To the deep baritone dulcet voice of our Fed Ex guy when he delivered something for our office*  /fans self Need a towel?	9
1	Was thinking about trying that, but guess I'll sick to ye olde room spray.	9
1	Have you done a biology course?	9
1	There is no such thing as a loose vagina. It is a muscle. Think of it like your mouth. You might shove an entire burrito in there and stretch to accommodate but after that, your mouth isn't a wide gaping hole.	9
1	You're not a cheating lowlife, therefore, you've already won.	9
1	I can't stop laughing. Her facial expressions are amazing but the text brings it to a whole new level. The softball one...oh god	9
1	I'm so glad I'm in an office by myself right now. Holy shit, that is hilarious	9
1	-7/10 with rice. Really increased the stale taste and blandness.	9
1	Yeah... I let him have it. Twice during the time I'd known him he told me not to play games. That is all he does. I had been honest to the point of being blunt because he was so insecure and so inexperienced that I wanted to avoid any miscommunication. It was just too much for me though. Nope nope nope.	9
1	If I were this girl, it would take every inch of my will not to send this guy a snapchat video of me getting absolutely plowed by this Alex guy. It would be the perfect burn.	9
1	its astounding how some people cant handle rejection.  i personally never understood this. how can you be mad at someone for liking what they like?	9
1	Sounds like a bad match to me, if you can't get into a gassing competition with your love, what's the point? :-P	9
1	I had to look up 'coal burner' on urban dictionary. What an unclever fuckwad.	9
1	If my Catholic mother found out the horrible things I get up to in the bedroom, I think it would be easier to move country than to ever see her again.	9
1	Does she know how babies are made? She realizes humans don't reproduce asexually, right?	9
1	[Damn, TrollX is on fire today.](http://i.imgur.com/Np0uhQM.gif)	9
1	Uh. She let him down very politely, and he responded by being a twat. She took the high road once, but she's not this dude's emotional caretaker and I think it's absurd you would expect her to continue to be polite after this guy has been insulting her, her relationship, and the dude she's dating.	9
1	I have to disagree. OP made her feelings clear - that she didn't want to pursue a relationship with him-and he responded by disregarding her boundaries and getting pissed about her polite decline of a relationship. At that point she's entitled to tell him to GTFO, in whatever manner accomplishes the goal.  His subsequent meltdown proves her instincts were correct on this one - burn that bridge with fire.	9
1	This girl has better moves than I will ever have.	9
1	Its a burden I bare too....its so hard knowing its so bad but I just can't stop watching. No one knows my secret. No one knows I live for Sunday reruns :((((	9
1	I dont know. She seems to have forgotten what's socially acceptable to say to someone she's only known for three weeks. Well, I mean that's just ridiculous to say to anyone in general.	9
1	It's nobody's job to 'help' this asshat but himself. Women are constantly drafted into that position and/or slammed for refusing it, and, frankly, it's a pain in the ass. However, I agree that the weight comment was uncalled for.	9
1	Jesus fuck dude, how does one go from telling someone they love them to that. What's wrong with people, like this isn't normal right. People like this should be removed from earth, awful as it sounds.	9
1	OMG. That is going to be me later tonight. I cannot wait, and I feel for the man taking me. I hope he can handle it.	9
1	Don't bother with movies. You should only watch anime. If there's one thing anime gets right its human interaction.	9
1	If this lasts until I get home my husband is in for a wild ride tonight.	9
1	He isn't answering fast enough. And then my brain goes into "You're stupid" mode &gt;.&lt;	9
1	Because when you like someone, they're automatically obligated to like you back! That's how life works! /s	9
1	If you're only being nice to someone to get in their pants then YOU are the one leading them on with false promises of friendship.	9
1	When I inquired she explained that he doesn't look/act as wild as I do?????? She's never even met him. And she barely knows me. Yeah, no, my boyfriend actually throws great parties where we stay up until 5am. That's something I haven't done since high school.	9
1	Look, so far as I can tell social norms today are "don't talk to any strangers because God forbid you meet someone" so I think I can safely say I don't understand them and feel pretty good about that.	9
1	Still not entirely clear...	9
1	But seriously, feet are stupid. I mean, you can't do someone in the foot.	9
1	Sounds like my bitch of a mother-in-law.	9
1	Which is good, because I shove burritos in my mouth on the regular. Delicious.	9
1	im listening to [this](https://youtu.be/Mn69LJ0239E?t=2958) right now and shes dancing to it yeaaa   ‎ ‎  ^^^im ^^^drunk	9
1	[Like this?](http://33.media.tumblr.com/35fa03eef45796edc4eaca6d9f3f4062/tumblr_inline_mos2mvcFNt1qz4rgp.jpg)	9
1	And chocolate ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)	9
1	If she's friends on social media I'd unfriend her.  And be really blunt otherwise.  "Yes, you said that before. Do you have a point?"  "You are literally the only person who ever brings this up.  And you do it again and again and again. It's really getting tiresome, could you please just stop?"	9
1	It might be somewhat inappropriate, but it seems like a harmless joke to me. You know her better though, is she the type to make jokes like that?  Why did you have to give up those things btw?	9
1	Why is "coal burner" making it's way back into common lexicon?	9
1	Context? You mean like the century+ that the word has been used as a derogatory insult and way to dehumanize and demean a group of people to support their systemic oppression?	9
1	Cinnabon.  Cinnabon solves all pain.  Cinnabon loves you and always will.	9
1	*But why??*	9
1	Penis. We're talking about penis.	9
1	Yup, looks about right!    (^yeah^no^(:-/))	9
1	The word SJW is a little bit like the nose of a crocodile peeping out from the water, by itself it doesn't look like much, but you know under the surface there's something really fucking unpleasant.	9
1	Let's be clear, there's a clear distinction of intent [and understood meaning] when a hard 'r' is used.   &gt;Before i get bukaked with insults, I understand the word's origins and if it offends you then tough titty, it wont make me stop saying it.   Then you're underestimating the power of a word.	9
1	It was awkward before I realized there were 3 pictures. Then I started scrolling and realized I didn't have any facial muscles left to cringe with...	9
1	so thick that everybody in the room is so uncomfortable	9
1	I know this comment came from an angry place, but reading it I just laughed so hard (not at you, just at the statement!)	9
1	Maybe because men are typically conditioned to believe that they can have whatever they want if they just want it badly enough  Entitled and gross imo	9
1	I've never heard it before. What does it mean?	9
1	Flex your butt! Kind of how it's hard to sneeze with eyes open, it's hard to cry wth butt flexed. Don't really know why	9
1	Wow I made it half way through before the physical discomfort stopped me.  That has to be one of the most racist things I've ever read.	9
1	I'm going to start telling her I cloned her in the basement, I just may have used the wrong DNA. Always mixing that shit up...	9
1	Hey, he gave you a role in the script of his life and you fucked it up. Didn't you know your lines? You really missed out...	9
1	Sorry you're being downvoted.  While I agree with you about the OP's unnecessary comments about the creeper's weight, your point would probably go down better if you made it clear that you don't draw equivalence between their behavior and don't expect her to coddle his feelings beyond refraining from taking non-sequitur pot shots at his appearance.	9
1	I thought I was in /r/childfree the whole time... I thought this was about how your boyfriend was too thick to understand that you want a vasectomy. Holy shit im dumb	9
1	Intent doesn't matter as much as you think it does.	9
1	&gt; learn not to take everything so seriously   Sorry, but racist language *is* serious. Don't say it. Find another word to use please, you aren't funny or endearing, you only think you are. I've heard people say *exactly* the same shit about "faggot" and "tranny" too. Those words can fucking HURT. And when you use them, you never know who it is you're hurting. Not everybody is willing to single themselves out for the sake of correcting your offensive language.	9
1	So far the way I've seen it used in posts in here/niceguys/creepypms is a way to describe someone who dates/has sex with a black dude. There are even men who won't date a woman who's been with a black dudes before.  I had no idea I could "ruin" women with my perfectly average penis.	9
1	Me too. I have to admit [this was the first thing I thought of](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/99/f7/b1/99f7b176ee31cfabce32da6296ad6ada.jpg)	9
1	You can't do someone in the hand either, but we make it work.	9
1	Gawwwd, I'm still kinda shocked from a recent visit to some old friends... We're all 22-24 and one girl whom i had thought was fairly sexually liberal told a story. She said a recent fling of hers mentioned that his ex occasionally put a finger in his ass.  Her reaction to this news was "that's disgusting, I couldn't sleep with him after that and it totally changed my perspective of him as a person".  I'm ashamed to say I sat there too scared to loose a friend by challenging that. You think you know someone ey? Real bummer (lol).	9
1	It's amazing. Seriously. Rooms sprays mask. This hides that shit.	9
1	He'd probably just masturbate to it. If I did that I'd feel really icky knowing he'd seen me naked or partially naked. *shudder*	9
1	Total side note but it irks me that when a woman says she's not interested, it's never enough of a reason. So women say that they have boyfriends because another man will more likely respect the man she's dating rather than her own wishes. I know he didn't respect the other guy either - I just hate that "I'm not interested" isn't enough of a reason	9
1	OK, if true, what does that ultimately mean? That this woman should swallow her feelings and just let him be an asshole to her? That makes no sense. If he 'needs someone to hate' she might be doing him a favor by refusing to let him get away with it.	9
1	I think it is someone whos dating a black person publicly (or secretly, I can't decide...). It probably comes from the fact that if you're heating your home with coal (which is probably a sign of poverty) you can have black stains on your hand, which is giving it away.	9
1	Oh please. As if you didn't make a comment advocating the use of the N word specifically to start drama. We all can clearly see you did and your false modesty now claiming you don't want to respond to someone who "nitpicks" your pot stirring comment isn't fooling anyone.	9
1	You learn something new everyday. Maybe something vile, that you have no use for, but still, something.	9
1	Sorry I got distracted by how cute she is. What's the issue here?	9
1	I thought of [this](http://www.farmcollector.com/~/media/Images/FCM/Editorial/Articles/Magazine%20Articles/2012/03-01/What%20Goes%20Around%20Comes%20Around%20Cook%20Stoves%20Enjoy%20Resurgence/FC-0312-ballard-p4020927.jpg)	9
1	"I would spit on you, but I don't want to turn you on."	9
1	Works in the office too. When I want my (male) bosses to stay out my desk drawers to rummage for office supplies, I put a few tampons at the front of the drawer. Works like a charm!	9
1	Keep trying! If you tell them 10395723810 more times, show up outside their house every day, stalk them at work, and shower them with inappropriate gifts, they'll definitely fall for you.	9
1	I do my daily neutral look with 70% high end products. I use what works for me and sometimes that isn't a $5 eyeshadow (sometimes it is tho, hi NYX!), sometimes it's a $30 one. *shrug*.	9
1	Right, we do so by isolating them from society.	9
1	I don't understand the "with rice" thing. Why do people say that?	9
1	Life will be so much better now!  This sounds just like the 8 year marriage I had in my 20's.  It took awhile to deprogram myself..  but it's all a fuzzy faded memory now and life is better than I could have imagined for myself.  And some good comes out of these terrible relationships ya know, because we learn what we will never ever put up with again, and we also learn just how strong we are for getting out because that's the hardest part.  Then you can channel that strength into something awesome!!  I am really happy for you!  Breathe easy and be yourself!  &lt;3	9
1	So when men lash out at women, we should quietly walk away. Why couldn't this guy do the same thing when she politely declined? Before it got ugly on either side?	9
1	No, we change social trends by calling a spade a spade. Except in this case is calling an asshole an asshole.	9
1	There was a thread where they were listing foods that "would be better over rice" or something like that. Some guy went off and tried all the combinations and would rate them out of 10.	9
1	Check out the top post of all time in /r/askreddit.  It's a post about a guy trying foods recommended by Redditors with rice.  Then he rates the experience.	9
1	"I will nut-punch you so hard you will smell colors" oh fuck I'm dying	9
1	that disappointed me. Not so much sassy as just asshole :(	9
1	Yeah, my best friend's parents were among the first black kids at integrated schools and they had the n word hurled at them regularly and very hatefully, including death threats.    But somehow she's supposed to ignore that and just be like, "haha that's cool, I won't let it bother me!"	9
1	Back problems are just really, really hot.	9
1	I wasn't either. I didn't even know what some of that meant, but I think that's for the best.	9
1	Well, maybe not anywhere near his level. Well ok orders of magnitude away from his level. Ok to be fair she was rude and he was a disgusting racist sexist piece of shit with boundary issues and a sense of personal manifest destiny that belongs two centuries back right along with the rest of his shit. Yea, they were completely different.	9
1	[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2np694/what_tasty_food_would_be_distusting_if_eaten_over/)  There's an entire subreddit dedicated to it - /r/withrice	9
1	Guys "get" the girl in movies and stories and all that when they "prove" their love, whereas girls are "won."  It's a weird trope when you think about it for a second.	9
1	And then the asshole keeps being an asshole.	9
1	Agreed. They have similar face shapes.	9
1	Depends on the person. My father and stepmother would regularly say "I'm not your N*****" when referring to housework and things and often it's used by shitty white kids trying to sound cool.	9
1	I'm sure there's men out there that have a fetish for crawling up in between them. Actually that doesn't sound too bad as a woman. But it just looks unnecessary.	9
1	You have what looks like the exact same chin, both have brownish eyes, both white...I've definitely seen parents and children who look much less like each other.	9
1	Oh lord, I was playing Never Have I Ever when drinking with some friends and one of the more squeamish/judgemental people in the group said "Never have I ever done anal", me and two others drank and the looks we got!	9
1	You didn't even respond to the right comment.    I don't think you're very bright.	9
1	No, him winning would be you staying with him, meaning he gets multiple girls. You're winning.	9
1	definitely feel you! I don't drink or smoke, and don't use tampons or makeup. I'm also in a serious long term relationship and live with my partner so I'm not dating and don't have to deal with LDR problems. you're not alone here!	9
1	I am trying to hold back my laughter at my desk so badly I've started crying. Her face! Jesus!	9
1	This is awesome. I feel like it would just leave me with an unfortunate combination of ugly pre-cry face and tight cheeks, tho.	9
1	Came here to say this.  I need to step up my game.   Gonna practice her moves tonight.	9
1	"Why won't girls at least friend zone me like they do all my buddies! Honest guys finish last! "	9
1	The thing is, you be polite to those kind of people, they'll take it as an in. They won't leave you alone. Best thing to do is to either ignore (often doesn't work) or insult.	9
1	Nooooo.  Why would you want to think about this gross guy while fucking?  And then let the gross guy see you naked?  Snap chats aren't exactly secure you know, so you'd basically be giving him revenge porn.	9
1	I'm talking about his thick penis. Its painful when he tried to fuck my ass	9
1	I wonder if I have ever been that happy?	9
1	What was so arousing about it?	9
1	I've experienced things like this too; the moment they realize they won't ever be able to win you over, they just have to start insulting you in order to justify for themselves that you weren't worth their time anyway.	9
1	Haha, oh god, that is a great analogy. The funny part is that it came up because I told him about a guy who actually made a living on social media by posting crappy memes &amp; stuff, getting popular and then getting paid by sponsors to promote their crap. His response was he wouldn't want to deal with the SJWs... .wait what? THAT is the first thing you think of?	9
1	You're not alone! Don't really care for drinks, am a virgin, and haven't dated since middle school so I lack all sorts of flirting skills. :3	9
1	Woooow, you didn't just dodge a bullet, you missed an artillery strike.	9
1	I totally agree.  They won't take "no" for an answer, it has to be "I'm taken".  And sometimes they won't accept that either.  "I don't see him/her here".	9
1	But why *oh why* was a woman at work in the first place?! Don't women just belong in the kitchen, where they're safe and busy making sandwiches?   I don't want to live on this planet anymore.	9
1	That is some pure backhanded evil.  "He's way too good of a guy for a foul skank like you.  He must have a  better woman on the side."	9
1	Oh my god, if you all have mutual facebook friends, you should post this conversation to your wall, uncensored and just let it be known he's a racist and gross.	9
1	tell me I'm pretty!	9
1	oh no i opened this at work :I	9
1	People shouldn't buy homes because it's just asking to get robbed	9
1	A totally accurate representation of the female body.	9
1	What does that mean? The words "meh, " have," "a," "nice," "day," what do those all mean? You said words mean different things for you than the rest of society, so when you wrote those words what did you mean?	9
1	&gt; It's just come out that the girl's allegation was false.  Oh shit, here comes the MRA horde...	9
1	Oh I didn't think for a second that it was anything other than a penis innuendo. I'm just shocked at how people didn't get it.... maybe *they're* painfully thick (NOTE: that one wasn't about a penis)	9
1	What I like in this sub is process, more than content.  I kinda wish less of our conversations were about periods for example, but that's likely because at my age they are such old news to me.  What keeps me coming here is the atmosphere of respect and empathy.	9
1	I'm just waiting for *cough* trying to create *cough* an opportunity so I can say this!	9
1	Oh I'm absolutely sure that this is *someone's* fetish.    In theory, crawling up into those mammoth fun bags seems like it'd be great, but the longer I think about it, the more I realize I'd just be drowning in tit sweat.  I mean, could you even breathe in there?  I have so many questions.	9
1	Thank you for writing this response! I think it's important for people to realize that just because they're not aware of it doesn't mean it's not happening.   The n word isn't relevant in Alaska the same way as the rest of the US, but it's true people definitely do use it more than I've explained. I've never heard it used seriously in person. Granted I'm not black, but I am a WOC that passes for white and I've experienced more than enough second hand racism for lifetime. Totally anecdotal, but I was hoping to hear about more experiences like yours.	9
1	Oh man can you even imagine how strong a person would have to be to carry those things around??	9
1	I don't know what it means and I'm afraid to search it	9
1	If they don't want to find those things out, they shouldn't be playing that game in the first place.	9
1	&amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;	9
1	Your question just immediately got the troll song from Frozen stuck in my head. Ah being a mother makes me super cool.	9
1	This gave me a good laugh, thanks :)  Also, I live in the south and never heard the derogatory term "coal-burner" before.  Was he just shooting from the hip or is that a common slur?	9
1	It's so racist it's basically illegible. Like I can't understand half of what it's saying because it's just random slurs	9
1	Despite living in the south (Arkansas) I really thought it was sort of an isolated problem.  My parents certainly never used it, or said anything racist, nor did any of their friends.  I remember one incident when I was in 8th grade where a kid made a derogatory comment about the way the black people smell.  It was like a huge deal and he got suspended.  But that was really my only experience with racism until then.  I'd never even heard the N word except for on TV or whatever until I started taking my niece places and occasionally someone would call me a "nigger lover."  It was a shock to me.	9
1	Oh! I like those...	9
1	It sounds incredibly old school to me. Like from the time coal was a thing. But I'm from the West coast so I'm pretty naive about Southern racism	9
1	Only us women would see the potential downsides to it.  Imagine the crumbs that fall into her cleavage!	9
1	[Cooter contempt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Womb_and_vagina_envy)	9
1	I come here for the humorous posts related to sex and/or embarrassing moments.  I haven't had a period in over a year; am married; and don't agree with any of the political posts.  Sex and awkwardness though, I can totally relate, or at least get a good laugh.	9
1	That was brave of you.  I can't pretend to condone your actions, but I admire your courage.  ;)	9
1	Like really really big pillows. I'm often jealous I don't get to lay my head on my boobs like my husband does. But I have 24 hour access so I guess I win.	9
1	My mother says the same thing. I thought she was the only one!	9
1	I think these are even more hilarious to me because I haven't read any Jane Austen books.	9
1	He'd probably take it totally the wrong way.  He'd definitely get tons of wrist workouts from the vid and since you sent him "nudes" you clearly return his undying love.  Alex is clearly the problem, he won't let us be together... must kill Alex... Then we can be together   Dude seems unbalanced.  Less interaction with him the better. "Living well is the best revenge."	9
1	Or in the case of OP, they won't accept "I'm taken" because "I don't like the guy you're dating, so you shouldn't be dating him."	9
1	I would just send a screenshot of the conversation to his mother.	9
1	Clearly this is why we all congregate here--land of period shits and cat gifs.	9
1	My mom does it too. I'm still not sure if she's always been racist or if saying shit like that is just a part of her personality disorder.	9
1	So that's why she's not answering... I feel better now, thanks.  ^^^^I ^^^^reject ^^^^your ^^^^reality ^^^^and ^^^^substitute ^^^^my ^^^^own.	9
1	Right? And how cocky and just... Delusional of him to say that he refuses to believe that one person can have feelings for someone without them feeling the same way back. It's like he tried to counter "I'm not interested" as a response before she could even say it.	9
1	I didn't know either but I chanced it. "Social Justice Warrior"	9
1	I wouldn't actually send him a video. It's just one of those things you imagine doing in your head.	9
1	HE'S SO BIG. WHEN I MET HIM HE MADE THE COFFEE CUP HE WAS HOLDING LOOK LIKE AN ESPRESSO SHOT. LIKE HOLY SHIT. OK IM DONE.	9
1	She needed them to actually shovel real coal to get the party boat away from the port police. It's a scene from the pilot of Arrested Development--if you've never watched that show, you *have* to! It's amazing!  And that group of guys is recurring: [The Hot Cops](http://arresteddevelopment.wikia.com/wiki/Hot_Cops)	9
1	The power of Playtex compels you!	9
1	I'm ovulating AND seeing Avengers tonight with my SO. May the night be wild for both of us!	9
1	Ah, i think it might be a bit cruder than that. You know the saying "a bun in the oven"? Extrapolate.	9
1	Yeah. I don't drink or anything, and although I do wear makeup I've never been in a relationship at all, and I can't use tampons- but I do love lurking where people are talking about stuff I can't experience. It makes me feel like I'm missing out on less. You get to learn a lot!	9
1	Hold me closer, tiny dancer!	9
1	I couldn't tell you which of the guys was my favorite!	9
1	Dick pics it is then	9
1	I'd let you ruin me   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)	9
1	I can almost picture the neckbeard who wrote it after m'lady coldly rejected him; red-faced and frothing at the mouth, trembling with rage, like a block of jell-o during an earth quake, as his chubby fingers furiously hammer out this barely coherent string of racial slurs.	9
1	Oh damn, I hadn't even considered the cleavage crumbs!  So *if* someone crawled in there, it'd potentially be a hot, sweaty, grainy skin-prison.	9
1	&gt; I realize I'd just be drowning in tit sweat. I mean, could you even breathe in there?   I don't know about anybody else, but when I get crazy boob-sweat, my tits smell like a fresh roll of sourdough. So...maybe not.	9
1	A lot of these hit a little too close to home... Oh my god, do I actually live in a victorian novel and just not know it?	9
1	I know, right?! It was hilarious the look on their faces when my flatmate asked a really pointed question ("Never have I ever done a nude photoshoot", knowing full well that we both did one together and would have to drink P:); all the other girls except those two wanted to see the pictures and said they were really proud of us!	9
1	Thanks for taking that bullet	9
1	&gt; In the end, it took hearing myself make all the same excuses that my mother used to make about my stepfather to really force me to realize that what I was experiencing was abuse.  Good for you. That level of self-awareness is incredibly difficult. You got this.	9
1	Yeah, because being an entitled, racist, asshole is going to make her want to date you. Brilliant!	9
1	Wait, wait, wait, hold the phone a minute here.  So you're telling me I'm NOT the only person whose tits smell like a bakery on hot days?	9
1	What is SJW? I don't even want to investigate.	9
1	I think it's ok to cry when someone hurts you, I totally understand the urge to act cool but he should know he's a bellend, that actions have consequences and that he hurt you. He'll regret it someday.	9
1	I don't know, I can't think of a clearer way to say ***"I'm not attracted to you, so STOP!!!"***	9
1	OR you could enjoy some great sex.   Your call for how you want to live life.	9

1	This is exactly what Jacob does to Bella in Twilight. The only difference is that she was attracted to him, but she had made her feelings and wishes more than clear.  Fucking hate those movies. They romantacize every abusive behavior in the book. Dismantling someone's transportation to control where they go, speaking to someone in gruff commands (he literally just says "Come Bella" at least once. Like she's a dog), telling someone that they don't know what they really want and only you know what's good for them, and yea, threatening violence: all abuse.	9
1	I wish I had gold to give you	9

1	Social Justice Warrior, means different things to different people.   Largely it seems to be mean "a person with views to the far left of me", on reddit it is used most often with "radical" feminisim, the HAES/fat acceptance movement and the weird parts of certain Tumblr communities	9
1	I just gagged. My ex boyfriend would brag about how persistent he was and how he 'won' me over. He was also the type of guy who thought he was a 'nice guy'. In reality, he asked me out over and over again, refused to believe I didn't like him like that, turned all our friends against me, and followed me around until I finally gave in. I felt like something was wrong with me for not liking a guy who was so 'nice' to me, and who tired so hard to 'win' me over. But now I realize that he was an asshole who basically bullied me into dating him.	9
1	I don't get it either. When I asked a friend of mine out years ago and told her how I felt, I asked if she felt the same way about me. She said no. And that's a perfectly good answer. I don't get why people can't accept that.	9
1	For future reference just tell them you're not interested in them specifically. Not that you have a bf or you're not looking to date at the moment or whatever, just that you're not interested in them.   If you tell a guy you have a boyfriend then he might think you're interested but the problem is you have a bf at the moment. Same thing with "I'm not looking for a relationship". To some guys that just means "let me find a way to make you interested in a bf".   This way you nip it in the bud right there.	9
1	Attractive people doing sexy hero things.	9

1	Here. I hope you choke on this upvote, I just gagged a little.  I'll be over in /r/EyeBleach.	9
1	Basically someone not bigoted enough for the person using the term.  Like.. "Oh you don't like it that I called someone a slur or make fun of rape?  Fuckin SJWs ruining everything."	9
1	Just let it go OP.	9
1	I think often times a lot of guys don't know how to pivot in a conversation.  Coupled with the idea that they've completely disregarded the possibility that the other person isn't interested and you get this situation here. They're left flat footed and cornered animals tend to lash out.  Being able to show confidence when someone says no and continuing with pleasant conversation is a skill that a lot men aren't taught. That and learning to be comfortable dancing.	9
1	&gt; Delusional of him to say that he refuses to believe that one person can have feelings for someone without them feeling the same way back.  It's also incredibly narcissistic and disrespectful.   "MY emotions nullify you as an adult capable of making your own choices. My emotions automatically dictate yours."	9
1	&gt; men whose index and ring fingers are similar in length tend to be nicer to women.  [Perhaps, but on the other hand...](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/MensHealth/penis-size-linked-finger-length/story?id=13999229)	9
1	Apparently someone who is extremely liberal when it comes to social issues. When used as an insult, it usually just means "fuck you, person nicer than me!"	9
1	Right though?! Right?! My jaw was hanging by the end of that.	9
1	Or you could play "Let's Shame the Racist" and post it with his name not blocked out if you want to really play dirty...	9
1	can we get a summary?	9
1	I'm glad that my sister is as open-minded (i.e. as much of a perv) as I am. Our mom thinks we're prudes because we blush whenever she brings up the pleasurable, non-procreative side of sex...but then we show off our purchases after a shopping trip at the local feminist sex store and have frank dialogues about lube and stuff.   I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to know about the shit I've done (and likewise) but I know that she won't label it as gross or weird, so we're cool.	9
1	No, you're not.  And the worst part about this smell is knowing *why* it happens, which is that bacteria and yeast are trying to start fermenting in the dank, dark, humid oven that is your cleavage/underboob.  Just thinking about it makes me need to go take a shower	9
1	Yup. Monogamous, straight, fairly light drinker, mostly light periods.  Love the crowd though. At the end of the day, we're all just trolls.	9
1	I always thought "not interested" to be the best reason. Reasons like "I'm not ready to date right now" are much more disappointing because they make it sound like it could have worked if it was a different time. At least with "not interested" it's like "Okay, well that's just the way it is".	9
1	But he was an idiot to even ask in the first place. He knows she's in a serious relationship, so the fact that he even thought it was worthwhile to tell her how he felt - let alone think that she'd actually say yes to him - is absurd. Plus why isn't it enough to just say "I don't have feelings for you" in the first place?   Also he clearly *doesn't* accept or respect that she's in a relationship, so I don't know where you got that from.	9
1	I totally agree. I really wish we'd focus on the horrible things fedoras like this guy do rather than mocking them for their appearance. I get that it's cathartic sometimes and I'm not saying by any means that they don't deserve rudeness,  but if we're just perpetuating other forms of oppressive behaviour when we're calling out oppressive behaviour, that doesn't achieve much imo	9
1	you have the same mouth/chin/cheeks...I see the resemblance. I bet it will get stronger as she gets older. Not that it matters, because wtf? Who cares if she is or isn't biologically yours, and what business is it of hers? I swear, the things people think are their business are BIZARRE.	9
1	I wish you could have sent him [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/4OVPA.jpg), I immediately thought of it reading the first message	9
1	When my SO and I first started dating I got my period. I felt kind of awkward about it because everything was new and this was just added stress. I told him I was cramping one night while cuddling and he just straight up offers to go out and get me pads or tampons. Whichever I preferred. So he did. And it was awesome. I'm usually not the kind of person to hide their period. I have no problem asking for pads out loud. I don't hide them when I walk to the bathroom. I dream of a world where I'm not shunned because my uterus is having a "no baby party"	9
1	Tbh when I'm personally hurt by a word, I rarely bother correcting their language because if they'll speak like that with out even thinking - am I stepping up as a target? Not worth my time - and I mean because I immediately think the person is trash if they use hurtful words lightheartedly or to be funny.  Call outs are hard sometimes. Which is why it's helpful for people who aren't directly affected by the said word to do the calling out.	9
1	She makes the comments so nonchalantly, like she's saying the complete opposite statement. Like how normal people gush over how much a child looks like a parent. Maybe it's normal for her to tell people how different people look... I should stop trying to justify her crazy.	9
1	i have never, ever sniffed my hand after a handshake. What is this even?	9
1	Apparently my babies have some black features (?) and I have been asked multiple times in hushed tones if they are "mullato". I'm in California, after the first time I've just replied with a cold stare and "is there a problem?" It probably wouldn't irk me so much if they weren't acting so hush hush and using such a loaded term.	9
1	I respect that you want everyone to treat each other politely, but please understand that your standards are not everybody's standards, and that you don't have any right to expect other people to uphold them. Different people will have different thresholds and reactions when encountering shitty behavior; it doesn't have to be your thing anymore than being polite has to be theirs.	9
1	Just start coughing, no one will let you hold it then.	9
1	Back problems = massages.  Massages = sex.  The math checks out.	9
1	Like displaying a picture is somehow an invitation to discuss the resemblance. So strange...  My mom walked into a bookstore once, and the clerk looked up and said "your kids are in the back." She was like "how did you know they were mine?" And he looked at her like she was insane and said "they look just like you!"   Technically, I look more like our dad, and my brother looks more like our mom, but it's pretty subtle. People would ask us if we were twins when we were younger.	9
1	Soooooo.......is your hand pregnant now? He's just so stupid gorgeous I wanna slap his face....	9
1	To sum it up, it's a slur for a (rich?) white girl who dates black guys to piss her parents off.	9

1	"Oh no the pigments!"	9
1	Others have described what it means well. Just to add this, I see it used a LOT as a combined ad hominem / strawman attack, designed to shut down any argument or discussion that is pro-equality, and make a person look like they are hysterical or crazy.  Kinda like dumping a bucket of paint on someone then telling them they are wrong because they are covered in paint.  It's used a lot by people who have a blanket-hatred for feminism.	9
1	Just try to imagine the most racist things someone could possibly come up with in their wildest imagination to say about a white woman who dates a black man.  Then realize that whatever you just imagined isn't half as fucked as what the actual urban dictionary definition says because there's no way you're as racist as whoever wrote it.	9
1	C2E2? I had really wanted to go to that knowing he was there. I was so jealous when one my friends got to meet him and he whispered "moon of my life" in Dothraki into her ear sexily. I would have literally died.	9
1	ugh right when I think we've progressed as a culture... people go saying stuff like this.	9
1	Yeah, and her dad high fiving Jacob when she breaks her hand punching his face? What the fuck! Your daughter felt threatened enough to use violence, and you are like "lols gg dude"?!	9
1	My friend was at Walmart. Some dude kept eyeing her in a creepy way while she was shopping. He then went up to her and told her he thought she was beautiful and asked her number. She flat out said "I'm not interested."  His reply: "I thought girls were supposed to be nice."  Her: "Nope. Bye."  Him: "Bitch."  Yepppppp. Even if telling them in the most straightforward way, you get called names and the anger escalates quickly.	9
1	I may or may not have a volcano on an island in international waters.	9
1	The initialism "SJW" stands for "Social Justice Warrior." It's a derogatory term applied to people on social media who complain about, highlight, or bring up social issues. The term is generally applied to people on Tumblr who complain about misogyny and homophobia (esp. transgender related). MRAs, who do the same thing, but with reddit and the oppression of white men, are somehow different.	9
1	"Not all of it. Just the pegging."	9

1	Apparently "proud white man w/ a big cock"   That's literally the name the author of that entry chose.	9
1	It's like an MRA, but one who complains about misogyny and homophobia, instead of how oppressed white men are.	9
1	yeah he was only like 14 or something, probably one of the best things that ever happened on the internet	9
1	There's always going to be some idiot holding us back.	9
1	This happened to me last time I went out. Some guy wanted to dance with me and wouldn't accept my "no," so I told him I have a boyfriend but he was like "that's okay it's just a dance" and just grabbed me and started dancing with me. Then with another guy I immediately said I have a boyfriend and he was like, "where is he?" Ugh.	9
1	Ooohhhh, that IS majestic. Also not a coal burner. My grandmother has an almost identical stove, which burns wood. I guess you could probably burn coal in it too though, but coal roasted turkey is kinda gross.	9
1	Take a hint, dude. I struggle to understand why guys do this. It sucks if you like someone a lot and they don't feel the same, I've been there, but getting angery about it baffles me. I dont think I'll ever understand why that happens. I know feelings can really drive a person to do something, but think for Gods sake!	9

1	Haha, yeah, it's this thing they call 'Findings'. They're random facts strung together in what's supposed to create a comedic effect.

Super funny though: http://harpers.org/departments/findings/	9
1	Was this her first time ever first time, or just your first time being together?  Was she in pain? If it was her first time, there might be a little pain, but lots of lube and gentleness should ease it.  You might want to talk to her first and communicate well rather than talk to us.	9
1	Preaching to the choir. I'm terrified of babies. Well, terrified of what I might accidentally do to them. I'm SUPER clumsy, and as much as people pish and posh the idea, me dropping a baby is a VERY real possibility. And there's no coming back from that. There's no appropriately-sized muffin basket for breaking a coworker's baby.	9
1	"Why isn't this piece of shit working?" - that one got a literally lol.	9
1	Yeah that's another issue altogether but at least you can jump right to that part and skip the "well I'm better than your boyfriend" nonsense.	9
1	"I would spit on you, but I don't want to turn you on."  I really need to start up a list of insults I'd really like to use against people, but will never remember in time to do so.	9
1	Yes! Me too! Everyone always laughed when I didn't want to hold a baby, like I was making a joke.   I really don't. Not only do I know I'd drop the thing and it wouldn't land properly, like a cat, but I'm pretty sure they don't have souls yet.	9
1	And when you check back hours later and there's no reply... fuuuuuckk	9
1	I don't drink, and I definitely don't have sex (often) as I'm in a LDR.  I think what I like about this sub is the fact that no matter *what* I'm dealing with, someone can relate to me, and, even if they can't, they are supportive.	9
1	I HATE the "where is he?" line. Maybe I prefer going out with my friends, maybe he's out somewhere else, maybe he doesn't like going out, *why should it matter*????	9
1	Hell, you could probably drop a whole ham in there. Mmm...surprise ham.	9
1	We've got an utter bellend of a tory at the moment and the Labour candidate is pretty good.	9
1	Me too!!! Which is really weird, because I have ferrets and I'm totally fine picking them up and walking around with them despite the fact that they are doing everything in their power to wriggle out of my arms and onto my head/down my arm/into thin air. But quiet, perfectly still babies? No thanks.	9
1	I wonder if you could somehow harvest that and make boob beer.  And I just grossed myself out.	9
1	"Mullato? What's that? Some kind of dessert? It sounds delicious. Is it like Gelato?"	9
1	&lt;.&lt; &gt;.&gt; ^^Hello ^^Brother	9
1	Thats not the original OP. This is a cross post.	9
1	Just stopping by to compliment your flair. One of the best I've seen. xD	9
1	[Telling a guy you're not interested isn't enough. You need to be physically accompanied by another man. Because, the only thing creepy dudes respect is other dudes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4OaY87rJq4)	9
1	TO BE FAIR there is definitely a SJW type that is...too much. There are people who use social justice as a way to be a "special snowflake" by supporting every extremist cause, talking about it nonstop, actively trying to be "the socially aware one" in any group, and being essentially militant about projecting their extreme views. Those are the SJWs that are truly a problem. BUT a lot of people use the term derogatively for anyone who bothers to be politically correct.	9
1	Exactly!   I had a guy propose to me (in India)*, and he wanted a reason why I said no.  Every reason I gave, he kept counter-arguing why that wasn't a good reason.   Finally, I just said, 'This isn't a negotiation. This is a no. Whether you get it or not, I am NOT INTERESTED.'  I think I probably should have just started with that...   *I was nice enough to be polite to him and say hi when we passed on the sidewalk. That means we're in love, right?	9
1	If someone annoys you they annoy you.  But I just fail to see how even then these people are more of a problem than the openly bigoted people pretty much everywhere.	9
1	*Thanks* Obama! For like serious and literal this time.	9
1	He is so delightfully tan in person. I secretly wondered if he tasted like a cinnamon latte.	9
1	dude (used metaphorically, in case you're female), if you're hesitant to talk about this with people, is posting about it on reddit the best decision?	9
1	Dunk her in the water see if she floats....no wait, thats witches!	9
1	And then, [MRW he gets the all-clear](http://i.imgur.com/vQxCR.gif)	9
1	Thanks so much trolls, you gals are the best. I dumped a bag of his stuff at his feet, told him I couldn't be with someone who cheated and told him to have a nice day. Walked away with BO$$ by Fifth Harmony playing in my head, feels good. Your support is much appreciated &lt;3	9
1	Well I guess that's enough book learnin' for me today. *^puts ^feet ^up*	9
1	THANK YOU. Sometimes I feel like I have to scream this at people. Like, I should be able to fucking meet someone without "SO WHEN DO WE FUCK?" being the default.	9
1	"What's your man got to do with me?"	9
1	Awesome! Are you going to switch to bareback now or keep the latex flowing?	9
1	I never get tired of "boiled rice with ice, ended up with rice. 10/10"	9
1	I gagged.  Take your upvote and go.	9
1	Shaking his hand was like being hugged by a big beautiful bear claw ham uuuuggggghhh.	9
1	Bareback, in 90 days or so. Sticking with condoms until then (once he heals up). I can't wait!	9
1	I love how there are no other comments, just you sitting here with all of the upvotes. It was THAT good.	9
1	Sexism clusters drizzled with rape apologism.	9
1	I once said to a guy trying to rub his body up against me in a club (I was clearly just dancing with my friends), "I'm engaged." He said "yeah, but are you actually going to marry him?".  [MRW](http://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MaryPoppinsIll.gif)	9
1	I completely agree, I did cringe a bit at the overweight part as well, just didn't sit well with me.	9
1	I like to hang out in my room on weekends and watch Daredevil and drinking Mt. Dew. [Oh, Yes!](http://media.giphy.com/media/XuBJvrKHutnkQ/giphy.gif)	9
1	Babies do not belong in most work offices	9
1	It was both of ours first time. We both plan on trying again, but I was just wondering if there was anything I could do to make the next time successful. We both knew it was supposed to be slightly painful, but it seemed that this was far too painful for her to be practical.	9
1	Idk some of them are funny but the first one threw me off.   The queen fucking *loves* horses.	9
1	Honestly, I think that's better. Men need to learn that there are reasons other than "belonging to" another dude that we're not interested in them. I usually just say "no thanks." When pressed I say "I"m just here to hang with friends." When pressed further I say "I am not interested, please leave me alone." And finally comes the "dude, just FUCK OFF."	9
1	Guys, bisexual people don't exist.  Didn't you hear?	9
1	"I refuse to believe that one person can feel this way about somebody, without the other person having similar feelings" - what universe does this guy live in, lmao	9
1	Am a lady, had the same conversation with a dude friend. He said no but that he cared about me a ton as a friend and didn't wanna lose me. Magically, I did not decide to hate him, and we are still friends!!!	9
1	"He lets you go out by yourself?"	9
1	As Elizabeth Bennett brilliantly said "Pay me the compliment of believing what I say."	9
1	The fox and the grapes from Aesop's Fables.  An old story, but replace the fox with the guy and the grapes with the woman.    Sometimes I think guys like this grew up with fathers who believed way too much in the statement, "Don't take no for an answer".	9
1	Meh, probably in the minority here, but I feel like this is what people view feminism as, whereas it shouldn't be about any sex group being beneath another (unless we're talking *beneath*). Just switching the genders makes me feel like something TRP would post.	9
1	Ooh, been there. First, start with lots of lube, going super slow, and letting her relax as you start going inside of her - I'm talking go in an inch, stop, let her breathe and relax and let her body adjust. Let her take control. This should help BUT if the pain persists, I would highly recommend she have a chat with her OB/GYN, see if that level of discomfort is normal, and ask about a pelvic physical therapist. (Seeing a pelvic PT was hands down the best thing I've done for my sex life, and to empower myself.) Best of luck to you both!	9
1	Love me some Jeremy Renner, but almost every other Avenger is tied for second.	9
1	Do you need to be explicitly taught that? I feel like life should teach you that. (The accepting 'no' part. Dancing is a whole other story)	9
1	I like to write helpful guides.	9
1	sure, but when I was a really sad insecure person I didn't blame other people for it.	9
1	Is this from the ~~Wonderful~~ Amazing World of Gumball? I love that show..	9
1	Did you know that the female rapper in that song is actually Positive K with a higher voice? I was kind of impressed when I found that out.	9
1	It's funny because as a perpetually single girl I feel like there are tons of "my bf/fionce/husband did ____ ILOVEHIMSOMUCHGUYZ" posts that I can't relate to at all haha	9
1	I'm sure he'll be thinking about Black Widow and I'm okay with that.	9
1	Except I think it sounds so cool! I totally aspire to be a Social Justice Warrior. I want a cape!!	9
1	I don't see why people don't do that more often. Racists deserve more shame.	9
1	I forgot to mention that this friend I asked out is still one of my best friends and in fact I think we're closer than before as I'm not constantly wondering if she's into me anymore!  In hindsight anyway it's kinda clear that we'd not be right for each other, her boyfriend is a much better fit for her. And I've found someone who suits me too!	9
1	This gif is hilariously adorable. And it just keeps going! I'm dying over here. Your prom will be awesome, go get 'em tiger. :D	9
1	Wait... so the whole song is Positive K sexually harassing himself? That's... well, yeah, impressive.	9
1	Porque no los dos?	9
1	Gelato, but with chocolate mousse!	9
1	Virgins are no longer a common god currency. They mostly trade in bitcoin now.	9
1	Not going to lie; I just laughed so hard I'm getting my inhaler out.	9
1	I just watched it yesterday too! IN 3D. I was so overwhelmed in the best way.	9
1	It is interesting to talk to other grown men and see which ones get all flighty and nervous talking about "female products".	9
1	Strut your stuff, peahen! (Yes, that is the feminine of peacock.)	9
1	Yeah, unfortunately a lot of guys have learned that persistence pays off.   "I didn't mention it because it's really none of your business. All you need to know is that I don't like you."	9
1	What is that thing? I want one!	9
1	Why? She has already said she's not into it, he demeaned her and her choices. Fuck that guy, why sugarcoat the truth?	9
1	Walking the Dinosaur is clearly the most important part of this entire equation.	9
1	Came here to say this.  I need to step up my game.  Guess I should practice!	9
1	It's my pussy, I can do what I want.  I'm a big girl now.	9
1	I dealt with someone like this in high school and frankly it was a little terrifying. Didn't help that all my friends had to say about it was "Isn't that so cute? Isn't he sweet?"  and I was thinking "No, I've told him I'm not interested five thousand times and I'm starting to worry that he might murder me."	9
1	I once had a co-worker say to me "Just because there's a goalie doesn't mean you can't score" and winked at me when I told him I was *married* and held up my ring finger. This happened when I gave him a lighter during a smoke break. Some guys just don't care at all, no matter your relationship status.  Also reminds me of the time getting my ass grabbed at a concert when I was holding my (then) husband's hand. Ugh.	9
1	While I sympathize with this point of view very much, I hope it doesn't stop any of us from going out there in full voice just like "they" do.  It's a good thing to have some hard bark on you.	9
1	&gt; i should stop typing now.  Heheh...that moment when the frontal lobes kick in.	9
1	I wonder if he had someone for that part but she got sick of him. That song gets in my head and I get so annoyed at the guys part.	9
1	It's impossible to love someone you can't walk the dinosaur with.	9
1	A black kid cut my brother off once when we were on our way home from lunch and my brother called him a "Dumb n*".  I couldn't believe it (we're both white, btw).  I said "WTF? Not cool!" and he gave me some bullshit about how the n-word just the black version of "white trash" and assured him it was not.  It's disappointing finding out out someone you love is racist.	9
1	I too am a boy that has grown bored with trolly's unspectacular content.	9
1	&gt; Share interests with said guy. Cultivate a positive friendship.  I'm told it doesn't progress beyond this point for the majority of redditors.	9
1	I always get a montage going in my head at that question.   The montage is of me trying to hold a baby and somehow dropping it because I fail at hand eye coordination.   Then it cuts to a scene where I have to get pregnant and give birth just so I can replace the baby I dropped.	9
1	me too. :(	9
1	[NO CAPES!](http://imgur.com/gallery/9Ybgz)  Jk, you can have a cape if you want to.	9
1	mmm yup those are words.	9
1	I can still appreciate a funny or excited post even if I can't relate. Usually the ones I can relate to I find funnier, though.   Idk, if everyone could relate to everyone else about everything, it'd be really boring. I'm glad I can't relate to everything. I get introduced to new things and get to see things from others' perspectives.   We're all humans. At least we can always relate on that note.	9
1	Questions I'm tired of hearing from family members:   1: Any luck finding a job?  2: When are you going to get married?  and usually in that order	9
1	To be fair, not wanting to date someone because you are not sexually attracted to them is not unfair. You can't just date someone out of pity. However, one shouldn't be mean about it, right? But in this case, the guy is being rude and thinks he has the right to decide for her who she is or isn't going to date. The guy deserved it for undermining her.	9
1	And generally one has more friends than significant others. The statistics *do* rather check out, don't they?	9
1	Aaaaaaaaaand racist. Can't say I didn't see that coming.	9
1	I have started using "I'm not interested, but thank you" and I can't believe how many guys start countering with their positive attributes. "What? I'm a nice guy, I have a good job and a car, I like traveling and cooking, and I would always treat you right," etc, etc. No means no, not "change my mind", dude.	9
1	&gt; This isn't a negotiation. This is a no.  Brilliant!  I'm going to steal this, if you don't mind.	9
1	Well I love cheeseburgers... does that mean they love me too?	9
1	I thought it was going to have a cooler name, but it's just called a gym wheel.  For wheel gymnastics. Seriously.	9
1	Do you have any links? Not that I'm doubting you, she could be a product of her era afterall. But I haven't read anything that would suggest that. Although I am British and the Queen is very rarely criticised in even the most republican circles. [Plus there was that time she showed the Saudi King what's what.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/23/queen-elizabeth-king-abdullah-driving-story_n_6533236.html)	9
1	What the fuck is this article?	9
1	But how is that her responsibility?	9
1	Why are people so eager to have their baby held by others? What's the point, really? Can't I admire it from a distance without risk of harm to it or myself?	9
1	&gt; I thought girls were supposed to be nice.  That WAS nice.  You don't know what I wanted to say.	9
1	I posted a photo of myself when I was my daughter's current age, and had so many comments about how we are twins... Here comes my crazy MIL, who literally commented that she "refuses to see the comparison". I shut that shit down, deleted the comments, and pretended she never saw the picture.	9
1	This is the worst. I was on a spring break weekend last year without my SO and a few guys wanting to hit on me said things like "he doesn't know, right?" WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?	9
1	&gt;&gt;South Africa, where many adult men need penis transplants   Wait, what? Why?!	9
1	This image is getting circulated through reddit hard... and for good reason. This dude is such a creep.	9
1	Anyone else worried that she'd slip up and get her fingers caught under it?	9
1	[You sound like my kind of people.](http://img0.joyreactor.com/pics/post/accordingtodevin-comics-marathon-girls-947798.jpeg)	9
1	"I'm not interested" once wasn't enough.  "I'm not interested" twice wasn't enough.  "Okay you've annoyed me to such a degree with your delusion that you force me to be honest. I'm not attracted to you" (I find your body type disgusting)  You push and push and push someone, and they'll snap back. Come on now.	9
1	it's elevated to the level where so much as speaking about race or gender or anything not white male related can earn you "SJW" and your legitimacy/relevance is thrown out the window.	9
1	I'm a woman and I visit every day- I love that sub!	9
1	YOUR PATRIARCHY IS NOT RECOGNIZED IN FORT TAMPAX.	9
1	It's a no win situation. If you're straightforward with them, they say you're being a bitch. If you try to let them down gently or indirectly, they accuse you of leading them on.  I don't care if someone thinks I'm a bitch, so I prefer the straightforward method.	9
1	While going through grad school some family kept asking me why I needed another degree when I already had one.  Then they would ask why I needed another one when I had two.  When my younger sister got married one asked me when I was going to become a Mrs.  I said never, I'm going to be Dr. Damsell.	9
1	Saturday night, there is this huge dance party going on in my city. My plans: rent Legally Blonde on amazon, order in or make Annie's mac, and drink a very moderate amount of wine with my friend so I can wake up early to study in the am. I am SO PUMPED.	9
1	I saw it in IMAX. Definitely worth it.	9
1	When we were first dating, my fiance hugged me really hard while I was on my period. I innocently said, "Oh, that squeezed some blood out of me.... I'm like a ketchup bottle". The look of utter horror and revulsion on his face is still crystal clear on my mind. That was when I realized just how much guys are disgusted by the idea of menstruation. It still mystifies me though, because to me, it's just a bodily function. Like hey, I breathe, and also once a month blood comes out of my vagina XD.	9
1	[We're so cool.](http://www.yourwildworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Im-Cool-gif.gif)	9
1	Damn your managers were disgraceful. I have a biracial son but I live in NY. The worst thing I've gotten asked was if he is my "real" son and sometimes children will ask why my baby is black. also the death stares from old white people. Hahah. Hope there never comes a day when a racial slur is directed at me...	9
1	If you have Netflix, [Legally Blonde has been added as of today!](http://www.hypable.com/new-on-netflix-movies-tv-may-2015/#22)	9
1	Perfect response. I will use this in case anybody says this to me in response to my mixed race son.	9
1	So if I have little boobs, will I be like a T-rex?	9
1	The bars between the rings have finger clearance, I think.	9
1	Vascetomies are awesome. Whenever my friends ask me about mine and how bad it was I tell them; if I could, I'd do it again.	9
1	Not at all is she strongly anti-feminist.   Of course she's for traditional values, she has to be as the head of the Church of England, however she's the most forward thinking and modern Monarch we've ever had.   She's served in the army during the Second World War when many people thought women had no place getting involved and constantly shows the powerful men who surround her that she won't be pushed about, despite her age and her gender.	9
1	Quick question. Is finishing with racial slur a must or is it just optional?  Edit: I misread the title as "How to confess your love to a woman".	9
1	Nice! Any recommendations for what I can do to keep him comfortable while he heals?	9
1	I concur.   A++ Would allow man with knife near junk again.	9
1	You have just convinced me that I need to date a girl with a super fucked up back.	9
1	yass, I watch it because I like know what it would be like to be rich :'( like "Oh my SO made me upset, Im going to go fly to some fucking tropical paradise spur of the moment to get over it because I can do those things" Man, I wish i wasn't broke.	9
1	Preferring thigh gaps and skinny chicks is just that, a personal preference.  Because some guys like "thick" chicks doesn't mean I'm going to run out and try to gain weight.   However, the whale comment was completely unnecessary.	9
1	[Here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJg0BowmKz0)	9
1	Read some of the other comments, it's not a serious article. More of a comedic string of out of context facts	9
1	My family pressured me into holding my baby cousin and she started spazzing out and straightening her body. It reminded me of picking up a cat and then having it frantically try to escape.	9
1	I had a thanks Obama! moment this morning when I called my insurance company to find out what my maternity benefits cover.   Seriously, Mr. President Man, thanks.	9
1	Yeah, that was beautifully worded.	9
1	does it sound sexist when it's "pussy is abundant and low value"?	9
1	Really depends on the kind of anime you watch. It's like saying: books don't know how to tell proper love stories because twilight doesn't tell a good love story.	9
1	There is a GREAT [article about Tinder] (https://medium.com/matter/the-dickonomics-of-tinder-b14956c0c2c7) that references this woman's tweets.   It is wonderful.	9
1	I don't understand why you would date him instead of your BF, he seems like such a nice guy, I mean he poured his heart out to you! /s	9
1	I'm a several generation Georgian and I've never heard it before, either.  He went deep into the hate archives for that.	9
1	Whenever someone pegs me as an SJW I wear it proudly.  I feel it describes me very well.  I care for social equality and will fight for it wherever I can.  I **am** a Social Justice Warrior.	9
1	I'm thinking about going pixie next, and I need honest opinions. What do you girls think?	9
1	THIS IS THE BEST NEWS EVER!!!!!!!	9
1	Looks great! I think a pixie would look great on you.	9
1	You look so cute!! The shorter hair just looks fantastic and I can totally picture you with a pixie cut! You are so owning that look!	9
1	ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL	9

1	People talk about "resting bitch face" but you can *not* underestimate "super serious concentration browsing face"! Makes you look productive *and* it can scare off bothersome co-workers!	9
1	I sure hope you aren't in the minority! This is stupid, I was disappointed to see it in this sub.	9
1	I actually exclaimed "Thanks, Obama!" out loud the first time the pharmacist gave me my birth control with no co-pay (I had forgotten when it was going into effect).  The pharmacist looked at my like I was a crazy person, haha.	9
1	That's cute! I wish that would be our world as well.   On a similar note last week I was sitting on the toilet and saw that I had gotten my period, but had no pads or tampons near. So I called for my bf to bring me a small pad and he came to the toilet with EVERY pack of pads and tampons (arms full) I had in my drawer and said "I didn't know which you wanted so I just brought everything". So sweet.	9
1	What's taboo for guys is to be emotionally open and supportive, so that's what there is a lot of in TrollY.  When it's looking for sympathy when something bad happens people call it a pity party.  When it's looking for a high five when something good happens, people come in and accuse it of being a bragging sub.	9
1	That is amazing! It's everything I never knew I wanted in a bra.	9
1	Its not just anime. [Comics](http://i.imgur.com/QavuKw1.jpg) also help women know what sort of delicious sugar cured figure they should be aiming for.	9
1	If they touch a tampon they'll grow boobs and start menstruating out there urethras. Obviously.	9
1	But how would you give them a proper back massage if their boobs are too big to lie flat on their stomach?	9
1	I'm not sure if this place is full of empathy, at all times. It's a pretty cozy subreddit, but it's very quick to anger and hate, I feel.   Edit: It's only full of empathy if you agree with it. If your opinion or thought is different, it gets hated on quite hard!	9
1	Assholes. Didn't even see who it was as he slipped into the crowd. I first thought it was my husband and when I said like "hey, come on we're in public" and he didn't know what I was talking about. Then I'd realized what happened and felt embarrassed and angry, and people around us must've seen it. It wasn't really super crowded. Still makes me kinda feel gross all over all these years later.	9

1	I think trolly's all right, but what makes tx special is that it's a place for women to make all the dirty jokes they want.   Making dirty jokes is pretty much the entire of the rest of reddit, except it's all for men, so trolly isn't really all that special.   I still prefer ty to the rest of reddit though, due to the general respectfulness and feministy-slant.	9
1	You look super adorable! And a pixie (maybe ad some fun colours into the bangs?) would be just as awesome.	9
1	He's probably cheating on her. I mean, he's had relationships before, so obviously he'll continue to have relationships concurrently.	9

1	&gt; As someone who hates confrontation and 'being mean' it's really hard!  I know how you feel. I never did get used to saying "no" in a serious manner, so I just say incredibly nasty insults with the biggest smile and cheeriest voice. It works 100% of the time. I don't know why.	9
1	Yeah, seriously! Don't you know that he used to fuck Allie before OP worked there? He must still be cheating, because we know that if a man has sex with a woman once, he's always still having sex with her even after he starts dating another woman!	9

Like  http://www.short-hair-style.com/image-files/short_bob_blunt_bangs.jpg  or  http://newhaircutsforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/very-short-bob-hairstyles-very-short-bob-with-points-that-curl-in-from-the-side.jpg	9
1	There is a picture of me holding my niece when she was a month old, I look more awkward then her.	9
1	Feels. I'm full of parental issues in general - I still don't know how i feel about my dad dying either. He wasn't the best parent but he did try to be better for my younger brothers, and we weren't in contact when he died for various reasons.	9
1	Ugh, the fact that it's become a derogatory term is what pisses me off the most.  SOCIAL JUSTICE IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF SOCIETY  **IN WHAT FUCKED UP UNIVERSE IS FIGHTING FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE A BAD THING?! WHY IS THIS OPPOSITE WORLD?!?!?!!**	9
1	[You mean you'll go drinking with me?!](http://vinepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/mindy-kaling.gif) &lt;3	9
1	I mean, maybe the shoe should just be off of the first foot?	9
1	It's not really our place to judge what other people think romantically about obese people. Her saying he was disgusting didn't come out of thin air. This was clearly about romantic boundaries, and someone can certainly find another person disgusting because of their appearance.	9
1	Yep, just sounds like flipped over PUA bullshit to me.	9
1	I'm gonna fuck that robot.	9
1	Oooh, first time you'll both be so nervous. Her muscles down there might have tensed up and that can make it very painful. Lube, patience and going slow helps.	9
1	Yeah... I'm not looking forward to when I finally give in an dig into some therapy.	9
1	All I could think about whilst watching this was how many times/ways I could hurt myself. It's beautiful!  Also, I went off BC before the whole "free" thing took effect, but I can imagine how excited I would have been! I might start taking it again, JUST because it's free. It's like Costco samples - do I *need* them? No. But they're free...	9
1	Or you could find someone who otherwise couldn't go and give the tickets to them.	9
1	[So moist](http://www.ruralramblings.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/02-08-10_llama-face_8175.jpg)	9
1	One day I will write a book titled "why I hate my dad". The cover will be a blurry photo of me on a one night stand with two guys, with the subtitle "cuz he done fucked me up."	9
1	And in my darkplace, bind them.	9
1	I'll argue with people or make my statement if the thread isn't FULL of people I'd have to be arguing with because I don't want to get ganged up on.   But, yeah, I think it's good to get our voices out there just so people know that reddit isn't just an echo chamber. (You can always disable inbox replies as soon as you post it, too.)	9
1	/r/askmen is a pile of crap, it's very much /r/askmensrightsactivists much of the time. If those guys like being catcalled, they can all gather in one special catcall city and holler at each other. But the rest of us shouldn't have to suffer, women or men	9
1	Butt tones and boxer-briefs should be a song. A sexy song that encourages butt stuff.	9
1	as a guy, that shit just makes me go "seriously, dude?"	9
1	No. It's just something I've come to realize. Honestly he's an amazing boyfriend, but I've gained 50 lbs over our 7 year relationship. We've just become less physically intimate.   He's in no way rude about it or anything, and often encourages me to eat healthy and work out with him. It's just really eye-opening to realize how long it has been since we've had sex, and it's something that I can easily fix about myself.	9
1	Just wanna say I love your flair. Kitty is amazing.	9
1	Like Dr. Princess where it's just her last name and not a title or anything.	9
1	Dear god, Chris Evans in that blue underarmour shirt.	9
1	My grandmother always said that as well, and her best friend/next door neighbor of 40+ years was black (both now gone).  My granny actually said it to me in front of her once, and the look on my face prompted her friend to chuckle and say to me, "Honey, nigger don't mean black, it means slave."	9
1	I watched the first one last night. Mark Ruffalo. Oh god, Mark Ruffalo.	9
1	I don't think I've seen any moderation! I was referring more to the userbase than the mods, though.	9
1	Can we have a moment of appreciation for Thor and Tony arguing over who had the best girlfriend based on their accomplishments? Because I don't think I've seen that in a movie, *ever*.	9
1	That line always pisses me the hell off. We're a team. We're both the damn goalie. And that's exactly what it means.	9
1	Is that not, by definition just as unequal as before?	9
1	[Yup!](http://imgur.com/a/dzTkQ?gallery)	9
1	Most versatile metal in the world ;)	9
1	I am sexually active but alcoholically inactive. The wierd part for me is that because I don't shave my legs or wear make up I find a lot of it hard to relate to, still fun though! I enjoy hearing jokes about fairly 'girly' things without a fuck-tonne of sexism attached. It's super refreshing and it's a good influence on me, maybe.	9
1	Now see, I think it's okay to confess your feelings for someone who is in a relationship. Love isn't first come first served, and sometimes there is someone better out there.  However, the *only* response to "I don't feel the same way" is some version of "That sucks, but thank you for your honesty." Fighting it just makes you look like an asshole.	9
1	This is true. [Queenie watching her horse](http://i.imgur.com/pdbtzpn.jpg) vs. [Queenie watching the London Olympics.](http://i.imgur.com/cOQ4VZI.jpg)	9
1	Some say he's still fucking Allie to this day!	9
1	Sure, but that belies the point: "having enough women" shouldn't be a thing that matters to the point where the only reason enough is reached is when legally there can be no more.   Praise be to RBG, may she live forever.	9
1	I havent been this jealous of someone's ringtone since . . . Freshman year high school?	9
1	Girl, I don't drink either; I'm here for the period posts. And anything with Tina from Bob's Burgers.	9
1	Perfect. Couldn't have explained it better myself. Thank you.	9
1	Since Allie's such an obvious whore, maybe Mr. Neckbeard would have a better chance with her.	9
1	Meanwhile in Ignoranceville, FL, my boss was whining about her premiums going up and blaming it on Obamacare.  Ugh!!  Did people's memory get erased from before 2008? How have people not known that the cost of healthcare has been astronomically increasing since the late 90s??  That shit has nothing to do with Barrack!	9
1	Eh family... Reminds of one of my friend's grandmother who literally keeps a list of everyone that contacts her and those that don't to keep her will updated...  Regardless, CONGRATULATIONS!!! What did you get your degree in?	9
1	Were they using the "men drink this/women drink this" shit? To me that's a mark of failure; if you have to lean on gender stereotypes to sell your stuff, then you clearly have nothing actually good to say about it and zero confidence in your product (or you're just an unimaginative shithead) so I'm not going to pick it up. Don't care if it's the best brew in the world, I can handle second best without the baggage.	9
1	Beer nerds love to deny the fact that sexism is prevalent in beer culture. Like, no, that shit is everywhere. It doesn't have to be a naked woman on a bottle of beer to be sexist, but that happens as well.	9
1	Omfg, this has to be one of the worst things I have ever seen.	9
1	[YAY](http://imgur.com/HTKNaWk)	9
1	Why is this kid so coordinated?? I thought they were supposed to barely be walking at that size. It's kind of freaking me out.	9
1	I guess on the upside if you have a bit of an accident no one will notice?	9
1	Yeah, don't you know that she used to fuck OP's boyfriend? That means that they're still having sex, so he should date Allie instead!	9
1	Khloe is funny as shit!  She knows she's balls ass rich and doesn't pretend she's not, but she also doesn't flaunt it over people as much as Kim does.	9
1	PM me, girl... I've got the goods and will give them to anyone who asks! :)	9
1	One time I was filing my nails and apparently had my super focused face on because as he was walking up my boss said, "you work too hard" and then approached close enough he could see over my desk and added "on your nails."  Then we just laughed because I have a great boss/job.	9
1	I legit thought that was a Halloween/prop costume from the thumbnail. That's a fashion trend that won't happen even in "ironic" circles of Portland/Austin/Nashville/etc. Like, if I wore that people might not notice period stains, they'll just think I slaughtered someone and waltzed through their remains. I'd rather just be the natural bleeding woman.	9
1	That MRS degree. Not the highest paying field out there, and advancement is sketchy at best.	9
1	Oddly enough, drilling into the actual product page reveals that apparently everyone except for people who wear size M have bought it. Although maybe they only made like one of each size.  [Here's](http://www.ae.com/aerie/browse/product.jsp?productId=7495_9096_178&amp;catId=cat5020120) the unfortunate thing.  Also, a mini PSA that the 7 panties for $27 is a thing right now.	9
1	Would likely make great pjs/house dress for shark week though!	9
1	I feel like maybe if they were objectified for different things they would realize how it's unwanted. Like "HEY BABY HOW MUCH MONEY YOU GOT IN YOUR WALLET?? LET ME SEE LET ME SEE OH YEAH". I am sure they wouldn't appreciate that.	9
1	And in sizes beyond the 34A - 38DD... With proper fitters!	9
1	PiiiiiiNOOOOOOO NOOOOIR.   I just watched this episode again and I want Titus to be my roommate. I am willing to be locked in a bomb shelter for a while, if that's what it takes.	9
1	I don't even have a period anymore because my contraceptive implant. All these funny period posts makes me feel me I'm missing out!	9
1	No. Dear god never again!   Sorry some awful flashbacks of being woken up at dawn to that exact question. I will never be the same.	9
1	I don't know what it is but I kind of like it like that in some ways; when his face is at your boobs while you're doing PIV, you get epic tit action without much scrunch. Maybe it's because I've also hooked up with girls who tend to be my height or below so I'm just like used to it.	9
1	Wow, even dumber than I thought. And pulling the "we have a woman who affirmed us it was totes cool" just seals it. Fuck 'em; you can get good craft brews that come without the chauvinism.	9
1	The end of your tongue?	9
1	Is he being shallow? I mean, of course he doesn't have to be physically attracted to you if you've gained 50 pounds over seven years, but I hope he's not cruel about it.	9
1	Holy shit yes. I have bigger thighs but a smaller waist, so I typically have to get a bigger size, for my legs. So then I need a belt.   If it's too tight, I get a muffin top, too loose and I get this popping sound when I walk, where the material rubs together on my legs and it kinda sounds like weird little farts. I can never get a belt that's just right.  I feel like goldilocks, but I can't find baby bear's stuff.	9
1	i just feel people would be up in arms about a guy saying that	9
1	Here's the trouble: does anyone know of the British Chris Evans?? It's not that great a mental image...	9
1	10/10 would break all my fingers rolling over them.	9
1	&gt; You can always disable inbox replies as soon as you post it, too.  I love this feature. I say my piece, and then I peace out.	9
1	The best moderation is unseen. Like the fist of God, it must be swift, unrelenting, and invisible.    And keeping us off of r/all is helpful as fuck.	9
1	Eurgh, you're right!  With all the Age of Ultron talk these days, I'd forgotten that there was a Chris Evans other than Cap.	9
1	This is both adorable and heartbreaking.	9
1	Some bras *do* come with pockets! Them ones with the optional padding. Discard padding. Now you have two pockets.	9
1	I'm suddenly imagining shitty pickup artists wearing this as a ridiculous way to try to sleep with women.  "I'm already dressed like something you put in your vag, why not let me just slip on in? ;)"  barf	9
1	I read this in the power thirst commercial voice.	9
1	no no semen--&gt; vagina, not urethra. you cannot PEE OUT semen!	9
1	I'm sorry, what? I mean there's the odd joke about eating cold pizza for breakfast but that definitely doesn't mean someone is overweight...	9
1	She's on a wooden gym floor, not a spring floor that gymnasts typically work on. It's nearly impossible to stick a landing if you don't have something to help absorb the shock.	9
1	"Jenkins, you've angered her tits, step back slowly before they strike and inject you with venom."  If women had a secret venomous attack vector, history would have been so much better.	9
1	I'd be happy with "This bra is available in a wide range of sizes (none of this stopping at, or before, DD nonsense) and you can actually go to a store in your country and try it on instead of having to take your chances buying online".  Since, well, that's what I currently have to do.	9
1	Yeah, but then you translate it back to English and it's something like "extra lame wheel of mediocrity"	9
1	Seriously. I wear a 38G (UK sizes, I'd be an I in US sizes) and I have to buy all my fricken bras online and ship them back if they don't fit.	9
1	[That's beyond our borders.](http://i.imgur.com/DiThvgh.png)	9
1	As a guy there are many reasons the wife and I might have a dry spell. Maybe he knows your unhappy with your body image. Maybe he's stressed out. Just talk it out and see what's up. No sense in getting worried yet. GL	9
1	Smaller....more dexterity.   Dr. Tits: Brain Surgeon	9
1	Do you have a different Victoria's Secret than the rest of us? Not only is all their advertising geared towards men, but their bras are also built for aesthetics rather than comfort or practicality, their employees are not trained in how to properly fit bras, and every one I've ever met has been extremely rude.  Oh, there's also the fact that VS was actually created with men in mind in the first place. The whole point was to make a lingerie store where men wouldn't feel awkward shopping.	9
1	Why would somebody say this to a random person on the street?  It's not even flirtatious.  It's just condescending and presumptuous.	9
1	&gt;"Most of the negative comments (about the event) are about the degrading and objectification of the females, but there’s not a lot of that in the reality of the Silk Exotic," Porter said.   YOU HAVE GOT TO BE SHITTING ME.	9
1	Sorry! I burst'd your bubble!  Here, take this [Chris Evans o-face gif](http://i.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/chris-evans-o-face.gif)...	9
1	... an ode to black penis	9
1	BROCKETS?!  wasn't there an amazing thing that went around a while back where you could slip a cup-shaped wallet into your bra?? Whatever became of that??	9
1	Those spaghetti holder need to be colored in blue. That would be amazing.	9
1	It wasn't on the street - it was a message on an online dating site. It said:  "You are a truly beautiful girl! Haha but you should become a redhead, cause I think redheads are way hotter ;D"  Had it been in person I would have read that motherfucker	9
1	Apology very much accepted.  ^^^God, ^^^he's ^^^so ^^^pretty!	9
1	I was more worried that she'd pinch her butt cheeks when she sat on the rung &amp; let it carry her through the bottom of the ring.	9
1	I didn't want it until you mentioned it looked like a tampon.  Now I want it.	9
1	Oh, I gotcha.  Actually, it being online doesn't make it seem any more reasonable.  I just don't get some people.  "Hey, you and I have never talked before, but I'd like to say, first and foremost, that I think you should change for me in some arbitrary way for no real reason.  It's ok because I'm being adorable what with my laughing and smileys and such.  This has never worked and I have no reason to believe it will, but I'm going to do it anyway because I have no social awareness."	9
1	Oh my....IN THE BOUDOIR	9
1	Watch this while "ass and titties" is playing in the background. Do it.	9
1	My iud was covered 100% by my insurance. This should have come sooner. I only wish Obamas bigger health care laws had been passed.	9
1	If we search hard enough through reddit I bet we can find a post from him complaining about it	9
1	How did I not know I could do this? Though I'd still be tempted to go and look anyway. It's like a train wreck.	9
1	It's on sale! $20 if you're a M.	9
1	I'm usually around 30F (US), if I manage to find them online, they're close to $100 each with shipping	9
1	I don't know why you're getting downvoted, people are allowed to be (or not be) attracted to different body shapes.  50 pounds is quite a bit of weight to gain.  A physical attraction can be independent of emotional attachment.	9
1	I just got on the pop pill after years of using condoms with hubby (couldn't afford an iud and didn't know about other pill options) and hubster was shocked that it was free. I totally did the fist pump and said "thanks Obama!"  Much wow. Such awesome.	9
1	My lovely trolls, if you would like this ringtone - PM me with your emails and I will send it to you as soon as I can. I have a show tonight, so I won't be able to send the ringtone until tomorrow when I'm back at my computer. I will send it I promise!  The ringtone is 30 seconds long, and starts where he sings "Peeeeenoooo noir, in the boudoir, etc."  The beginning of the song didn't have a good cut off point.	9
1	I don't actually think it's that awful. It may have been a poor color choice, and it definitely resembles a used tampon in the image, but I bet it looks a lot better on  a person.   I'm also thinking that if you add some light blue dye into the picture, you'd have a great blue to purple gradient dress that would also be unique for $20. If I wasn't so short and a fan of pants, I'd definitely consider buying it.	9
1	I feel like it's pretty balanced out. Like I've said some stuff here that have pissed some ladies off, I have yet to feel like they were flat out disrespectful though, but it always seems like for every troll who disagrees with me, there's a troll who is shoveling up what I'm shittin out.	9
1	Eh... It's quick to hate about hateful things. Like, hate on people for their lack of empathy. The only example I can think of is the comment thread in [I don't judge your sexual choices, but seriously why are you grinding on a pole. This is a dive bar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrollXChromosomes/comments/2h4w4i/i_dont_judge_your_sexual_choices_but_seriously/) But that seemed like it was based on a legitimate difference of opinion. What did you have in mind?	9
1	Imagine the synchronized version of it. Rolly madness.	9
1	Yea I'm not too thrilled about that last bit either.	9
1	[OhSweetJeebus.](http://img.pandawhale.com/85218-sweet-Jesus-gif-n1pT.jpeg)	9
1	note: he sent this picture to me today.	9
1	This is kind of genius - I don't know why I've never thought of that.	9
1	Yeah! Where do you learn that stuff I mean seriously? Did everyone get a manual and I missed that class?	9
1	YES! I had no idea this was a thing bc I had an IUD at the time. Then my friend told me BC was free now. [MRW](https://saynsumthn.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/pp-black-wioman-dances-free-bc-oct-2013.jpg)	9

1	people when the supreme court was all men: "oh there just aren't any qualified women. or they just don't *want* to be justices. no big deal!"   people when speaking of a hypothetical all-women supreme court: "omg that would be terrible matriarchy anarchy i would riot"	9
1	[Machine wash and pockets?!](http://imgur.com/KiXMqR1)	9
1	Ouch, yeah, they can be pretty pricey. I've found some good ones for cheap, but you have to really search.	9
1	I agree with you on all of this. I wish commercials detailed more about the importance of having a correct fit too... I wore a B cup for three years before getting measured properly and put into DD cups. I still blame my lack of nipple sensitivity on not knowing how to get measured.	9
1	Hugs. &lt;3	9
1	I'm not gonna lie, it's really, really hard. But it's worth it. I've only been going a few months and I always feel like I get the most out of the sessions that make me cry.	9
1	I'm not blaming you for it - these things happen to people, y'know?  If your relationship is still good, I'd still talk to him about that. Glad you are!	9
1	Quick! Make it happen! Let's kickstarter this shit!	9
1	While I want to stab a few people for those kinds of things, I don't wish it on others, including innocent men who can sometimes have enough troubles feeling valuable physically. "An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."	9
1	You know how to pick 'em, literally.	9
1	Unfortunately this depends on the policy you get through the marketplace and is not an Obamacare-wide thing.  Nuvaring is not covered on my marketplace plan :(  http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/08/22/342400717/insurers-refuse-to-cover-some-contraceptives-despite-health-law	9
1	I can't believe I was ever subscribed to that place. By the third confession bear saying that he hated black people getting over 1000 up votes I peaced out and haven't even let curiosity get the better off me since. That sub needs purging.	9
1	"Ah crap, rejection! Quick, must find a flaw to make myself feel better; fuck, nothing, nothing, shoes will do!"	9
1	I can't wait for vasalgel! No snip required and reversible. Now men can really start taking more responsibility for birth control.	9
1	I think my main gripe against VS is that everything is made by toddlers in Indonesia.  It's ethically wrong to shop there.	9
1	I just can imagine a commercial where there's a couple making out and the guy tries to take off the girl's bra and she's like "no, this is too fucking comfortable to be taken off"	9
1	I love the curvy ones. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3	9
1	There are so many stores that do this it is honestly difficult to find ones that don't. Heck even though American Apparel is made in the USA the owner is such a sleeze it's no better than Forever21.  I cannot think of one store or brand that is ethical and in my affordable price range.	9
1	&gt; confession bear saying that he hated black people   Hey hey hey, he doesn't hate black *people*, he just hates black *culture*.	9
1	[This site has many troll-worthy things.](http://www.lookhuman.com/design/48439-running-away-from-my-adult-responsibilities)	9
1	Ah the classic "I know with all my heart that I'm the better choice for you!   What you feel doesn't matter because I *know*" tactic.   How did this not make her swoon?!   I mean confessing feelings is fine, but not even established companies disparage the competition. What makes people think it will work with dating?   Edit: holy shit balls there's more than one image. Dafuq man?	9

1	Can I get the David Tennant version?	9
1	It's a shame women don't wear their wedding rings on their middle finger as it would allow for an extra message to be communicated when showing it to people giving unwanted attention.	9
1	JESUS CHRIST.  I feel like Chris Evans is everywhere right now and I'm SO OKAY WITH It BECAUSE GODDAMN.	9
1	Omg I love that.  "Sorry am I going to fast?"  "No I just never wanna take this bra off k?"	9
1	You sure have yourself a keeper. :)	9
1	I agree. I was wearing a 46DD and having an awful time until I found /r/abrathatfits and figured out that I should be wearing a 38G(UK sizes). Such a big difference!	9
1	Actually, it was his attempt at hitting on me, which continued throughout the night.	9
1	Are you sure that he isn't making lifting noises when he is sexing?	9
1	He just follows your exact orders, He's a keeper.	9
1	&gt;I was nice enough to be polite to him and say hi when we passed on the sidewalk. That means we're in love, right?   In India it kind of is. Eye contact is more than enough! Being outside without a male companion is an open invitation. India is cray.	9
1	It's like a reverse Beschdel test!	9
1	Before I saw Captain America, he was the only one I'd heard of. Until this comment, I'd forgotten he existed. Why would you do this? :'(	9
1	That looks like such an amazingly fun piece of equipment that I would probably only kill myself five or six times playing with it.	9
1	Incidentally, its also a great place to hide things (inside pad wrapping, tampon wrapping, tampon boxes). Works for guys and girls. It's where I kept all my favorite nintendo DS games and gel pens as a kid, and my sister never checked. It's embarrassing how you could almost use it as a safe.	9
1	I bought a bottle of wine because of that song!	9

1	All you would need is like a string headband. Perfect Halloween costume!	9
1	I agree!  One thing I've noticed in a lot of other subs is that some childfree women can be really mean towards mothers.  And, of course, in real life whether a woman has a kid or not she's doing it wrong.  But here, I feel like we do a really good job of supporting each other's choices, no matter what they may be.  I love that.	9
1	Am I the only one who thinks "when are you having kids?" is a super personal question? Like, damn homie take a step back away from my ovaries! Ugh. I hate it.	9
1	[You earned it.](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/wp-content/blogs.dir/470/files/2012/04/i-6e0bd417a147f69c60c1e0488411ee74-florida_squid.jpeg)	9

1	I'm not sure if this is allowed, but I use this: http://www.youtube-mp3.org/  to get music as I'm no good with technology. You find the video, paste the URL and convert edit:then click download.  Here's the pinot noir URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXqhgLjkcCU  Iphone lets you use music added to your phone as a ringtone ^^so ^^I ^^know ^^what ^^my ^^next ^^ringtone ^^is	9
1	I think if you wore the right colored shrug with it, it'd be okay.	9
1	Kim is a goddess. No shame.	9
1	You're still loads better than some of the fuckery that ends up on Cake Wrecks.	9
1	To her defense, pain is relative to everyone. I honestly didn't think it hurt, but I had already put in for a PTO day, so I said fuck it, and the dog and I went for a run and watched some Netflix. Everybody is different.	9
1	And don't forget, if you are interested and respond too eagerly, you're a whore!  Whatever the outcome, you're in the wrong and there's a shitty name for you.	9
1	Yea.. And people wonder why shorter guys get cynical.  I don't believe they have to physically mount you nor do I believe you'd experience any real sexual difficulties with a shorter dude.   I'm probably overreacting here but this is too negative and shaming for me.	9
1	Yeah my Paragard implant wasn't that painful but really uncomfortable; physiology is everything. But it can be so painful that women pass out; I've heard that more than a few times. So it's not something to take lightly at all.	9
1	Don't steal my dream, cake-troll!  Edit: Love the cake, btw :)	9
1	The so painful you pass out thing, is what happened to me 😫	9
1	Oooh that one's pretty!	9
1	But it doesn't look like my vision of a cat at all.	9
1	21...umm, no. Don't worry about them! I know hardly anyone my age 'starting' a family (mid 20's here).   You do you! :)	9
1	Even in healthy ways, your relationship with your father can affect your relationship with your partner. It's not uncommon to end up with a partner that has similarities to our dads because fathers are the first male figure you have to model your expectations from. Plus the cliche is that people with daddy issues self destruct, but the fact you're in therapy and have someone who wants to marry you already puts you leagues ahead &lt;3	9
1	Even sporadic contact is harassment; if he contacted you recently I do reccomend you file a report, so at least there's documentation that establishes a precedent. So if he ever does it again, you have prior standing. He may not, I hope not, but if he does it's easier to shut him down. And you did a really great thing calling him out, regardless of what he says otherwise. It is rape by every concept of the law and your own; that's all that matters.   I hope the therapist helps you and you find your footing again; you seem really awesome and I just wish you the best.	9
1	Those children weren't birthed, they just salsa'ed out of their mothers' vaginas. How is that even real?	9
1	Time to move overseas!	9
1	Nope I've had it for a year and a half now. The first 6 months were really bad but it got significantly better after that. Was worth it. I have the paragaurd :)	9
1	LOVE the title.  My SO is a public defender, and loves RBG.  For her first birthday I printed out a few of her quotes and framed them individually to hang in her office.   And a few Christmases ago I had [this](http://i.imgur.com/9I16A.jpg) made.   I made sure RBG was represented in the background.	9
1	It's on the table lol	9
1	I'd make it about a quarter rotation before ending up under the twisted wreckage. Authorities would be baffled because the wheel contained no flammable material.	9

1	Myanmar. You're a star!	9
1	Also, I have A LOT of tattoos, and had my fair share of piercings, which is why I posted this :p those did not compare.	9
1	I thought about an all female supreme court and said "wow that would be so strange". then I realized how long we've had an all male court...	9
1	Long as you have his name and/or contact information, it's worthwhile. A report is a report; it doesn't mean much just filed by itself, but it's very useful for getting the cops involved if he bothers you again and allows for you to establish a restraining order against him if he still persists.  But yeah, hopefully that's the last of that shitheel.	9
1	To counter, inequality is that there have been *and* could be 9 male justices again, **so why not 9 women**?  edit also a persons gender shouldnt really matter is more the main point  edit 2: yes Im gonna compare people to pets but it would be like "okay you can have 4 dogs and the 2 you have are already black. How many more black dogs are enough?" rgb: why *not* all black dogs?	9
1	We can open a bakery together! It will be called Cakesperts (cake experts)	9
1	Now that you've brought to mind waltzing through bloody remains, I kind of need it.	9
1	So there are no real problems, but there is a real stigma?  That makes the joke not funny to me.	9
1	I think Lena Dunham wore a really puffy dress that was shaded like that. Yep. Used tampon look...	9

1	You're some kind of genius, aren't you?	9
1	Well, they could, but then they'd actually put well-fitting bras on the models.	9
1	Will that ring tone make me pop-u-lar?	9
1	now that I've had a few hours to process maybe good. Hah. I've got 1 year old twins, so I'm completely not ready for another ride on this rollercoaster. Buuuuut, we did agree on having 3, and this means all our kids will be out of high school before I'm 45. So this will be okay.	9

1	I was worried her head would get caught and her neck would break and there would be blood everywhere	9
1	I asked my fiance for a banana last night. When I heard him come up to me I started reaching out for it and eventually looked and saw he had done exactly this.  I don't feel so alone now! :P	9
1	Mentally ill trolls unite :D!!!!	9
1	And suddenly a mic just drops out of nowhere. *Boom*	9
1	There's a post on the front page of trollx right NOW about a girl getting a short hair cut where a guy commented (I creeped his comment history, it's a guy) "in my opinion long hair is waaay better."	9
1	Oh so close and yet so far...	9
1	Sperm completely surplus to requirements. :)	9
1	Every time I see that banana i feel like its flapping its little peels!	9
1	It could be like both? I dunno, I heard actors have these issues where they think they fall in love but not really. Maybe you should back off hanging out your friend and see how you feel after that. Or if you want, just go along with it and see what happens.  Good luck, OP!  PS. Don't listen to me, I'm drunk.	9
1	oh holy shit, how are you even awake? I hope you feel better soon.	9
1	^I ^think ^it ^looks ^cute. Don't mind me...	9
1	I am the manager.    With most industries, I'd agree with you, but I work at an independent bookstore.  Even with both the owners working for free, we barely break even. Every time they scape together a bit of a raise, I'm thankful.  We're having an unexpectedly fabulous year, hence the 10%.    Edit for typo	9
1	I've had a pixie for almost six years now. I highly recommend it to everyone. Any decent hairdresser will be able to give you a cut that flatters you specifically.	9
1	Except that doesn't account for the fact that I LOVE MY JOB! and I have tried better paying positions only to go back to what I do now.   I'd rather live on on a budget than work at a job I don't like.  This 10% is pure gravy!	9
1	Somebody get this woman a kickstarter.	9
1	Ahh well then you are being compensated fairly.   Love is highly underrated.	9
1	This is so superficial and unrealistic.  The average man's banana is not nearly so perfectly yellow or gently curved.   \#Allbananadicksarebeautiful	9
1	Can I get a 34DDD in something cute and not disgusting full coverage hey cover your granny titties?!?!!!   I want to feel sexy with my big boobies!	9
1	"Please provide a list of what you find least attractive so I can do that to make sure you're never attracted to me at all."	9
1	Oh jeez.  She sounds like a peach! Thank you!  I got a degree in Psychology, with a double minor in Addiction Studies and Sociology.  I start an internship with the state in couple weeks!  I'm pretty pumped.	9
1	Yeah, I'm going away for the summer and then I'm going abroad for the fall semester, so I've decided I won't make any moves because there would be no point. Also, she has a boyfriend. But also I don't want to back off hanging out with her because she is the coolest and seeing her and talking to her makes me really happy and we held hands during the really intense parts of Age of Ultron as emotional support and it was really nice and comforting but also I'm still not sure about my sexuality and blaaaaaaaarg.  I'm too sleep deprived from finals to deal with this.	9
1	Thank you!  I'm sorry your family did this to you as well.  I'm probably just being overly sensitive about it, but it stings a little.  I'm the first person in my family to graduate college, so I thought they'd be excited/proud! Maybe not.  Oh well, I'll be excited and proud of me!	9
1	That's so awesome! Go you! You must be invaluable to them.	9
1	In Australia I got my Implanon for $6 with Medicare + health care card when the full price is $200. :)	9

1	Send an anonymous tip in that her RV is a mobile meth lab.	9
1	My sister posted this email that someone sent her. I think the dude is some sort of psychologist? That's what a Facebook comment said.   We had a good laugh about it, especially the college bit. I'm a lady engineering student and am so vastly outnumbered in my classes that I need sauerkraut at the end of the day to go with all that sausage.	9
1	Oh no baby girl, I will wear a fucking garbage bag if I want to.	9
1	Yes, that is great! When I was in high school, there was a boy who used to bother me, including touching my legs and arms. I was too polite to make a big fuss over it, but I still always told him I wasn't interested. So he kept saying he would do anything for me and give me anything I wanted. And I told him that I wanted him to stop touching me and to leave me alone. It turns out, he wasn't willing to give me whatever I wanted.	9
1	I choke-laughed loud and hard at this.   I don't know why.  I'm sorry. :(	9
1	&gt;I need sauerkraut at the end of the day to go with all that sausage.   Can you be my sister?	9
1	My narcissist father has casually mentioned that my boyfriend and I need a bigger house so he and my mom can eventually move in... NOPE. Tell your mom to please fuck off!	9
1	I'm not sure what US brand you wear, but 30F US for a lot of brands is equivalent to a 30E in UK sizing, which you can find for much less than that and with free shipping online! For example, [the black version of this bra](http://www.amazon.com/Cleo-Womens-Minnie-Balconnet-Orange/dp/B00JR9TY8E/ref=sr_1_41?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430533638&amp;sr=1-41&amp;keywords=30e+bra) is only $16 right now, with free shipping and returns (though Cleo bands run somewhat tight, especially compared to US bras, so you might want to try a 32DD as well).	9
1	Why can't we get modular bras?  You know, buy the band and the cups separate?	9
1	Is there a subreddit for male o faces?   I must know.     For science.	9
1	Sounds like you're "giving off a vibe" that you are going to have accomplishments greater than those of your parents. How dare you?	9
1	Not today, Satan. NOT TODAY.	9
1	I dyed my hair blue and purple and my whole family kept asking if my bf was okay with it and if he approved of my hair being that color and he straight up told them "it's not my hair and I love the way she chooses to express herself through color, if she likes it that's all that matters" I swooned HARD.	9
1	Sounds like Grandma needs to not ride the douchcanoe over the vag waste river and out to the septic sea. Sorry you got embarrassed like that *hugs*.	9
1	Once I reach a certain level of excite, the tip of my tongue disappears like a turtle head :o    :DDDD	9
1	[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr0fYUzvxP0) the rest of the video of this performer!  It's called German wheel/Rhönrad and it's awesome.  I'm totally with you on making it an Olympic sport.	9
1	It's like, girl. You go have fun with that. I'll just chill over here with my green hair and (tiny bit of) disposable income and watch the mess with my cat, sippin margaritas and not giving ONE FUCK.   I lost a childhood best friend of mine because her and one of her mommy friends shamed me for not having children yet. Apparently, not having children when you're young ruins your life when your older. Anyone not poppin' out babies in their 20's is an idiot. What? No. Sorry, girl. You ain't shaming me for that shit.	9
1	you've got plenty of time. Just had my little one at 29 and i'm happy i waited.	9
1	An apartment or somewhere with HOA that hates RV's would also be good.	9
1	Mine has one wide pocket that goes across the boob area. I put my phone in there when I go walking. Very convenient.	9
1	Thanks.  I'm a stay at home mom with 3 kids ages 4, 5 &amp; 6.  Got uppers for the day &amp; downers for at night.	9
1	Since the [AskReddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3249ff/women_of_reddit_when_did_you_first_notice_that/) thread is old, and reading those replies reminds me of when I first started transitioning. Within two years of presenting female, I had "rape" yelled at me from a car while bike riding, a stalker at work (retail job), and a peeping tom at my apartment. I never knew it was this bad, but UGH it sucks.	9
1	All I could think of http://persephonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Homage-to-a-menstrual-cycle.gif	9
1	&gt; One thing I've noticed in a lot of other subs is that some childfree women can be really mean towards mothers.   And vice versa. Unthinking assumptions can be pretty oppressive, just ask your nearest lesbian.	9
1	I despise Lena Dunham.	9
1	The legs are the best part. You truly have a gift.	9
1	I almost passed out. My heart rate dropped to about 25 beats/min. I also almost threw up. Was it worth it? Yeah.	9
1	Thank you for your comment, it made me laugh which I haven't done at all since shopping. I needed that. :)	9
1	I'm 31 (and kids'll happen down the line eventually) and everyone else around me is getting engaged/married and popping 'em out now... meanwhile my hardest life decision is whether to re-do my red dye this weekend or next, or if I wanna eat nachos or Chipotle for dinner. Meh, I say. Live your life the way that suits you best, and don't worry about anyone else. :)	9
1	&gt; I'm also thinking that if you add some light blue dye into the picture, you'd have a great blue to purple gradient dress  Just for the love of all that's good and kind in the world, don't post it to Facebook and ask what colour it is.	9
1	Yaaaaaasssss. Bianca is life.	9
1	It's different for everyone, though, honestly. You hear stories like OP's, where it was awful, but then I've had two (mirena) and it hurt less than when I got my ears pierced.    Actually, the 2nd one should've hurt the worst (Because she had to remove the old one), but it was easier, because I had a different doctor and she was extra gentle and gave me a topical anesthetic.  If you're still in the market for a BC method, you might just talk to your gyno and see what they say? Can't hurt to investigate.	9
1	That's when you just hang up and block. Because nobody has time to deal with that bullshittery.	9
1	No worries, I did too when I saw the emails.  My oma even included a picture.  She then sent an "UPDATE!!" email today, and a bunch of family replied to that as well.  I can't decide if I should laugh or cry.  I pretty much make the exact face as Sue in the OP.	9
1	Good idea! I think a gated community would be perfect, because the guard has to call to let a guest in, so you can just pretend to not be home and not pick up.	9
1	No. Not okay.   Ask him if he did this. If he did this, tell him he was an asshole for doing so.	9
1	Money isn't everything - if you love the job a 10% raise is just a bonus!	9
1	Girl! My mom did this exact thing to me like two months ago! I'm graduating next spring with a bachelors in Mathematics and I've currently got a 3.76 GPA. And she's all, "I'm worried you're not going to graduate." It's beyond frustrating and I understand. Sorry you have to deal with that!	9
1	YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!  I'm so looking forward to that sweet, sweet day.   Congratulations!	9
1	"Praise be to RBG, may she live forever." Pretty sure this is now the official prayer of trollx.  Amen.	9
1	"Good idea! Maybe when he gets home from work I can bake him an apple pie, hand him his pipe and slippers, and then go puke in the bathroom so I can slim into a snappy new dress to!"  But no seriously, Doctor/Vet combo sounds unbeatable. Saving the world from all the things!	9
1	I doubt they care, considering they don't even bother putting their [models](http://media.kohls.com.edgesuite.net/is/image/kohls/1732417_Damask?wid=500&amp;hei=500&amp;op_sharpen=1) in the correct [sizes.](https://photovvebsite.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/gallery_enlarged-chelsea-salmon-pink-bra-01.jpg)	9

1	I will! Just...timing and feels :(  More than that, I would love to let my Dad live with me when he is old if I ever have a huge house or something, but I don't think he will ever leave her, even if she leaves in her RV and they're "still married."	9
1	I buy a bottle of wine because of every song.	9
1	My narcissist mother has mentioned that it would be GREAT if all her kids and grandkids moved in with her when they get enough money to get a HUGE house!  No, thanks. My brother, sister, and sisters-in-law may have consumed the Kool-Aid, but not I.	9
1	Did he? I mean, dude can talk some game but he best deliver! Cunnlingus don't fuck around, literally!	9
1	In all honesty, my IUD insertion was a cakewalk. I barely felt it, and the cramps I had afterward were about on par with my regular period cramps.	9
1	That is fucking metal as fuck	9
1	This lady is dumb on so many levels. Even putting aside the sexism, how does she know your husband doesn't like what you picked up? And what kind of reaction was she expecting? Did she think you were going to thank her for advise?	9
1	To be fair that banana is a bit green. I like my bananas young but that's just too much.	9
1	u gonna eat that?	9
1	I may have just fallen in love with your husband.	9
1	they all say that.	9
1	I was the same. I spent my appointment making my doctor laugh so hard she couldn't talk for a minute, I winced a bit when they opened me up, and that was it. I think I maybe took some ibuprofen before hand because they told me to?  I'm not always lucky, but pain tolerance and ideal outcomes are in my corner for this one. I haven't had a period because of it for...well, since Sept. 2012. That part of my life is awesome lol.	9
1	RBG you the real MVP :')	9
1	Oh I wish that was my experience! Glad it was so smooth for you! :)	9
1	Haha, yes! I'm 34I and it's a nightmare. Don't you love the it when you find a website with those sizes, but charges a restocking fee for returned items because they don't want you to buy several sizes to try on and determine which one fits?  Luckily, I found a specialty store that did a great fitting. I managed to find two styles of bras that fit correctly and *comfortably*. So now I just buy only those two styles. And one of them even came out in some new colors last year!	9

1	I would just really appreciate it if the fitter at Victoria's Secret didn't try to convince me that I could just go 3 cup sizes too small by getting a band that is three sizes too big. The "sister sizes" can work in some situations, but certainly not by that much. They should have just been honest and told me that they don't have anything that will work for me.	9
1	I see you (or your fiance) like your bananas appropriately (read: very) green. Taste better that way, I keep telling my bf that but he likes em all brown spotted and shit.	9
1	You're husband is freakin' awesome!	9
1	Awww; you should still get one at some point, screw nana! I know it's not much consolation from some internet comment, but I *know* you can rock a good dress and look cute!	9
1	I decided that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was my hero when I saw her nodding off at this year's State of the Union address. She later admitted she was dozing off because she was a little bit drunk. I was proud of her for doing what she was going to do and not giving a fuck about it. One day I hope to also achieve the precious glory of not giving a fuck.	9

1	You prefer them spotted?	9
1	yeah, as someone else said above, pain is relative. i am covered in tattoos, but i think if i were to get an IUD i would probably barf. even during my gyno visits, getting a pap smear is excruciating, i couldn't tell you why. it's like my vagina can sense non-dick entities and clams up. pun intended.	9
1	Oh my God, why did so many of you trolls pass out? I was going to get one this month and now I'm totally petrified that I'll pass out! ...Still gonna do it, doe.	9

1	That smug look they get when you notice. Like hehe you involuntary fondled me. I also get the "honey come here for a sec" and he's doing the helicopter dick.	9
1	Sure! But now I regret making that comment because I'm hungry and my hotdog place doesn't deliver this late.	9

1	HA. You and me are very much alike. Covered in tats, but paps make me sick. So IUD was really bad. But I know I keep saying it, but it was worth it. Wouldn't do it again though LOL.	9
1	It's called a vasovagal response and is completely normal when it happens. You may not experience it at all! But even if you do, the pain is very quick and after you just relax on the table for 10 min or so you'll be okay. I treated myself to a whole pint of Ben &amp; jerrys cookie dough ice cream after that. Worth it!!	9
1	Find out who your true friends are.	9
1	Well Angelkiss2007, I guess you and I are just some bad bitches. Cheers to us and our badass pain tolerances. May our massive ovaries take us far!	9
1	I love this, my husband does similar stuff as well and its always when I am gaming and trying to focus on something intense.  Sometimes he will just walk up and put his balls/dick on my shoulder and be like "whats up? whatcha doin'?". Or he will been standing off to the side, just where I can see out of the corner of my eye, and pull it out and start trying to helicopter it.	9
1	He was at work when I asked. He likes green, I like freckled.	9
1	Hey I just met you, and this is crazy, but your bum looks awesome, so call me maybe...	9
1	Oh I was hopin you had found a miracle cure... 😐	9
1	Next they'll be wanting 44 female presidents in a row to make up for the first 44 male ones.	9
1	maybe one day i might, but i'll beg my bf to get snipped before that ever happens, haha!	9
1	I just saw someone today with one side each color. It was amazing! Regardless, I'm on the same boat. Everyone thinks I need their approval	9
1	You'll dye your hair for a random stranger when Santino wins a sewing competition and Visage wears a fucking turtleneck! Toots for the Bianca reaction gif, always love seeing them here.	9
1	Hey if he's willing I don't blame ya!	9
1	One time I said I didn't think I could be polyamourous. I was very clear that I'm totally cool with people who are. Got down voted like cray :(	9
1	My elderly uncle-inlaw did something similar.  uncle: "Why do you let her dye her hair funny colors &lt;husband&gt;?  hubby: *laughs hysterically*  me: *laughs even harder*  Said uncle is much more open minded after knowing me for nearly 10 years now.	9
1	[Shhhhhhhhhh](http://i.imgur.com/m0kJ5Jl.gif)	9
1	Lol, I remember a bit like that from Nick Swardsons stand up. Luckily i haven't had dick wrist yet. When I'm playing league and winning or I do a good play he goes " Yay booboo yay good job!!" and SHAKES ME.  WHYYYYYYYYY. I love him.	9
1	That's some dumb logic. I'd rather be able to do whatever I want now than have kids earlier and have free time when I'm old because I'll be old and it's probably gonna suck.	9
1	Haha! When I play Dota it can get bad. Hell do it and be like honey do you know what time it is with his dick on my wrist and I won't even respond. Or I've said time for you to put on some pants. I think that's love. Using your genitals to annoy, not just pleasure, each other.	9
1	Taking tap-to-pay to the next level.	9
1	Thatll be a Buzzfeed article " 11 ways to annoy your partner with your genitals"^via^reddit	9
1	I get that skinny jeans is good, but is the sweaty going in the pro or con column?	9
1	I hope your husband can continue to be amazing!	9
1	I hope this becomes a comment thing on this sub, we're all just sending texts to our boyfriends asking for pictures of fruit. Eventually there's going to be a post in r/sex titled, "my girlfriend keeps asking for pictures of my banana, I think she has a fruit fetish what do I do??"	9
1	I hope when you're a gay, black man you have a Kimmy that treats you like this!	9
1	I'll take that.	9
1	Well it caused his shirt to cling to his body, so plus. Maybe I'm just crazy, but I find it sexy.	9
1	[uuuuuuuhn even reading about it makes me feel woozy...](https://33.media.tumblr.com/a6fc18467c1729b71b85b28df18f96ba/tumblr_inline_nnac7tdZSE1rez99z_500.gif)	9
1	Like a wet T-shirt competition, but he's the only one playing. :)	9
1	It's not like she/he didn't get a raise. 10% is a pretty damn good raise.	9
1	If I'm reading something on my phone, I hear him stamp the ground lightly. Then a bit louder. I look over and he does a jumping cock thrust, with his pants around his knees.  Gawd, I'm glad he's not a redditor.	9
1	That would be a wonderful commercial. I would buy that bra just to support good advertising.	9
1	Oh girl, this is G-rated compared to most stuff, you don't need to tag it! Also, that is very much akward penguin, but, good on you. You weren't comfortable, you walked (ran :p) away. That's the better situation than you going through with something and not feeling well about it. Proud of you! &lt;3	9
1	That was really cool of him. As for you, you shouldn't feel bad at all. Don't do something you're not comfortable with it ready for yet.	9
1	A **year**????	9
1	Yes, that's what always gets me. Sometimes I just look around a room and try to figure out who's the secretly bigoted ones. I will literally be having a conversation with someone and I'll be thinking "hmm I wonder if they think women should dress more modestly if they don't want to be raped" or "what if they have read red pill stuff and agreed?" It drives me crazy	9
1	Aw, man. Years ago, I had some upper-respiratory thing some kind of gross drainage that was LEAKING FROM MY EAR, plus what I believe was pink eye. I went to quick care and when the doctor asked what was wrong, I moaned, "I'm a mess!" He laughed sympathetically and said, "You *are* a mess, I'm sorry." Then he gave me meds and I was better in like three days; thank God for modern medicine.  I hope you're better soon, OP. That sounds miserable. :(	9
1	Men and their dicks. Just another toy I guess haha	9
1	A bunch of us got food poisoning at a friend's bridal shower (I felt SO BAD for her -- she was mortified). I lost so much weight; I remember wishing the wedding was the following weekend because I'd be so skinny/fit my dress no problem! Even so, 10/10 do not recommend that method of weight loss. Ugh.	9
1	It's reduced to $48.37 in Canada.  So I guess it's a couple dollars more expensive in Australia.	9
1	I had a conversation with my hairstylist about this (actually while she was putting blue and purple in my hair!) and she gets a surprising number of women that mention how they'd love to cut their hair short/dye their hair/whatever but their husbands won't let them change it.  It made me so sad.  I get wanting to look attractive for your SO, but not at the expense of being told what is and is not allowed.  Luckily mine is great - and I think if anything was hoping I'd come back with MORE bright colors in my hair haha.	9
1	I asked my BF once if he liked my clothes and style and he said "No, of course not." And I was hurt for a bit then a second later he said "because I like you naked the best."	9
1	As much as I agree that brown spotted bananas are disgusting (except for banana bread), I do appreciate the bf as a garbage disposal/portable compost heap function.	9
1	ouch ouch ouch ouch squished boob alert 0_0	9
1	yeah and none of this "smaller band size than a 34 or 32 and you're SOL" nonsense. Also larger cups sizes (aka anything bigger than a C), that don't look ugly or matronly would be awesom. Being a 30E makes VS adds physically painful.	9
1	Ah yes... the benis.	9
1	Only you can decide that.  Personally "invisible makeup that just makes you look flawless" and "very obvious makeup that makes you like a beautiful bird/clown/flower/beautiful-colorful-thing" are both totally valid and awesome skills. It still amazes me that I'm allowed to decide which or neither I prefer.	9
1	To be fair though, harassment and domestic violence aimed at men is desperately under reported so he has a point. Men's issues are certainly important too. Plus this guy wasnt even being a jerk about it. If you truly want 'social justice and equality for all' you can't just laugh at someone asking for attention to be paid to real issues.	9
1	Hi puddin'  So let's talk about this. I legitimately want to be here for you.   But... can we also talk about why things like feelings-dumps are usually a bad idea, why we don't call women 'females', and what's up with ordering an audience of predominately women to do their kegels? There are some red flags here, and [i have some concerns](http://orig06.deviantart.net/0258/f/2015/104/2/a/baymax_adipose_ript_by_artbymikaelak-d8pqd84.png)	9
1	My friend group that lives in the PNW is all people between 28 and 35 and none of us have kids. People I went to high school with that stayed back home have 4 kids. I can't even imagine.	9
1	Yeah, I always just tell people that I am the only person to get me off, and not to take that as a challenge.	9
1	i dont care how awesome those shoes supposedly are  I will never not laugh at vibrams or whatever they're called  .. so this picture is doubly funny to me!	9
1	Also it's on Spotify and spelled Peeno Noir	9
1	As both an actor and a gamer, I know this one. Don't do it. Enjoy each and every moment of this crush, and let her go her merry way. If you do anything, you *will* fuck it up.  Oh, have I fucked up ...	9
1	The other day I said 'I'm not interested in continuing this conversation' and hung up, I felt like a complete bad ass on account of my horrible fear of confrontation. But seriously, don't call me trying to sell something and then get aggressive in two different languages just because I'm not interested!	9
1	I'm ashamed to say my first thought was "but *is* that too far?" and then I realised that they are, and have almost exclusively always been all-men...	9
1	IS HE WEARING TOE SHOES?	9
1	Did the Avengers just impregnate you!?	9
1	If you still want to go somewhere that's French, but where nobody will ever find you, Belgium's still on the table...	9
1	We should start a coven. Tattos, piercings...meh. I clench up 3 weeks ahead of any pap test. And my body devices that it was going to revolt against the IUD. Had to have it removed. One of the most horrible vaginal experiences in my life.	9
1	I put some purple in my hair and sent a picture of it to the guy I'm seeing asking if he liked the color purple. His response was "Yeah but the important thing is if you like it". I was actually taken aback, and then immediately got super turned on....	9
1	More like "Saving all the things from the world!"	9
1	**SHE'S** **GLARING** **AT** **ME** **WHILE** **SQUINTING!** **I** **THINK** **SHE'S** **TRYING** **TO** **STAY** **AWAKE** **SINCE** **I'VE** **DONE** **IT** **THREE** [**TIMES!**](http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m85e8mw00m1rqfhi2o1_250.gif)	9
1	I usually hope people get to realize their dreams, but not your mom.	9
1	I don't know any guys who surprise their SO with helicopter dick, which leads me to the conclusion that I need better guy friends.	9
1	Well, you could talk to her. You don't need to make a move (i.e. Randomly lunge at her face). But you could try to have a conversation. Do you know what her preference is? Ultimately, it doesn't have to hurt your friendship, and it doesn't have to be forever. It might clear some things up, and you won't have to obsess about the, "one who got away."  P.S. Don't listen to me because I am also drunk. But do listen to me because I'm speaking directly from the feels. And stuff.	9
1	&gt; and she gets a surprising number of women that mention how they'd love to cut their hair short/dye their hair/whatever but their husbands won't let them change it  [Holy shit, that is actually a thing?](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/007/784/what-year-is-it-robin-williams.jpg)	9
1	It's 100 times better to do a job you adore for less pay than a job you dislike with good pay. I did the latter for 3 years and I never felt so dead inside. Never regretted moving on to something more passionate with less pay.	9
1	My Aunty is always talking about how she'd like to dress up and make an effort more but doesn't see the point if her husband doesn't appreciate it! While I get that it's nice if your effort is appreciated, I only dress for myself so I feel good, if my SO likes it then that's cool too but no big deal if he doesn't :/	9
1	Gotta love 'em...  http://i.imgur.com/P5gCc9C.png	9
1	Somebody once told me "my dream is to show America how much trouble they've caused by being accepting of homosexuality." Bewildered, after collecting my thoughts I said "wow Im so glad that will literally never happen." They gave me a shocked look and stomped away. Some dreams aren't meant to come true.	9
1	We clean our toilet/bathroom once a week, sometimes more...	9
1	Taylor Swift is my spirit animal	9
1	Well it depends what your aim is or how perceptive people are. If you're going for a natural look with natural colors and shades it can be hard for someone not experienced with make-up to tell weather or not you're wearing it. On the other hand if you're standing there with purple lips and golden eyelids (don't ask me to color coordinate) and someone tells you they can't tell that you're wearing make-up I'd either question your make-up skills or that person's eyes.	9
1	I told my FWB the same thing, and that was his exact response.  [My own reaction](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbbtz4AgvM1qd90gl.gif) (despite your very enjoyable efforts, FWB, I don't see it happening).	9
1	Blasphemy! They're only perfectly sweet when lightly spotted ^^^dick.	9
1	SEPT 2012?! My god, that's magical	9
1	"as a man".   There are probably several top comments from guys who also found it hilarious but he's the only one who felt compelled to inform us that he was a man.   I didn't downvote him but I might have on a different day.	9
1	&gt; ba...ba..banana for scale...  FTFY	9
1	If there were a lot of negative comments in the thread, or if I were feeling uncharitable, or if he had a bunch of additional comments telling us how ladies be on their periods... Why do we do what we do?	9
1	Congrats! The day I moved in with my SO life got a thousand times sweeter; hope the same happens for you!	9
1	Beautiful seahorse-shrimp cake! 10/10, would buy	9
1	"I'm a fruitless fruit tree sis!"  But no really, I get that a lot to from friends and some relatives. It's almost creepy because it's like they're treating it as if you have zero choice in the matter, it's just going to happen. Like it's a written in stone destiny, like you're in an RPG following a plot.  Maybe everyone she knows has changed, but that's not to say you're everyone else. Anecdotes aren't the most consistent thing.	9
1	I keep my makeup mostly "natural" looking, but I rock winged eyeliner everyday.   My boss (male) was once like "but you don't wear makeup"... Shocked. What? I'm a blonde. See these eyebrows? These eyelashes? I did not wake up with these.   Good to know I'm fooling people though. But the winged eyeliner? What? I wish.	9
1	I know! And the funny thing is, I can't even get pregnant and live! That's not to say I couldn't adopt, or that that's my reason for not wanting kids, it's just a fact about me and kind of works out since I've never liked kids, I can't handle them whatsoever, I tried baby sitting and I just couldn't imagine, even if they were *my* kids. Just, not for me.	9
1	Oh God that did it for me to, and then there was the wood chopping scene....bless you Whedon, bless you.	9
1	Praise be unto him. I mean he deserves it for ever putting Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Tom Hiddleston and Robert Downey Jr in the same movie anyway.	9
1	Right?! And I'm bi so I'm crushing hard on Scarlett Johansson too and Mark Ruffalo is cute and awesome as a person *and* as the Hulk! Really I would just like to have an Avengers orgy (even with the new recruits)!	9
1	Asking the important questions! I too would like to know if he is wearing toe shoes.	9
1	It was suppose to be my mom. I'll try harder next time!	9
1	When normal raises at my job are 2-3%, yea, 10% is awesome! Get it girl! I got an 8% this year and I was stoked :)	9
1	ScarJo was one of my first female celebrity crushes when I was figuring out that I am bi. &lt;3 her.   Orgy might be fun but I have a sneaking suspicion Hiddleston is probably precisely my kind of guy when it comes to fucking.	9
1	Um, what?? Are they stuck in medieval times? My gf has gone ahead and dyed her hair purple (looks red to me, though), and while I can give my opinion, she doesn't need to ask my permission. If a guy's going to be so petty as to tell her what color to dye her hair (or not do it all it), he doesn't deserve a wife.	9
1	Lol my boyfriend does this. I'll ask him how I look and he always tells me I look better naked	9
1	As a Brit, having Chris Evans holding my breasts is not an attractive selling point.	9
1	I'd...I'd like to know how you mean	9
1	It actually makes it so much harder when they try SO HARD.  Side story: I had a gentleman performing cunnilingus on me a few months ago and everything was great but I did not come. He attempted to convince me that I had. Butch, it's my vagina, I know when I come!	9
1	This happens all the time! My sister wanted to get a cute stacked asymmetrical bob with some red in it I think, but her husband really doesn't like short hair, and had mentioned that to her hairstylist before. SO THE HAIRSTYLIST DIDNT DO IT. She gave her a long Bob (8 inches longer than my sister wanted) with reddish hi lights and actually said "there, you're husband will like that!" My sister is actually friends with this lady too and was pissed at her husband for saying something.	9
1	Do you by any chance live in 1950s Alabama	9
1	I genuinely think they put lots of it in because they know the movies are popular with us ladies. There was so much male eye-candy!	9
1	OMG this is totally slaying me. I'm sitting here crying laughing over the god damn fruit smoothie I'm having for lunch. I feel you, little otter bro.	9
1	Hairstylist here. I've only been behind the chair for a little over nine months, and I've lost count of how many women (and a few men) have said this. If the SO is there, usually tell them the story of how I gave myself a buzz cut and then texted my boyfriend saying "I did a thing" with a bit of a "she could do this and there's nothing you can do about it" smile. It also helps that I have a bright purple mohawk.	9
1	Kiss him really hard. Kiss him right on the dick. That was my plan of action anyway when I had a discussion with my fiancé about tattoos (he was quite firmly against before me). Now when we have a few financial things out of the way, he's gonna be helping me find the best artist :D  Apparently as long as I don't ask him to get one, we're golden. Perfect  :)	9
1	I feel your pain. I have relatives in town this week and in two days I've gotten 3 lectures about how I should be in school and one about how much I'll want children "when I'm more mature".	9
1	It sounds to me like they've been living together, not that it's been a year since they've cleaned it.  I *hope*...	9
1	The level of nerdiness in this post, man... I need to get on your level.  Good luck figuring it out!	9
1	It would make me sad if it were higher. I love most of the men in my life, and don't feel they're beneath me at all. Of course, I'm not beneath them either! As long as that's clear....men are great. I feel like this sub usually does a great job of being woman-affirming without acting like we're superior by virtue of our genitals.	9
1	I wanna see it!!!!!	9
1	I just think that if I saw that on trolly 60% of them were up voting things that said women were inferior that I would feel like it was a terribly mysoginistic place...	9
1	Man, those mic clouds are the weirdest rain clouds... Only appear when someone gets told. Only drops one mic...	9
1	ohhh. I thought you were sad because 60% was too low. No, I'd much rather have it down voted to oblivion. I feel you.	9
1	I am so sorry.  That was extremely inconsiderate of her.	9
1	my boyfriends dicks is small and doesn't get boners as quickly as I'd like but he really puts the work in so I can't complain. and sex is like 70% mental. she sucks.	9
1	When someone doesn't want to be in a relationship or whatever anymore so they "fade" you from their life	9
1	That must have been such a relief! You go girl! :)	9
1	It seems like a southern thing (at least in the US.) The farther north you go the longer people wait. I know one person my age (mid twenties) who got married. They don't have kids. No one else I know is planning on tying the knot till their mid thirties at the soonest.	9
1	sounds like it's time for a new gf.	9
1	Awesome! Glad you have a supportive mother. Congratulations!	9
1	They like it only when they asked for it.	9
1	So dorky!  Just kidding, I love his puns	9
1	When my husband surprises me with the helicopter dick, I enjoy it for a few seconds and then tell him, "Now go the other way." He can only do it clockwise, so when he has to do it the other way he looks all confused and it kind of just slaps his balls. It's a whole fun show from start to finish.	9
1	omg you have a winner there. Right there keep that one.	9
1	I am sorry.  That was an A-1 shitty thing to do.  Ditch her.	9
1	It comes in waves. I remember when I was 21 and the first round of marriages happened. Now I'm 27. A lot of my friends are getting divorced. I'm just sitting here getting a PhD.	9
1	He's so damn sad to be eating that watermelon, but he keeps eating the watermelon and my poor heart is exploding.	9
1	Way to go, OP!  [Time to celebrate!](http://media.giphy.com/media/5MSZriF2MMe9q/giphy.gif)	9
1	Just saying, you wouldn't have a problem with a butch (or any other sort of lady lover). They at least know when you come/don't come.   *I'll walk my queer ass out now*	9
1	Of course he has a point in that there are a lot of very serious issues that affect men. However, if the author has chosen to focus on some of the issues that women face, then there is nothing wrong with that either - pick your battles and all that.  He seems to be acting kinda jerky in a passive aggressive way by subtly accusing the author of not caring about men's issues.  The lacking context makes it hard to determine exactly what is going on though, but that is the impression that I am getting.	9
1	She sounds kind of rude to be honest... How do you have foot-in-mouth disorder?	9
1	Oh my gosh, yes.	9
1	Yes! Good for you for saving your money! Once you feel like you have enough saved for your rainy day/ emergency fund, start investing your money, and turn that money into more money. (Sorry if you're already doing this, and if you are, even better off for you!)	9
1	Did... did she pay for that?	9
1	Agreed. That makes it seem like a place that supports peoples skewed views of feminism. ie females&gt;males	9
1	I don't know how to invest! I'm definitely going to learn, though. I've been able to figure out how to pay all of my bills, save up to move into a new apartment by the end of next month, and still have $500 of spending/savings/emergency fund left over *every month.* After a few months, I want to be able to make investments like a real adult!	9
1	It makes me sad that Tumblr screenshots are all over the whole damn internet now. It's not exactly creative and I'm fed up with it.  Also yes this post is shitty. We want to promote equality, dammit.	9
1	I have a soon to be MIL that I bend over backwards for, but behind the doors she isn't all that impressed with me because of reasons that are impossible to change. I guess what I'm saying is, if your boyfriend's mom is like that, don't stop being nice and friendly, just don't let her opinion of you affect the way you feel about yourself. I wish I'd learned that a couple of years ago! I was like why don't you like me I do all the things for you!! But I don't know anything about your bf's mom, she might be awesome.	9
1	LMAO! That's cruel and awesome.	9
1	That is awesome that you're taking care of yourself and doing some self-pampering; that is just the best way to move on from that kind of thing and keep yourself motivated and in good spirits. I'm proud of you!	9
1	Oh yeah. I fell into this category until about 3 months ago sadly. I woke up one too many mornings with my hair wrapped around my neck like a noose and had enough. I arrived to pick him up from work and my hair was 8 inches shorter, perm mostly cut off, and hair straightened. His jaw almost hit the floor in a good way.   I think he's been "told" his whole life that long hair is sexy to the extent that he was blinded to the shorter hairstyles. He's been cured of that misconception and no more late night choking for me. :D	9
1	Yeah, but she went back a week later and got the cut and color she wanted for free. She didn't say anything at first because of that awkward "well maybe she knows better and this is what looks better for my face" feeling. But then her husband said something along the lines of "good Im glad she listened to me." So my sis said fuck that and got what she wanted anyways. :)	9
1	Where did she find these magical socks?	9
1	Well, sounds like you have a bad case of being human.  Seriously though, I'm going grey at 25 and am thanking my stars for it as it means I'm not balding like my father did at my age. See it as an opportunity to go full Caitlin Moran.	9
1	Sometimes, the worst breakups, you do all your mourning and \*aching-for long before you cut the cord.  Sucky to lead up to, but it's pretty much sweet freedom from that point. :D	9
1	"These photos are noteworthy because the otter is crying while eating watermelon."  Yup, sounds just like when I'm trying to eat very healthy during shark week and I'd rather have a pizza, that's basically me while eating a salad or.. Anything that isn't pizza.	9
1	Maybe you should find someone whose measure of a person isn't in their pants. She does not sound like someone I'd want around.	9
1	OMG I want a penguin onesie pajamas	9
1	Me too. I just hope she'll still be this understanding when I start wearing bras.	9
1	It took me over a decade of sexual activity to figure out how to cum from cunnilingus. Until then I would just eventually fake it so they wouldn't keep trying &amp; trying which would just lead me to feeling self conscious. Then one day, it was the perfect time of day, the perfect amount of soft sunlight, the perfect amount of quiet breeze, the perfect amount of no-responsibility lazy day, the perfect amount of no expectation, &amp; BAAAMMMMM. Once it happened accidentally I was able to let myself get into the right mindset to let it happen almost every time, in almost every situation/environment. Sometimes that shit takes time.	9
1	It was. I still worry she'll have issues with my trans-ness later but at least it's a start.	9
1	HELP I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ADULT.  But jokes aside I'm 22, about to be out of college, and don't know how to invest either. Care to give a few tips or even a little write up on how to start?	9
1	They look like Blue Q socks. :) If stores by you don't carry their stuff, they have a website: http://www.blueq.com	9
1	The tone of this sub has changed dramatically. It also used to be funny and now it feels like most every other women-based sub. Bums me out.	9
1	I don't think this is supposed to be taken at face-value though. I mean, I see the other comments talking about feminism and men not being inferior to women etc, I think this was very obviously supposed to be taken as a joke. I took it more as a "I'm the shit, I am beyonce" Kind of thing. I like it and I most certainly don't think all men are beneath me. Just seems a little uptight to think this is actually implying men are inferior.	9
1	Okay, I'm super unqualified to be offering any sort of advice, but I've heard /r/personalfinance is a great sub!	9
1	I have long hair because my husband likes it. :/ He doesn't *demand* me to wear it like that, holy cow, of course not. But yeah, he is the reason my hair is long. Sometimes I wonder if that is "ok", but I actually really don't care that much about my hair style one way or the other, so I guess I can do him the favour?	9
1	would you be ok with seeing this in trolly?  "why do i get so flustered around cute girls? It's like I forget that all women are beneath me"	9
1	That's so annoying to me as an introvert. Yes, I prefer to be alone, but that doesn't mean I don't want to hang out with people!	9
1	My son was sick the day before, I thought I was fine since I had no symptoms...I may have misjudged. I was lucky, it could have been worse. It could have happened when I tripped, haha.	9
1	Is he stoned? That's the most random combination of food I've heard.	9
1	OMFG I nearly spit out my coffee.	9
1	So what did you order and what did you eat?	9
1	I agree with you. Its a joke and its funny because the idea of thinking yourself to be above an entire gender is utterly absurd.	9
1	This is very toxic to our community and we should not support it here. Men are equal to women, not beneath.	9
1	Inquiring minds want to know!	9
1	Everyone seems to love that sub but I must need an eli3 version. The advice seems pretty straight forward, but I never understand *why* they choose what they choose....	9
1	Even as a joke those are two different contexts because of how the current social dynamic positively effects men. Ergo, as a joke: "All men are beneath me" has a completely different meaning than, "All women are beneath me" because of the situation at large.   I have trouble imagining, "No Punching" as a comedic rule(in comparison to "Punch up, not down") creating any social commentary on the situation. This kind of seems like a huge, internalized, "What about the men" situation.	9
1	I feel like it's important to have relationships with people in your life that will eat the foods you don't like. From my SO to my BFFs, we compliment each other in that way.  Waste not want not.	9
1	Thank you! Today I'm getting a mani pedi, which I've already accounted for in my budget! I'm a little lonely. We didn't break up on bad terms and I do miss seeing him, but I also feel really good about the future! I hope it lasts.	9
1	That means that arbitrarily swapping genders isn't a useful tool for evaluating humor that is based on a currently unequal power dynamic. "All men are beneath me" and "All women are beneath me" are two different jokes through that lense and comparing them is unfair and plays directly into derailing the commentary because we're more worried about hurting the egos of men than we are empowering women.	9
1	I think that is what happened. We discussed how we were going to move forward and fix our issues for years it seems. We were just holding onto this thing we had that was so familiar but keeping us stagnant. I cried and argued so much before we even broke up that now I'm just ready to move forward on my own.	9
1	I'm glad that your budget includes a [treat yo self](http://i.imgur.com/LCC4J.gif) fund :)	9
1	And THAT is how you send a dick pic without being laughed at. Simple supply and demand, dudes.	9
1	If you're that hard up just Google "big penis", girl	9
1	I think this post kinds adds to that. Instead of being silly we're getting up in arms. I just wanna cheer people on for good sex and commiserate with you when things get awkward!	9
1	You made her cum twice from oral? I'll be your girlfriend	9
1	I'm sure that in the 10-20 minutes they had to wait for food, they didn't just entirely forget what they had ordered. That doesn't usually happen.	9
1	That would make wayyyyy more sense, but I think this is his way for clearing out the pantry to go grocery shopping this afternoon. I don't even know sometimes.	9
1	Both versions are bad (as jokes or otherwise), but they're not equivalent. She's just asking you to consider the social context of each of them. Like it would be different if a vast majority of positions of power in the US and the world were held by women instead of men. In that scenario, a woman saying "men are beneath me" would be worse than a man saying "women are beneath me". Capisce?	9
1	&gt;We were just holding onto this thing we had that was so familiar  This is so true and happens all the time. Good for you for moving forward and good luck!	9
1	I'm sorry, but if someone took stuff out of my cart *anywhere* I'd lose it. That is so rude!	9
1	The thrift store I go to has a sale for every major holiday. The last one I went to was th St. Patrick's Day sale, and someone took a movie I had picked out while I wasn't looking. :(	9
1	This is exactly how I'm feeling right now. I've known my daughter's father was planning on moving out for a few months and I have been utterly devastated and thought when he moved out I would be completely unable to function. He moved out about 3 days ago and I haven't shed a tear since the few I let slip when he was leaving. I feel so free and positive right now. I hope this isn't the calm before the storm, but I'm enjoying my baby, my freedom, and my alone time.	9
1	You meant ex, right? Ditch that girl..	9
1	mm did someone say steak?	9
1	Dad jokes. Husband him!	9
1	It can hurt a bit when you notice the places he's absent, but don't worry - the worst is already over. Everything you do from this point onward is for you and your daughter, and having that sense of certainty makes even the hardest times easier to bear.	9
1	That was so nice of you to order for each other. ^ - ^	9

1	Now for another brain-shock: Imagine the supreme court full of all black people. Or all Mexican-Americans. Or all Chinese-Americans.	9
1	Like actually laughed, like laugh, laugh? with noise and such stuff. Like a sound kinda thing. That's fucked up man. Judging from your username we should hang out though.	9
1	God, what a [terrible person](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/yuck.gif)	9
1	Not necessarily. I wanted absolutely nothing to do with children or marriage. I was adamant that I was going to live in Vegas with my cat, alone.  But then I met my fiance and over the course of the relationship, my opinion changed and now I'm looking forward to having a family. He's going to be the stay-at-home parent and I'll be the breadwinner so that definitely helps.  Some people change, and that's okay. Some people don't and that's also okay. Telling people their choice is invalid is not okay.	9
1	It's okay to be okay. It's also okay if later you're not okay, because you will be okay again. ::hugs:: Kudos to your for your productive solutions and cheers for your happiness!	9
1	If you wanna see Chris Evans with a beard (no skin though), check out Snowpiercer. It's also probably his best performance.	9

1	I've never seen the words "finally" and "dick pic" used together in the same sentence myself.	9
1	This troll understands the ins and outs of okay!	9
1	At this point, I support a high percentage of the budget going to treat yo self!	9
1	I ordered these tofu sesame tacos with sesame fries and she ordered a bulgogi quesadilla. Turns out I really don't like sesame or sweet fries, but she does.	9
1	The lord's kiss.	9
1	Yes! This happened with a best friend of mine. I had already lost her as a friend, it just wasn't official. When it was, I was shocked just how good it felt. It's been six months and I still feel great. My therapist told me it might take a while to hit me, but I think I grieved the relationship while I was technically still in it.	9
1	I'm pretty sure that not liking Taylor Swift is the first sign that someone is the anti-christ.	9
1	Are you going to tell her?	9
1	Tried, he claimed he did so I was going to follow up on facebook because I can't trust a word he says but by the time I tried they had both blocked me. I could probably find another way if I put a lot of effort into it but I'm just so done with him and anything having to do with him.	9
1	I wanted to downvote this for the Gf's reaction. :(	9
1	Ended a 6 year relationship last summer, and was then on/off for about 6 months. It's over now, and I'm really enjoying ME time. It's a little sad every now and then-- even though the relationship didn't work, I feel nostalgic for some old habits. Enjoy being single! After long term relationships, it's refreshing to experience things as a single person.	9
1	Seriously, there's a whole subreddit devoted to dick, tasty, tasty dick. ;)	9
1	Everything's coming up Millhouse! Congrats :D	9
1	He either told her the truth, told a lie about you to her, or he blocked you on her facebook himself.  I'm sorry you had to go through that. Keep that text message in case she comes to you about it. You never know what he may or may not have said.	9
1	Thanks, I was seriously having an awesome day before the free ice-cream. I almost cried when the little screen popped saying "Congratulations! You have passed your test!" Then me and my mommy got blueberry pancakes at IHOP.	9
1	Chub rub is a legit reason to get back in shape.	9
1	You're my hero. I'm about to hit the phase where I've got the diet on lockdown, but need to start hitting the gym. I'm more of a suplex girl myself. Black Friday at Sephora is going to be awesome this year.	9
1	From one language geek to another, your flair is amazing...	9
1	I snapchatted this clip to my friends today because I love it so much.   I'm definitely calling cats hairy babies from now on :)	9
1	It's amazing it took this long. Good on the guy for knowing when it's warranted!	9
1	Uggghhh I hate when people say "boys will be boys"... I had an ex who embodied this phrase and he would actually say it out loud to excuse whatever terrible thing he did. Ex for a reason.	9
1	Do you know how proud he is of that joke? Because that was actually so good by proxy I'm proud of that joke. You two sound adorable.	9
1	[Thanks!](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/b3/a4/ab/b3a4abbb0f967b3b6d4fe7a6ae7e7957.jpg)	9
1	Here is an example of a [troll in the wild](http://i.imgur.com/9mUvnJp.gif).	9
1	I feel the exact same way! My first love and I broke up about 3 days ago and I feel so great. I'm still sad cause I feel like I'm mourning something that was once great but now I'm just excited to take on the world and not be dragged down a relationship that had obviously run its course. We're gonna be okay :)	9
1	yeah unfortunately.. and it had a picture with him in the library holding a bottle of jack as the cover..	9
1	My poor jeans' inner thighs don't even know what hit them.	9
1	My mum posted me these silk pajama bottoms completely out of the blue. I've never felt fancier.	9
1	You know people can exercise without going to a gym, right?	9
1	You may be stuck with the chub rub regardless. I have skinny friends who are still plagued by it. It's partly how your hips are set, not just how big your thighs are.  I've resigned myself to it. I've come to actually like my thunder thighs most days. They're strong as hell and are attached to my fine ass.	9
1	Nooooooo don't tell me that! I suppose I'll just have to hope for the best, lol.	9
1	They look fancy! And I bet they feel wonderful!	9
1	Yeah that's some bullshit; everybody deserves to know when it's off, that's closure for *both* people. It's literally the least any respectful human being can do in that situation. I'm sorry you got left hung out like that snarky :( *HUGSSS*	9
1	11/10 perfect freaking response. I'm still feeling the sting from that BURN.	9
1	Ugh, I hate that sort of thing. I've been a vegetarian for about a billion years and have frequently heard variations of, "Well, I guess that makes your boyfriend a vegetarian too, huh? ;D" No, actually, he's an adult who is perfectly capable of feeding himself.	9
1	FATALITY.   Feel better, OP. Treat yourself to everything you want today!	9
1	I can only recall two times in which I was super witty and can still remember the jokes to this day.   He will remember this for years to come, haha.	9
1	Takorea in Atlanta! And yes it was amazing.  The quesadilla anyway.	9
1	Oh HELL. NO. I'd smack a bitch.	9
1	[this is the first thing that came to mind](http://imgur.com/nRXqDIs)	9
1	What does this phrase actually mean? I've heard it said before, but never understood the context,	9
1	seriously. i live in a small town, and people claim they hate it all the time. I just remind them that this happens every 2-3 years and they shut up.	9
1	I'm not a huge fan, but damn her songs are catchy, so if I hear it on the radio, I don't mind. I don't seek her out though.	9
1	Miss Trinity K Bonet realness! Treat yourself :)	9
1	The Song That Doesn't End from Lambchop's Play Along is catchy, too...	9
1	Even when I was a size 2 at 5'7, I had chub rub. Fuck you too, hips and knock knees.	9
1	Usually it's used when boys beat the crap out of each other, feel up/touch a girl, or just in general be gross or annoying. It's a simultaneous reinforcement of gender roles (boys/men are aggressive, pursue the girl, are outspoken, etc) and a half-assed excuse for bad/inappropriate behavior. When I was in school I would hear some parents say that about their sons whenever they would get called for something they did like that.  It still pops up whenever there's a news story about a boy suspended for pulling down a girls panties or fighting or anything similar. "What happened to boys will be boys?!"	9
1	I've never been single as an adult. I started dating my now ex when I was 16. I am excited yet absolutely terrified to be single.	9
1	Wow. I had no idea that this was what that phrase meant.	9
1	I want your strength!	9
1	[Yes.](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc9waqBo1M1ri7upfo1_500.gif)	9
1	She... laughed at your small dick? ..........  If I had an SO that laughed at my small boobs or the look of my vagina or anything, I'd fucking leave their ass.	9
1	Yikes. Yeah, the fact that she blocked you means he might have told a defensive story. Be careful.	9
1	You can just tell her it's like Tina Fey's diary.	9
1	i love my boyfriend's short cock. fits perfectly in my mouth ;)   i hope you find someone better soon!	9
1	Exactly. I'm already ostracized and being bad mouthed.   What kills me is she complains to anyone who will hear it about how she doesn't get any help. We fucking tried dude!	9
1	Damn, a saturday special; two hookups, extra beef, hold the mayo (put it on the side)! Way to score!! And a Britney reference? Fucking *on point*!  *HIGH-FIVE*	9
1	It's not that they're never warranted, it's that the unwarranted ones are excessive.	9
1	Vas-y!  Tu peux le faire!  (édité parce que je n'ai même pas vu la faute.  QUELLE HORREUR)	9
1	[So many amazing quotes like this one- "Unlike women, men lose all power after they say “I do.” Their masculinity dies, too"](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/01/why-men-wont-marry/)	9
1	Think I'll pass on that but I'd hazard to guess it's a bunch of stereotypes, mixed with petty/unreasonable demands, gender roles, mixed with a couple genuinely bad character flaws that aren't exclusive to women or are pretty well agreed upon to be bad anyway.	9
1	Yup, nailed it.	9
1	you only have what you have inside you. you can't be lime anyone else. doesn't nean you can't do what they did with a bit of focus and commitment.  Good luck.	9
1	It can still be less and more severe chub rub based on weight, so even if it doesn't go away, it can be less awful for sure!  Source: my thighs at different times	9
1	Ugh, Evolution doesn't breed anything. And there is a way for boys and girls to compete without ripping each other apart; sports, grades, games, and competitions. And I want to make it clear the distinction between "playing with each other" wrestling (which still shouldn't be encouraged at school) and "beat the crap out of each other wrestling".  I don't get what prison has to do with this but I don't support reduced sentences based on gender (or race).	9
1	How did that happen?	9
1	This is the song that never ends....  Damn you. It is in my head now.	9
1	A lot of wine was involved.	9
1	This phrase is appropriate for when people get upset at boys for wanting to rough house, but people use it for pretty much all inappropriate behavior if a boy does it, and that's not cool	9
1	Women overwhelmingly haven't written the laws and going to prison is a punishment to begin with whereas telling boys they can do what they want because their boys is avoiding punishment or accountability altogether.	9
1	Wow. I don't think there was one sentence in that article that didn't piss me off.	9
1	Even if it was small. It wasn't a surprise dick pic, and he only sent them when approved and asked for.	9
1	That is hot! Shame it wasn't a full threesome, but you know what? DOESN'T MATTER; HAD SEX (Twice)!	9
1	Oh this reminds me of an incident when I was a sophomore in high school. I was sitting in study hall doing some homework and I was sitting next to a junior guy who was sitting next to a senior guy. The two guys knew each other through sports and sometimes would talk about sports. On the day of the incident, I was reading and had tuned out to their conversation then I see the junior guy slam into my desk and the guys swing fists. I get away and the teacher breaks it up and sends them both to the office. I think they got detention for the incident, I'm just glad I didn't get punched.	9
1	Hell yea! It was super fun. I kinda want to have a threesome with them but it would my first one and I'm not sure how to start that. More wine next time? Haha.	9
1	I thought this would have been a period story. *slightly disappointed* but hope you're okay.	9
1	[Wow](http://media3.giphy.com/media/artr28YUQ6S0o/giphy.gif)	9
1	I hate hearing about parents who treat their kids like house elves. Some chores are fine and expected, even healthy, but 6.5 hrs of yard work plus carpet shampooing and more? She should let you focus on school mostly. Eff that noise	9

1	Easiest thing to do is create a quick fake facebook profile and use it to message her. For all you know he may have gone onto her account and blocked you for her.	9
1	"since women can do everything men can do and better, thank you very much, feminism"  That was fun to read, in the same way movies like The Room and Snakes on a Plane are fun to watch.   Edit: so I know most people are not clicking on this. But you are missing out on a big ol' bucket of delusional craziness.  I went through her archives [here](http://www.foxnews.com/archive/suzanne-venker) Highlights include...  "women wake up men have made your life better not worse"  "To be happy we must admit women and men arent equal"  "Let's call a truce in the war on men"	9
1	Honestly, my legs felt unworthy of such luxury, so I just shaved them and put my fancy-pants back on. [This is me right now](http://media.giphy.com/media/GPvyTG8nwN4uk/giphy.gif).	9

1	You're going to be so motherfucking capable when you move out, and they're going to be left wondering why the dishes don't do themselves and how come the yard is so messy. Do what you gotta do until you can move out, and then you'll be the one succeeding super hard at life.	9
1	Good going on your guy being cool w it all.    You'll have to start again tonight. 😉	9
1	It's like a grope.  Unwanted ones are bad, wanted ones are good.  Never just send a dick pic, wait until it's asked for.	9
1	She's beautiful too. I really like her 40s look.	9
1	I have a friend who's son is very similar. I have noticed that the only help she wants is the help she decides she needs...   My friend is very much in denial about the severity of the issue.    I wish I had words of wisdom for you, but I can empathize.	9
1	To me - this sub feels like what I wish every friendship was...  Non judgmental, no subject is taboo, always someone around to lend an ear, funny, open to trying new thing, loves wine... I could go on and on.	9
1	This is definitely true. I'll never really be able to cut him out completely, because he's still her father and a good one at that, but I'm doing my darnedest to focus my time and energy on more important things, and it seems to be working. Thinking about him and missing him and how things were haven't done me any good in a long time.	9
1	Didn't most of her old music heavily feature slut-shaming? Doesn't seem very feminist to me (but I haven't heard her recent stuff).	9
1	&gt; I don't think liking T. Swift and being feminist have to go hand in hand at all.  I know, I was just making a reference to the "also not related to feminism at all" quote from Mean Girls:   &gt; Irregardless, ex-boyfriends are just off limits to friends. I mean that's just like the rules of feminism.  If someone accused me of not being a feminist because I don't particularly like Taylor Swift's music, I'd have a good laugh, and then gently inform them that the two are not contingent on one another at all.	9
1	That's clearly how people get Irritable Bowel Syndrome.	9
1	[Someone turned it into a 10 minute long clip. I don't think I can do it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tMO1uGA1G8)	9
1	Hah, the first thing he asked when he turned on the lights was "Are you on your period?!". But I'm on the pill, so I only ride the crimson tide when I choose to - and nights when I'm staying with the SO are not those nights!	9
1	I was fine the next day and I wasn't experiencing any pain, so I think it's okay! May have been just a little cut from his fingernail or something, I know I've done that to myself before when going solo.	9
1	Ah, now, hate is a strong word.	9
1	That's how I got it anyway. ^^^^(/s)	9
1	Text him "we're dating, right? Like bf and gf?"  Or, lick his face and tell him it means he is yours now.	9
1	I'd never been in that sort of awkward situation before, so I felt really embarrassed (I think I said "Sorry!" about 20 times). Luckily he's a pretty chill guy so he cheered me up - I'm very lucky! And don't worry, we definitely made it for it the next night!	9
1	Wow. Just wow. I read a little of it to my fiance and he asked me to stop reading because he couldn't take the stupidity. I got me a good one ladies!	9
1	It's totally fair to be done with him. But I dunno I kinda feel like girl code suggests you should go out of your way to let her know that guy is a slimebag. Not to push it, but just make sure she knows. Message her the convo w/ another account, and write something like "You do what you want with that, I'm out".	9
1	i've had a fingernail scratch my vag once. had to stop all intercourse for a week or so, to let it heal. at first i thought it was fine, try to have sex, and it'd open up the cut and i'd be gushing blood all over again.	9
1	Ah ok, if it happens again though you should see a Doc if your SO has clipped his nails and you're still getting tearing. Don't want you to have something worse! &lt;3	9
1	If it helps, what worked for me was gradually changing what I ate, instead of just trying to cut down on calories and change everything I was eating at the same time.  Like instead of potato chips, I'd eat frozen grapes.  Or instead of a bottle of soda, I'd make a strawberry banana smoothie in the blender.  And if I knew I was going to be super exhausted after work and try to pick up takeout, that morning I'd throw some chicken breasts with cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup in a crockpot.  Delicious food was there for me at home, and I lost a lot of fat!	9
1	I'm glad the "slept with his friend after sleeping with him" has a happy conclusion.  And an opportunity for  a part 3.	9
1	Put in charge?  Is that something people do on purpose?  "You, make sure I don't have any fun."	9
1	ehh facebook is starting to crack down on fake accounts and I really don't feel like caring anymore, I tried.	9
1	Here's a clever trick: the way to know whether someone wants to see a dick pic is if they tell you they want to see a dick pic.  The people complaining about them are the people who didn't want to see it but got sent one anyway.  The people who asked for one and got it don't complain.	9
1	"I enjoy spending time with you a lot and wanted to know how you feel about us becoming exclusive".  It's really not as painful as you're psyching yourself up about, I promise.  You can bite the bullet and do this, you're strong, you got this.	9
1	Oh. My.  Word.	9
1	Maybe they wanted to just have girl time? Or maybe she was on "filter" duty, blocking just since of them.	9
1	Yeah, "You Belong With Me" is a terrible song. But I kind of love her more recent stuff, and I think she's just a great public figure all around, and a good role model. I love that she totally plays against the media's portrayal of her now, in both "Blank Space" and "Shake It Off." Which are catchy as fuck and have great music videos.	9
1	Exactly. I only orgasm with oral and toys (look^at^my^flair,^look^at^it! ), and my SO's penis isn't big as well. However, I still treasure and revere his manhood and his body, and can't see myself lusting for anyone else or wishing for him to be different. And I *know* he feels the same about me: this is what love is all about.  Moreover, I'm always looking forward to sex, as it is a passionate, loving experience with him and I don't see myself abdicating it.	9
1	&gt; I also have a sneaking suspicion that I'm bipolar/manic depressive, but I'm not allowed to see a therapist so I don't know.  Um, this is more horrifying than anything. Why are you not "allowed" to see a therapist? Maybe because the therapist would point out your mother's completely irrational expectations and abusive-like* behavior?  *As an internet stranger I don't want to call your mother abusive. But, based on the outside perspective of this internet stranger... she is.	9
1	Huh, they skipped over 2000s...	9
1	All three of us actually talked about the possibility of everyone hooking up, so there is no weirdness. I think the weirdest part is the family part. If our family found out my cousin and I would kill us even though there is no blood relation.	9
1	I helped them get out of unwanted situations. If they wanted it, they got it, if they didn't I swooped in to save them.	9
1	My guess is 2 or 3 drinks in (not more than that, I think), "casually" mention that you've always wondered what it would be like to be with 2 dudes at once, then see where it goes. Granted, I have no experience with threesomes, and I personally have never seen the appeal. Regardless, good luck on that, dude.	9
1	We started talking after her dog ran up to us. She dropped the whole swinger thing on us after 4 or 5 minutes of talking. That's pretty weird, right? I think informing people of your swinger lifestyle should come after a week or so of being friends.	9
1	This is the best analogy I have ever heard again.	9
1	You are a true wingwoman; a Blue Angel mixed with a stealth bomber!	9
1	It was not worth noting, it's like the 1990's spilled over.	9
1	I'm an athlete and I have chub rub. Damn you muscular thighs and booty.	9
1	I know it's terribly cliche, but just be yourself. Wear something that makes you feel comfortable, and just try to act as natural as possible.	9
1	Who did you send it to?	9
1	The idea of swinging sounds arousing, but I know I would hate it if I actually did it. Seeing my BF with another woman would kill me inside.	9
1	so basically...(the kind of) men (who read articles like this) won't marry me...because they are a bunch of whiny dicklizards who want an unpaid domestic servant/sexbot rather than a human partner and aren't willing to lift one single finger to get to know me as a person rather than assigning me a bunch of inaccurate stereotypical negative traits?	9
1	Ugh barf. Baaaarrrf. I should show this to my boyfriend so he can barf too. Someone should show that lady the actual stats that more women just don't want to get married, since we don't need no man to keep us barefoot and pregnant. (lol)  Or the whole idea that you don't need a piece of paper to be a family. (Still convincing my family on that one. My grandma literally said "Well why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free!" Didn't realize I'm a cow.)  Barf! Thanks for the laugh, though!	9
1	It might help to concoct a wild tale of why he disappeared. Turns out he was involved with illegal arms dealing, during an FBI raid he pulled a gun and was shot in the dick. Feel free to add to it.	9
1	Yes, but no one should be held to the shit they did in the past for all time. I think the feminism thing is because her last video (and by last video I mean last one I saw because I have no clue what's cool right now) she kind of played with the media image of her being boy crazy and also just crazy and I think she might have said some things recently that would indicate she's cool with feminism.   I could be talking out of my ass however!	9
1	We broke up because we were enabling each other into bad behavior (excessive drinking, smoking, etc) and couldn't seem to support each other in "growing up." We weren't moving towards any of the goals we had talked about (like marriage) and so we decided to end it so we could be better people. He's a wonderful (though very unmotivated) guy, and I invested so much time and so many resources into our relationship that I expected to be more devastated.	9
1	I could do a threesome as a once off with my SO if we found someone we both thought was really hot or a celebrity crush (I can dream), but yeah, I couldn't get into swinging either. I don't want anyone else boinking or cuddling my man! RAWR!	9
1	Full quote :)  &gt;“Wake up every morning and tell yourself that you’re a badass bitch from hell and that no one can fuck with you and then don’t let anybody fuck with you.” - Kate Nash	9
1	She doesn't want a therapist to point out she's part of the problem. :/	9
1	I'm sorry I'm not trying be be anti-american here, but how the fuck could anyone possibly think this is a sustainable system? How can anyone defend a system like this? I don't care if it's exceptional the fact that it could happen is horrible. By no stretch of the imagination am I saying that Canadian (etc) health care is perfect but I have no idea how the majority of the population copes with the possibility of paying down $1500.	9
1	Thank you, I needed that	9
1	UPDATE: I have written [2.5 sentences](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/penis-fireworks.gif)	9
1	Body shame is NEVER okay, and that's just a mean thing to do. We are so here for you, and I think /r/TrollYChromosome might be a really great place of support too! *hugs*	9
1	Relevant username is relevant.	9
1	Merci! [T'es trop généreuse!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/rdj_thanks.gif)	9
1	You did the right thing!	9
1	Nobody said "girls will be girls" about her... and her case is just one out of all the cases in the world. Regardless of what the woman did, I don't think one instance of a female not being held accountable is a good comparison here.	9
1	Your title glosses over a lot of relevant details.	9
1	&gt; all I can smell is iron  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.   Glad he's a funny guy who's down to give it a shot :P	9
1	Mutual conversation. He asked for a pic, so I asked for one in return.	9
1	I promise I'm actually fun at parties.	9
1	For some reason my phone was messing up and wouldn't let me post a long title. Also, I didn't expect people to see it. I kinda just wanted to tell someone. Haha.	9
1	It's not really about showing respect, it's about being correct	9
1	Why didn't you just say that in the first place?	9
1	Is:  He wants to be financially stable so that if one of us loses a job, or goes on maternity leave, we aren't screwed;  On that list?  Because that's why he doesn't want to get married.	9
1	I once wrote a mildly racy text promising my SO that next time we saw each other I would wear a pair of vintage boots that drive him crazy. Yeah, I accidentally sent it to my best friend, with a photo. The next time I saw her in person and apologized AGAIN, mortified, she brushed it off and told me that it was much less disturbing than the time she got a text from her parent about the graphic things that Parent wanted to do to Stepparent in the backseat of their car.  She then pointed out that I was, as promised, wearing the vintage boots I accidentally texted her about.	9
1	Have you tried looking into [r/howdoibeauty?](http://www.reddit.com/r/howdoibeauty/) Helped me out, at least! :)	9
1	&gt; I only ride the crimson tide when I choose to  Now all I can picture is a surfer. I'm not sure what to think of this.	9
1	So sorry for your loss. *hug*	9
1	Oh honey, I do that all the time! Try to be discreet when my roommates are home though..	9
1	Op clearly has her own shit to worry about.  I'm all for looking out for one another and telling people, but sometimes you have to put your own self preservation over another's wellbeing.  I'm not saying it's not a shitty thing to do, but it's the kind you decide to live with.  Sometimes it's just not worth it.	9
1	Why buy the pig when all you get is a little sausage? :&lt;	9
1	I had to pay an Urgent Care clinic $300 for them to take me back, take my vitals and call 911. Which resulted in a $1300 ambulance bill plus $7,500 at the ER after the trip.  Fuck this fucking shit. Oh and why was I there? I'm allergic to fucking caffeine. Fuck you health system. Fuck you body.	9
1	I DON'T LIKE BEYONCE EITHER	9
1	/r/TrollMUA is always helpful too in addition to what the other commenters are posting. I also like /r/drugstoreMUA - they have a super handy list in their sidebar of cheap makeup that works well. I say try to tackle one category on their list at a time (mascara, blush, etc.) and take it slowly. It's seriously all just practice.	9
1	No nonsense starter tutorials, start from the bottom and work your way up: http://www.lisaeldridge.com/video/basics/	9
1	In my experience that's a waste of time, nobody checks their "Other" inbox.	9
1	I. DON'T. KNOW.  Even worse, I found it at a thrift store so I couldn't buy twelve of them and I couldn't tell you where to get one.	9
1	You think a hippie would be in ***support*** of better living through chemistry.	9
1	Holy shit, *Forgetting Sarah Marshall* is one of my favourite home-alone-drunk-night-in movies and can quote it almost word for word, but this is the first time I've noticed that Cynthia Nixon [actually walks past Jason Segal in this scene!!!](http://d3819ii77zvwic.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ik49VlPshlPIz.gif)	9
1	Hippie dude sounds like he could do with more than a few gut punches so he can skip the Advil and embrace his masculinity.	9
1	Not female so I'm kinda confused.  Do you know cock block even it's just a girls night and you're staying together or is it to get rid of the pushy, creepy, unwanted guys?	9
1	IKR?! How much hairspray goes on in just one of those videos?	9
1	It's always the thrift stores!  But seriously, these see-through shirts are making online shopping difficult. Two many times I've gone "the model isn't wearing anything underneath, must be fine" and I get colorful tissue paper in the mail. Curse you, photoshop!	9
1	Get rid of creepy unwanted guys. Wanted guys were fine.	9
1	Other quotes: "Make sure to thank your friends because they're trying really hard to find your phone right now and also because they're just awesome in general."  "Stop fucking tickling me, (friend)."  "Don't shine a flashlight in his eyes, (other friend). Oh my god, Amdir, all your friends are children."  "Make sure you drink water because you definitely didn't tonight."	9
1	You got teenagers to approve of you?? Without buying them beer?  I'm impressed.	9
1	Agreed, it's possible that he made some nasty shit up about OP to prevent them from talking.   But, even if she knows the whole story, she may not want to talk to OP. Situations like that are just awkward and difficult at best, it's understandable that she might want to avoid conversation.	9
1	"Thanks for your unsolicited opinion about my bodily functions, stranger!"  Seriously though, my uterus is nobody's business but my own, and nobody but my doctor gets to tell me how I should or should not manage my period.	9
1	I'm pretty sure women in the past, before stuff like Midol/general pain relievers, were like "god damn it, I wish there was a pill or something for this shit".	9
1	Nobody should have to "embrace" what feels like a tiny army trying to scrape their way out of my abdomen with sharpened rocks.	9
1	Well, at least she's got a good excuse to always be allowed to ride shotgun in that car from now on instead of having to get in the back seat.	9

1	OH my god! That is SO much worse that I expected.... what the fuck? http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2013/10/DF2DFhS.gif  (I can't be bothered to learn how to hyperlink right now)	9
1	That is amazing and rare! That's like finding an albino deer or something!	9
1	Thank you! I just broke my foot, am on crutches, had to work a full event for my job, and am supposed to fly next week.... Your encouragement means a lot, internet stranger!	9
1	It's not her responsibility,  it's the cheating scums.	9
1	"Unnatural chemicals"? Like the dank he was obviously vaping earlier that day? What a dumbass..	9
1	&gt;By Suzanne Venker  I think that's probably the saddest part of the article.	9
1	Sometimes I really wish it were possible to make people without uteruses experience cramps *just once*.	9
1	This gif is amazing. I hope you had fun!!	9
1	Right? If I'm fighting through a workday with cramps, I just keep telling myself that at least I'm not a pilgrim woman having to churn butter or run a farm or some shit.	9
1	I don't know, you seem to be adulting pretty well.	9
1	Grab him by the balls and squeeeeeeeeze and then tell him he needs to "embrace the entire experience" of being a male with external genetalia.	9
1	If my husband cheated on me and I didn't find out just because ”ehh,” the other girl didn't ”feel like it”... I can't tell you how much more pain that would cause me. It would be incredibly easy to do, and it could save another wronged woman that much more heartache.	9
1	I wish I could say it got better, but it's different for everyone... I'm sending internet hugs to you right now. I'm really sorry for your loss ):	9
1	&gt; I'm sorry I'm not trying be be anti-american here  Jesus I hate that that's a sentiment in this country. I'm not from here so I don't care if I am "anti-american," but how utterly despicable that some people have managed to turn any criticism of the US into treason-lite.  Healthcare in the US is horrifying to anyone who has lived in any other first-world country and has any kind of budget to worry about. Demanding improvement is not anti-US.  (Anyway imho nationalism is dumb, but that's just me)	9
1	That's so awesome--most of the blouses I find these days are made out of tissue paper.  Half-transparent and either unravel at the seams or tear/snag after a few months.	9
1	...I don't like that relationship. :/	9
1	Not only does it destroy jeans, but forget wearing a dress on a hot day because by the end of the day with all that walking and sweating, my thighs are chapped and painful D:	9
1	I'm not usually an advocate for violence, but "Talk shit, get hit" sounds like an appropriate response, here.	9
1	Totally agree, both that nationalism is stupid (where you were born is kinda an accident) and that criticism is now seen as treason-lite by many. But I'm not american, so as an outsider criticizing from outside the system I wanted to make sure people knew I wasn't criticizing for the sake of criticising.  Also because being polite seems to be the one Canadian stereotype that holds some weight (though we do have assholes here like everywhere).	9
1	[how?????????](http://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Youth-GIF-1420665572.gif)	9
1	My understanding of that is that there are approximately 200 unsolicited dick pics sent for every one that someone actually wants.	9
1	I knew a lady with that attitude... even though her cramps would leave her curled up in a ball of misery for a day or two.    There's nothing "powerful" or "liberating" about being stricken completely useless by pain.  No, the liberation is taking advantage of modern science and going "fuck you, you bizarre, disgusting, wasteful reproductive biology!"	9
1	I wear bike shorts under my skirts or loose fitting pants. They  work miracles!	9
1	I don't wear a bra and it is *so fucking hard* to find shirts that aren't so thin that my nipples easily show through (the actual color/outline of my nipples, not just being cold). Ugh. I bought some nipple covers thinking that would solve the problem, but it actually just makes it worse. That was such a let-down. I've kind of given up at this point, I just wear whatever now. It's still an amazing feeling to find that perfect shirt that doesn't expose everything and won't fall apart immediately though!	9
1	Their reference points are sitcoms, stand up comics, and cherry picked anecdotes of affirmation; you can't expect them to actually, you know, interact with women or listen to them in the real world. That's just car-azy!	9
1	Wow, yeah, I needed to hear that after what I just posted about a few hours ago, haha. And I'm trying so hard to feel this way... I'm definitely making this a motto.	9
1	Please you can't expect the keyboard warriors on reddit keeping the good name of the man intact to actually interact with a scary woman.	9
1	Holy shit, scientists actually managed to make a working time machine, because this article and author clearly came from several decades ago.	9
1	I drunk texted my brother a few weeks ago, where I declared the f word fucking awesome.	9
1	Don't google her. It gets worse. She's apparently also gone on Fox news to argue that women should be financially dependent on men... seriously.	9
1	My condolences. You doing ok? Wanna chat about it?	9
1	Ugh, once my dad was like, "How bad can it be?  Quit complaining".    NO.	9
1	Yeah there's a difference between rambunctious and just plain mean.	9
1	I love your comment and so does my mom. Have an upvote.	9
1	This is MADNESS!!!	9
1	[Original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmCLLTjI6dw) for those interested.	9
1	Oh God I'm so sorry.	9
1	I ALMOST SENT A WAY TOO IN DEPTH POOP TEXT TO SOMEONE WHO WASN'T MY BEST FRIEND YESTERDAY. I had typed it out and everything. Phew that god. It wasn't sexual though	9
1	I just want more xannax	9
1	I also probably said some shitty stuff about girls that were more popular/prettier than I was in high school. A lot of those songs she sang when she was a teen. It's hard for me to keep it against her.   Also: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeVsQW-eaaY	9
1	this is a lie, these do not exist!	9
1	Lol how did she respond? I'd have been like "I gotta talk it over with my SO but maybe I could do one quick "Go get em" butt slap, what do you think?"	9
1	Omg. This is so bad and wrong. Did you guys know that the whole stat about marriage becoming less common in America is actually much more complicated than it seems? Marriage rates are actually pretty darn steady among the elite and college educated. They are falling off dramatically for the poor and disadvantaged. So yeah, its less about changing culture and more about the sharp divide between the lower and upper class :/ I can get some citations if anyone's curious, just ask!	9
1	I mean it comes from the ground, but honestly so do most medicines they're just refined or recreated in a lab. Sooooooooooooooo "yeah bro I was crying on my living room floor earlier. This is natural enough for me fucker."	9
1	I just don't understand this. Men don't want to be "tied down" financially in a marriage but when they're anti-feminist they're supporting the notion that women shouldn't work and be independent?	9
1	Here is a version of the link that wont give fox any page views: http://www.donotlink.com/ez3a	9
1	You would think the super-straight hair trend would've been noteworthy.	9
1	Haha amazing. She said that her "kids" got ahold of her phone and were trying to be funny. Right.......	9
1	Unless people use birth control and other methods and protect their bodies.	9
1	I don't see how period pains are any more an essential part of someone's femininity than getting kicked in the ball pain is an essential part of someone's masculinity.  That being said, he seems pretty confident so it's probably best to just kick him in the balls.   "Shhhhhh........embrace it."	9
1	Mhmmm.gif   Funny "kids", very creative and specific bunch. :p	9
1	Talk shit, get hit, EMBRACE IT!!!	9
1	Dude, yes. Or you get a bitchin hand cramp	9
1	Awww; may it rain dildos and vibrators with little parachutes over your dwelling. &lt;3	9
1	Or kind of soggy. My hand gets soggy. :/	9
1	This is why I wish trollx was a social network and not a subreddit because I really want to camp out with pizza and wine with you until it's all better.	9
1	I'm so sorry. I'm sending hugs	9
1	The whole thing is counterintuitive. The men won't be tied down financially if the women can support themselves.   If people who think like this don't want to marry, I say awesome.	9
1	&gt;Two many times  Just two huh? :P	9
1	"Suzanne Venker has written extensively about marriage and the family and its intersection with the culture. She is also the founder of Women for Men (WFM), a news and opinion website **committed to improving gender relations and to providing much-needed support for the American male.**"  WAT?!   So lets bash women to bring up the repressed American male. -_-	9
1	Yep. Former competitive gymnast here. Sometimes, no matter how in shape you are, you're just going to have to live with overly friendly thighs. I recommend bandalettes.	9
1	Oh I got so sad when I clicked and saw this was written by a woman...	9
1	There was a time when men were men and women were property, dammit!	9
1	NO ONE UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS	9
1	No but see if women are DEPENDENT on them financially, then the men aren't tied down, bc the women have to do whatever the men want in order to be housed/fed.	9
1	should have punched him in the guts to give him a glimpse of reality	9
1	I mean, that should be her reaction, but it's still wonderful and great that she took up for you and cares. I'm so sorry you went through that, but, I'm so happy you have at least one close person to lean on and talk to about it. *Hugs* &lt;3	9
1	Wtf would he know about it? Shut up. No uterus, no opinion.	9
1	fuck that bitch. conservative nutjob jealous of other women not bound to the same rules as she. fuck her.	9
1	That chick was born gorgeous.	9
1	Not a uterus owner, but I think the cramps and stuff y'all deal with are similar to getting kicked in the balls, so his argument is irrelevant.	9
1	I'm not sure of their exact reasons, but it could be to avoid the group of people who inevitably feel the need to say things like, 'awww, you look better WITHOUT all that' or 'What a waste of money!'   &amp;nbsp;  Sometimes it's nice to have a community of just like-minded people =)	9
1	Unfortunately a lot of people don't believe their kids when they say something like that happened to them. If it had been my father's side, they would have yelled at me and I don't doubt I would have been slapped for accusing such a "great man" of something so awful. (That side has a ton of other issues, but this is just an example)  I'd always known my mom to be very close to her parents and although they had their faults like anyone else, it was one reaction that I couldn't predict.   Thanks for your support. *hugs*	9
1	Embrace the longstanding human tradition of saying "fuck nature" and doing it your own way.	9
1	She's doing it soooo right. I didn't have that support. Glad you two are handling it as well as possible.	9
1	I'm sure she has an entire team to make her look good though. Whose individual salaries are each probably more than I make in a year. You'd look Amazeballs too with that kinda intimate attention, and probably the best spanx in the entire world.	9
1	[Because it's not like women are individuals who shouldn't be generalized /s](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bQ4waDPuor0/UIdwWXmIpMI/AAAAAAAAEr8/Gv81Ax9NnRY/s1600/tumblr_m9mu4wSWwB1qk6p06o1_400.png)	9
1	Oh yeah, I know boys and girls that were straight up abandoned/kicked out for coming forward and saying a relative or friend of the family molested them; it breaks my heart. My brain scarcely comprehends me or my parents ever being that way, it's just a level of cruelty beyond reckoning.	9
1	It's really upsetting how many people this happens to. I'm sorry you experienced something like that. *hugs*	9
1	*"And men are more likely than women to have never made it down the aisle (23% vs. 17% in 2012)."*  By the sounds of that, men are actually the ones that people are refusing to marry.	9
1	I love imagining that every woman looked just like that. Like, going to a super ritzy ball? Straw hat and a gun!	9
1	It's unfortunate kids are punished for doing the right thing just because the parents are in shock. There's a lot of things in life that people just won't be able to understand unless they experience them first hand. For a lot of people, emotions take over and they act on instinct instead of thinking about the fact that this is their child.	9
1	&gt; motherfucker, it feels like a wolverine is going to town on my ute,   Your my new favorite person.	9
1	That's a thing?! Well, [something else to worry about at night.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/scurred.gif)	9
1	If men bleed from their penis once a month they would need to be put in a medically induced coma to survive. I don't think they could psychologically handle it.   Deal with your period in whatever way works for you. Everyone else, and their unsolicited judgement, can fuck right off.	9
1	My mom was born in the 1950s and I remembered her telling me how much she suffered before the first pain reliever for cramps came out (1970s?). She would have to stay home from school and vomit all day. I would vomit from cramps as a teen even after taking advil, so I couldn't imagine life before advil/midol.	9
1	[Amen.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcbtwnPBIl1qfqlpv.gif)	9
1	Urgh, the pains of typing fast! Graduating from college next week, and apparently can't use the right "too". :P	9
1	I have an aunt named Ute (german) and she's a real cunt. This amused me way more than it probably should. Thank you lol.	9
1	Dicklizards haha. I'm a child and I shall not apologize.	9
1	The thing with exes is that as soon as we break off with them often times we try and nail them down to one thing. Almost objectify them. Only remember one thing or the last things that happened before we broke up, when the thing that drew them to us is the complexity and how open we could be with them. We saw the humanity in them better than anyone else, and to get reminded of that can be a strange wake up call.  To quote Silent Bob, a little out of context but I think it works just enough to use, "She was a girl, I know that now."	9
1	"Sensual velociraptor noises"  I think I missed that part in the Jurassic World trailers; were they making them at Chris Pratt? :p	9
1	God that makes me want to chuck a dirty tampon at him.	9
1	An app that tells you where in the world it is 5 o'clock and gives you a translation of how to order a popular drink from that country.	9
1	Honest question so don't hurt me. How's the term sexist?	9

1	I haven't ovulated in a decade, but I feel this way about my cat all the time.	9
1	I'm very glad that your mother is doing her job as a parent, and wholeheartedly supporting you while thinking about your future. Would that we all had mothers like yours...	9
1	Teh poor menz! They need all the help they can get, really. Hot womenz get all the breaks.	9
1	Thanks for your support.	9
1	She is radiant. Bitch.	9
1	Ooh, same story about my aunt, the only one of three sisters who got bad cramps.  She stayed home from school and had this large workbook of different, like, ballet and yoga stretches she had to do that were supposed to help (only a little) with the pain.  EDIT: and then there was my grandmother and great-grandmother.... in those generations, doctors didn't even believe menstrual cramps *existed*!!!!1!!  You know, because (1) how could they? and (2) you know how women like to complain X(	9
1	An eggplant could be overkill. You don't want him to feel inadequate. It's better to use a zucchini.  Also, make sure to wait in his home before he gets in to surprise him (this only works if you sweep up the glass from the broken window before he sees)!	9
1	So sorry for your loss. Xo	9
1	Maybe, but the burden is still not on OP. Doing it causes her to still be dealing with this instead of moving on. Would it be good? Yeah, but its not her problem.	9
1	Give him a tampon sandwich a la Red in OITNB.	9
1	I'm so sorry.	9
1	"Oh look, another man telling me what to do with my body. I hope you go to bed knowing you're no better than those men on Capitol Hill that you probably despise. Have a good night!"	9
1	I'm so sorry, doll.	9
1	The only Ute I've even known was a massive cunt too!	9
1	Drunk you should be a life coach.	9
1	times like these you need an electric cattle prod for....simulation purposes   EMBRACE YOUR FRAGILE, VULNERABLE DANGLY MAN BITS, FOOL.	9
1	Women are individuals? *PUHA!* Next you'll tell me they have the right to vote!	9
1	For the record, 5 isn't tiny... It's quite average. When you said "tiny" I was imagining a 3 inch micropenis.  Like okay, you don't have a monster cock or anything, but if your gf thought your dick was worth laughing at, she's in for a lot of disappointments in her life. Most dicks are around that size. Also, she might be confused because she sounds like a HUGE dick.	9
1	I can't stop laughing.  Of course it was a dude.	9
1	Does she not get periods?  Why the heck would she do this to you! :(	9
1	[Dude, for both of you. Seriously, one of the lyrics is "I feel like a werewolf is livin' in my uterus." NSFW] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDDHfmC-AgE)	9
1	"Merde" means shit in french	9
1	Why are you even friends on facebook? That is so awkward!!	9
1	Should have punched him and told to embrace his masculinity.	9
1	Obviously she doesn't get bad ones.	9

1	That is the best use of this gif ever. Good job running defense!	9
1	:( love you trollsister. Im sorry sweetie. *hugs*	9
1	The light touch of miss Tina Belcher, so subtle.	9
1	Pretty much describes my subtlety level.	9
1	Oh my god. This reminds me of the other day when I was looking at pasta in the grocery store and this completely overweight guy came up to me and said "That's all fattening you know." Fuck. You.	9
1	...I'm going to guess she meant it was derogatory, not sexist.	9
1	he's right, don't take midol.   take robaxacet platinum. Muscle relaxants + ibuprofen = the most comfortable period you've ever had (aside from the bloating and the pooping)	9
1	This reaction gif is so cute!  Glad you were so excited. I actually prefer the opposite style on a man. Clean face, long hair.	9
1	I used to love clean shaved men but then I met the husband.. :B	9
1	I totally lost it at the end: "My approach *is* subtle."	9
1	Tell your mom I say hi.	9
1	Eggplant is overkill?   [I guess I should change...](http://i1207.photobucket.com/albums/bb480/Yumekichi11/pictures%202/62c1fa15.jpg)	9
1	I thought it was common knowledge that vaginas suck the masculinity right out of every man they lock on to? /facetious rant	9
1	There *is* hope for us men with full beards! *Sobs with glee.* Thank jeebus!	9
1	Weed might be natural but the pesticide I guarantee was used to protect the crop is certainly not.	9
1	There are dozens of us! DOZENS!	9
1	Dude needs reminding that not every woman has a uterus and defining femininity by biological shit ain't cool	9
1	Yep, I get the wrinkly fingers and the hand cramps too.	9
1	Dude, I'm sure you intended that to be a helpful comment but it really comes across as kicking the OP while she's down. It's totally not cool to call anyone "damaged".	9
1	Damn. If I were in her position I'd be terrified that it would be uploaded to ...the internet... ^*ahem*^OP  Hey, Christina. U mad girl?	9
1	For what? Them having the ability to text strangers with someone else's phone?	9
1	We can vote now!?	9
1	[How you doin](http://i.imgur.com/1NIR9lk.gif)	9
1	Urgh. My DEALER told me that smoking MMJ to help with dysmenorrhea was unnatural and it would inhibit the flow of my cycle and cause more pain in the long run. Dude, Get stuffed, Pain relief is designed for temporary pain that inhibits daily life activities, like period pain. Be that Midol or Marjuana, It's all chemicals, It's all unnatural to put in your body, But you can fuck yourself with a flaming cactus if you think it's unnecessary. (Side note: getting fucked by a flaming cactus while suffering gastroenteritis is how I describe period pain)	9
1	&gt; trying to decide if it's worth the extra three bucks for name brand over generic (usually isn't but I don't fuck around with cramps and always end up with name brand anyway)  Off topic I know, but the name brand and generic are identical. The extra 3 bucks is just for the name. Any difference you notice it just psychological.	9
1	It throws me for a loop, too. My fiance is Canadian so he mentions it occasionally, and I'm just like... what, do you guys not have Craigslist up north? Come on. :P	9
1	Yep! And you can spend that extra $3 on delicious ice cream...	9
1	&gt; my mom's step-dad married a lady who adopted her grandson.   ...For the life of me I can not figure out what that relation is. And I read V.C. Andrews.  I'm about to draw up a family tree here.	9
1	I thought it was called beaver damming?	9
1	That comment would only get you upvoted in the default subs, not here &gt;:|	9
1	Oh god, I used to be one of those. (Not the embrace femininity, but the no "unnatural chemicals"). One day I was in some serious pain my father made me take a pill. Now, my period is due? Pop one a few hours before the pain kicks in. Thanks, dad, for opening my eyes to not having to go through unnecessary pain.	9
1	That tampon looked so realistic I almost gagged.	9
1	It sure is natural! That's why they think it's good, because natural is ALWAYS good.  Know what else is natural? ***Bears***.   Natural =/= Good for you.	9
1	I swear, even the thickest of light coloured shirts require you to wear either an undershirt over a bra, or a skin coloured bra. Both of which I have very few of.	9
1	My brother was like, "That's such an unrealistic looking mouse." And I just laughed at him and told him that it wasn't a mouse. Not even close.	9
1	DAMMIT! We need the info! What's on the tags?! What's the style number?!	9
1	Once you go beard you never go back	9
1	Who needs CL when we have Kijiji!	9
1	Don't mind Jerry, he pops out of the aisles every once in a while. He was just trying to save you from his fate, he's not very good with people.	9
1	"or at least work really, really hard to wear her down."  What is this? WWII?	9
1	The ACTUAL reason less people are getting married in the UK is that young couples just can't afford it.	9
1	It's sort of like the horrible pain you get about a half hour before you get horrible diarrhea. But it's not diarrhea and it lasts for a week	9
1	Some people refuse to understand that humans are a part of nature too... There is no "detachment" from nature. We are cut from the same cloth as all other living things and have made our environments suit our needs. Taking human medicine is a natural remedy. Synthetic things are natural. Being a douchebag about people taking NSAIDs is arrogant, smug, and ignorant.	9
1	You know, it's these kinds of things that make me like women way more than men. Way to go, sexists!	9
1	I would have laughed in his face. Humankind's best asset is to make tools to make our life easier. Painkillers are just another tool. And you know damn well I'll be using it when I need it. Go humans. Not using the tools we make is like denying our very human nature. I embrace it!	9
1	Just prepare thyself for double penetration, girl.	9
1	So like getting stabbed in the stomach along with pressure for a week? Fuuuuuuuuuck that noise. I am so sorry. That dude needed a good punch in the gut, then.	9
1	&gt; "Well why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free!"   To keep the grass short. To breed it to get more cows. To kill it and devour its flesh. There are loads of reasons to get a cow other than milk.	9
1	I think she was just one of those lucky women that got really mild periods, and she just couldn't imagine it being that bad. I remember her always telling me "I get periods too, and you don't see me laying around" I think she just really lacks empathy (towards me at least).	9
1	You said that really well, I'll probably steal it. I agree 100%. I always laugh when people talk about "unnatural chemicals", like wtf is an unnatural chemical? Everything comes from something, they just only extract the parts they need and mix it with other things to get the desired results.  I don't know if that made sense.. I'm so tired I can't words.	9
1	Hmm. Close. Pressure isn't exactly right. It's a literal muscle cramp in the area where poop pain happens. And mine hurts inside my vagina like an achey stretchy feeling too. Thank you for being a cool not uterus owner and probably a cool person in general :)	9
1	[Here's a DoNotLink URL](http://www.donotlink.com/ez3a) for anyone who wants to read it but not give Fox News the views :)	9
1	A friend. It was intended for my best friend. They haven't replied yet. 😳	9
1	We're agreeing. I'm just doing it in a funny way.	9
1	No it makes perfect sense. Determining that man-made things are natural let's you accept the fact that its a sliding scale. We get breast implants and wear makeup but other animals puff up their chests, change colours, wear bird feathers, and put colourful things together to attract others. Whats the real difference between us and them besides complex speech? All living things are trying to change the world in their favour.   Also this is why I fucking hate people who think a good diet involves not eating chemicals you can't pronounce.... (do you know what isobutyl acetate is? It's what makes raspberries smell like raspberries)	9
1	We actually do have CL. Nobody uses it.	9
1	&gt; about how femininity is a gift and I shouldn't be using unnatural chemicals to keep myself from experiencing it wholly and "goddess glory"  No uterus, no opinion! Wtf? I bet he uses a crystal as deodorant.	9
1	&gt;"That's such an unrealistic looking mouse."  *Aww*. Bless his heart.	9
1	... Or some chocolate.  Oeh, oeh, or some *chocolate ice cream*...	9
1	Oh I saw that thread, the whole thing was fairly messy and terrible. It was about a guy who started paying less attention to a girl and then she asked him out. Loads of guys didn't seem to understand that what happened was probably A. She liked him but was shy and when he backed off she thought she was losing her chance so she went for it, or B. she liked him but found him clingy and then he chilled out and she became interested romantically. I swear these pick up artist types/sociopaths seem to think they're amazing manipulators when they finally develop the very basic social skills that most people develop in their early teens.	9
1	They're also all made of some weird elastic fabric. I just want an opaque white cotton shirt with buttons which go up to the neck (I'm wearing them as a medical student so I need to be able to bend down over a patient without flashing them)! Is that so much to ask??	9
1	Just gotta be completely honest imo. Communication is key for anything, especially situations like this. Good luck.	9
1	Youre really missing out on all the men who would just get married for the sex. Poor you.  /ssssssss	9
1	That's what I love about articles like this. Like I'm going to mourn the opportunity to marry these shitheads.	9
1	It was an invitation dear.	9
1	You have an amazing mother. Im so sorry that you had to go through that. But at least for RIGHT NOW, you have your mother. And I'm happy that you can lean on her if you need too. Hugs.	9
1	Well, consider [the direct approach](http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/kwweekendupdate.gif).	9
1	I wanted to find a gif of Pam Poovey when she says "masturbate till my fingers bleed". But I couldn't. OP I have failed you :(	9
1	Are you /u/pandasarus's uncle by any chance?	9
1	[Your wish is my command](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtR_-MINR1o)  On a side note, part of my job is playing with these machines, but we set them up differently to reduce pain not cause pain.	9
1	This happened to me in a service station. I was buying a meal and it came with a fizzy drink so I was mixing coke and fanta (Cheap verion of a German drink 'Mezzo mix') and suddenly this huge man beside me starts lecturing me about diabetes.          I wasn't even having a big cup, I just missed Germany damnit!     The thing was he *would not stop*. He kept talking about it, and how I should be careful, all whilst helping himself to a can of relentless. :/ Still don't understand what happened that day.	9
1	I am so sorry!! Your mom is beastly though!! Please go see a doctor at least a couple of times. It may be affecting you in ways you don't know.	9
1	Huh. That explains why German pattern company Burdastyle has a blouse pattern called 'Ute' - it is a female name. Being from Australian, where a ute is a car, it left me a bit confused. Thank you - you have solved a long standing mystery for me!	9
1	Yachting for a swatting?	9
1	It's so ridiculous when people won't use chemical compound X because it was created in a laboratory, even if it is the *exact same* compound found in nature.	9
1	Ugh, I used to be a total wank about "natural living" too. I wasn't opposed to medicines, but thought a healthy diet could heal anyone and that I shouldn't be putting "chemicals" on my skin. God I was a douche.	9
1	Nor the fertilizer(s).	9
1	As someone with endometriosis who cannot live without painkillers every day, I am so sorry you had to go through that. The pain is often bad with the drugs, I couldn't imagine without them!	9
1	Whaat?! This is going too far, soon we'll be able to make decisions about our own bodies! We won't survive without men's guidance!	9
1	Haha! When my husband makes smart ass comments I always tell him that I'm going to bleed on him. I haven't actually come up with a plan for how I would, but it usually shuts him up. I may have to settle for flinging a tampon his way.	9
1	My femininity   It has yesterday's lunch coming out both ends  The swords of the Persian army shred my torso  Thank you hippies  I am aware	9
1	The active ingredients are identical. Sometimes, the inactive ingredients are not and may cause unpleasant reactions/side effects. I do much better on brand name hormonal birth control and it's always a shit show when the pharmacy tries to switch me to generic without warning.	9
1	The shirts are photoshopped on the models to look opaque, when in reality they are see-through.	9
1	Omg this happened with me and my ex! I was getting super into fingering her and then the horror...... I went straight to the bathroom before she could see how much blood there was.. I was so freaked out but I didn't want to freak her out so I kind of pretended it wasn't a big deal. But I was having such an enternal OMG WTF SHE IS DYING moment in my head	9
1	Hugs... so many hugs for you, and xanax.	9
1	Arsenic is all natural. Sounds like this guy could use a dose! See how he feels about "natural" stuff then.	9
1	There can be actual differences. I have noticed Advil makes a better coating than most generics. For some people, swallowing pills can be a real chore and this can be helpful.  But besides occasional details like that, I'm all for generics.	9
1	Nah, it's mostly because it's a guy.  I've met those same types and most women go about this but they make a special exception for when they're on their period.  A guy has no frame of reference so of course they'd likely say this shit.	9
1	Oh god, that sounds 100% like what happened! He was going pretty balls to the walls. He said it was all g, but he kept asking if I was okay, so he probably thought I might have been dying too haha.	9
1	They are inferring that the clothes are SO thin they are basically tissue paper :)	9
1	Haha, he was honestly just like "Yeah, this feels good downstairs, but my nose can't handle it".	9
1	The shirt which she ordered online. She likened it to tissue paper, as it is a transparent and fragile fabric.	9
1	Not 100% related, but when guys come to me for advice on how to pick up a girl I tell them to complement her hair or clothes. She tried harder on that (usually). Also, it's a lot easier to not answer that I have a SO when someone tells me my hair is awesome.	9
1	But in some cases it's also diarrhea! I always have the joy of playing the "period or diarrhea" game with my cramps.	9
1	Couldn't you replace 'women' with 'redditors' in that sentence and actually be correct?	9
1	Oh lawdy, this is 100% me. An hour later I'm lying there sweaty, hand cramping like a bitch, fingers looking like I just spent 10hrs in a pool, and eyeing the porn on my laptop with disgust. I really need to get some sort of sex toy, but I'm scared of adult stores o_o	9
1	You should xpost this to /r/niceguys ;)	9
1	I had an older woman tell me once that woman don't get cramps, it's all in their head, and she never got cramps. Completely rage inducing. I lost all respect for her that day.	9
1	you might need to find a new property manager incase this one ends up dieing from embarrassment	9
1	Time to turn them into not fuck buddy?	9
1	You're beautiful. Also I don't know how [this went over my head for so long](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/reverse.gif)	9
1	I'm in limbo.  Currently interviewing new applicants ;)	9
1	This. In her position I can't see why she wouldn't, especially as the British tabloids would absolute savage her if she had so much as a zit. I feel kinda bad for her actually.	9
1	Man if you're in limbo your back must hurt 0.o  Also, you should pass that application out to people, might help your search.	9
1	It can be a secret test to vet out faux trolls. To be one of us you must understand the significance of these findings!  Edit: I feel I may be watching too much 3rd Rock From the Sun...	9
1	Next time I go out I'm taking 10 of these with me 😎 http://imgur.com/y8vwn8B	9
1	We require photographic evidence! ^including_close_up_of_the_tag   Edit: formatting question - does anyone know how to superscript the whole sentence without using the underscore? I either ^end^up^with^this or I ^end up with this :(	9
1	Oh my god I'm embarrassed for her.	9
1	The 'magic' is makeup artists and hair stylists :P	9
1	I'm rather involved with BDSM and my Dom controls my food.  I send him texts like this every day, and it would actually make me pass out with embarrassment!	9
1	My food is one thing I will not compromise on. Hard limit. I'm exercising and dieting for me, not because I'll get punished if I don't.	9
1	Well, it was an EXTRA long winter	9
1	I mean...who else would you make them at?	9
1	And winter is starting here in the southern hemisphere. My little lady just enjoys her fur coat!	9
1	and now I'm picturing a vagina in mink O_o	9
1	Thanks.  I'm considering it but I do think I'm ok. He died when I was 16, so that's 8 years of being around him after it happened. And in that time, I did all the things a granddaughter would normally do except let myself be alone with him.	9
1	The group chat is called #trollxfinest on an app named kik.   Edit: second group is called #trollx2	9
1	Yes... this "logic". I ended up blocking my niece on facebook because of this. She was going on about how she looks down on drug dealers and "haha I've only smoked weed, but that's a natural plant not a drug". I just *had* to tell her that it is, indeed, a drug. Even gave her the literal definition, and she pulled that "it's my opinion and I'm not changing my mind". Rage ensued.	9
1	This pisses me off just because this "you are a Goddess" shit is exactly what some Hindi families pull in India to guilt the girls and women out of going out on their own and pursuing their own interests.  I know this guy meant well, but GAH.	9
1	Yeah, definitely one way to develop an unhealthy relationship with food (for me).	9
1	Only the best for my little lady! :P	9
1	I'm totally the opposite! I found my apartment on CL, my last job, I've sold things and bought things. I've never used Kijiji beyond searching for an apartment.	9
1	This phrase literally sickens me. Do they not understand that EVERYTHING is chemicals?? I work with a lot of people like this, people who go on juice cleanses and engage in crystal therapy and I'm sick of defending myself against their ignorance when I *have* to take my meds for bipolar disorder and chronic migraines. I have to or I will suffer and probably kill myself. So thanks so much for your misplaced advice, flower children!	9
1	pro tip: get some scissors and trim it a bit before you start to shave! makes it faster and less painful after not doing it for a while	9
1	I don't trust myself with scissors near my vaj since The Incident. O_o	9
1	I wonder if these people who think women hate each other are also the type who believe men and women can't be friends (because sex! or something). So do they just think all women have no friends or what???	9
1	Been there. :(	9
1	Ask your dealer how natural crying, shitting, and vomiting on the bathroom floor at the exact same time is. I know I've felt like a total goddess while experiencing that moment.	9
1	Oh I totally agree that it's a drug. Penicillin is made from mold, so that's where I was pulling that nature from. Coke also comes from a plant and caffeine is also a drug.   I love weed, but people can be super dumb sometimes. I also fucking hate when you tell someone a FACT and they start spouting off "well its my opinion". Back your shit up, tell me WHY, otherwise I'll assume you're stupid. (Not you Faydre, I like you)	9
1	Or rather [this](http://i.imgur.com/MlHm0Zg.gif)?	9
1	For basic t-shirts and the like, try men's. It's..  Apparent just how much companies conspire to sell us shitty clothes. Even higher end retail where it's that see through is a fashion choice, but them being cheap and trying to pawn off shitty clothes at top prices.	9
1	Ugh that was me Friday. Should I vomit, Shit myself, or return this email? So many options...	9
1	My mom is going to therapy (I hope) for things that happened to her as a child. She didn't even realize she needed it until I told her over Christmas.   Take your time, but most therapist you'd see are SUPER nice and understanding and you don't have to take any medicine you don't want to. Not that they would suggest medicine, but don't let it stop you.	9
1	Oh man I needed that! Going on a trip and I've eaten way too much/exercised way too little lately so I've gained a few. Today I'm going to put outfits together and am afraid what I want to wear won't fit. I'll think of this when I get deterred by what doesn't fit, find what does, and rock that shit! Thank you Troll!	9
1	It sounds like the tweet is talking about TERFs (Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists), who argue that trans women are not women.	9
1	&gt; so I was mixing coke and fanta (Cheap verion of a German drink 'Mezzo mix')  Oooh, how well did that work? I'm in Germany now, and I'll certainly miss Mezzo Mix when I get back.	9
1	That is definitely a sub/dom text. Hopefully she doesn't die of embarrassment and you have to go apartment hunting over again something trivial.	9
1	This is so beautiful. After such a horrible thing to happen she is being such an amazing mother, and I'm so happy for you that this is how she's acting.  I hope you're gonna be ok!	9
1	Are you kidding? Women are the fucking badassest people I know. I love women!!	9
1	Foxglove, too. AKA digitalis. It is natural enough to stop your fucking heart.	9
1	My family doctor is also a therapist. I'd probably go see her if I were to see someone.	9
1	Little Caesar's is ridiculously awesome. I had that happen once too, and I was super excited except it was at the end of the day so I just had more pizza later that night.   It was beautiful &lt;3	9
1	You know nothing, John Snow	9
1	You mean like a penis-fly trap?	9
1	it's called [Benevolent Sexism](http://www.psypost.org/2015/04/study-anti-abortion-views-linked-to-sexist-attitudes-towards-women-33638) "Really, I care about and respect you, so you should do what I say".	9
1	On a side note: I LOVE PINGU!	9
1	We're not! She keeps trying to add me! This is the 3rd account I've had to block. She's used two different accounts in just the past month. I've never spoken to her, and years ago, through a mutual friend, I found out she accused me of stalking her at her house.	9
1	Thanks. Like I said to someone else,  it's sad that so many kids out there don't get this kind of reaction from their parents and are punished for telling what happened to them. This will probably only ever be between me and her, not to protect him, but to protect me.  I think I'll be alright. She asked me "is there anything I can do for you?" when I told her. My only answer was "please don't push me to go to the cemetery" and she said "absolutely not. I don't even want to go."	9
1	It was unwanted behaviour. Would YOU want unwanted behaviour thrust upon you!?!	9
1	I would have asked to stay in the conversation.	9
1	I already kept a very intense food and exercise regime. It's mostly just so I don't skip out on the gym if I can't be bothered that day! And when we're together we eat and drink well without caring about calories. I know of some D/s relationships where the sub texts meal plans and has to get them approved by their Dom, or texts their entire exercise regime daily, which I personally think is a bit excessive.	9
1	That's rough :( I hope you have the chance to curl up in front on Gilmore Girls with a block of chocolate sometime this week, or whatever your comfort go-to is.	9
1	I will NEVER buy into the idea of "natural" periods for the sake of the experience, but I do like the idea of reminding myself of the power of femininity when I'm most miserable. Like, I feel like it might help to adopt a soothing mantra of "I am a feminine warrior goddess and I have the power to generate life" while curled up in a ball on my bathroom floor.	9
1	HUGS.  That situation sucks, especially when it's never happened before. What happens next really depends on him. This isn't your fault or your responsibility!  If he backs off and is willing to work on getting through his feelings and going back to the bro status quo (status bro?), awesome. If he continues making unwanted advances, cut him loose.   Your boundaries are important and his respect or lack thereof for them says a lot about how much he values your friendship.	9
1	They sound awesome and respectful. Potential friends? Lol. It's so hard to make adult friends.	9
1	You know there's an IRC group listed in the side bar? There's some nice people on there. More of an additional alternative than dismissing your group	9
1	Cyanide is natural too... It's found in the green parts of potatoes.  You don't see me rushing to eat that shit!!!	9
1	Hahaha I really wanted to but I felt like a dirty creeper watching girls through their window at a sleepover	9
1	Waffle benefit kind of sounds like a drive to support your local impoverished waffles... which I could totally get behind.  A better waffle is a better you!  Give 35 dollars and receive this waffle shaped tote-bag.	9
1	Thank you for asking. No pain intended!  No one calls George Clooney a cougar for marrying a woman younger than himself. In fact, there is no term for a man on the prowl, so the term cougar highlights that sexist differentiation: "normal for a man but weird for a woman so let's give it a demeaning title!"   I have not had coffee so if this doesn't make sense lemme know.	9
1	I wish. These are the kinds of conversations I used to have with my girlfriends before we grew apart. Now I'm sad, thanks a lot!	9
1	Of course not! That would imply that we're human beings with real, separate lives. /s	9
1	I'm glad that guys like this are rare. They creep into your nightmares and ruin compliments for you forever but they're still rare, which is good.	9
1	Yes. I am so proud of you for doing this.   After 5 good years it took another whole year of guilt tripping, depression and bitterness to finally get out of my last relationship, and it wasn't perfect afterwards. I was still a mess, but now I'm just climbing back out and it was so, so worth it.  Good luck :)	9
1	Both times I read Kajiji as Kajiht. I think I have a Skyrim addiction.	9
1	NOOOO. Snipping my vag skin while trimming the hairs a little too close is my biggest fear.	9
1	Yeah you know what else is natural? Cancer. I bet if that guy got cancer he wouldn't 'bask in its beauty' as it slowly kills him. He'd probably hop up on all the unnatural chemicals and radiation treatments he could, or try 'natural cures' like Steve Jobs and end up just as dead.   I am 100% for not polluting the earth and natural whole foods and all that, but humans have been making drugs to make our lives easier since forever. If it improves your quality of life and takes away pain, you take them drugs.	9
1	i mean this in the nicest possible way:  can you please just get fucked?  i'm sure you will soon.	9
1	i bet there are lots and lots of people who would love to apply for the postion!	9
1	This is so true. My father has a habit of calling the man in my life "numero uno", then one day I realized *I'm* numero uno goddammit!   Go on and be your bad self, OP! Good for you for putting yourself first!	9
1	looks like you just lost another friend seriboberry  ^^^jks	9
1	feel better! you and that outfit are so cute!	9
1	I can't speak for glowniffler, but I myself avoid wearing them for one simple reason: I *hate* them. lol I specifically look for clothes that I can wear without a bra, especially in the summer.  Of course, I'm still stuck wearing one a lot of the time, which I hate...	9
1	"oh my sweet summer child"	9
1	Um wtf people, respect for privacy much?! Yikes. I'm sure you did what was right for you and don't deserve that crap!  Sorry this happened to you, but Rudy is awesome! And probably a lot more respectful considering that horse's mouth won't talk. And can probably give a mean kick to the jaws of those haters.	9
1	Rudy knows that gossip like that is a waste of time, and is therefore smarter than all those people. You did the right thing for you, gossipers only take the part of the story they want to hear. Hugs and chocolate your way!	9
1	This is sooooo sweet! Congrats girl, you got a good one.	9
1	A pox on all their houses!	9
1	I have come bearing photos!   [The shirt in question](http://i.imgur.com/AyT54NG.jpg?1)!! Aaaaand the unfortunate [proof](http://i.imgur.com/ZJLimGR.jpg?1) that the previous owner cut the tag off :/	9
1	Even those you can often see through fabric. T-shirt fabric these days is infuriatingly thin, and I nearly always have to wear something else underneath so that I'm not showing off my skin tone coloured bra. I have a dark green tank top that you can actually see a skin-coloured bra through. *Dark green*.	9
1	I describe it to people as someone trying to clean out my uterus with a brillo pad. I am glad someone else understands the idea of scraping.  Most people look at me like I am crazy.	9
1	Man here. Hair/beard trimmers are idiot proof and have guards on them. I have a cheap 30$ beard trimmer set aside specifically for my nether regions	9
1	Strawberry ice cream *is* love.   Oh, you meant my SO. Yeah, that too :P	9
1	Run a thin, fine toothed comb upwards through it a little, then leave the comb pressed against your skin. Trim the hair sticking up through the comb, from one side to the other, keeping the scissors flush against the comb. No pokies and no slicies!	9
1	In Denmark that kind of ice cream is called Regnbueis: Rainbow Icecream.	9
1	Don't know if it's actually true, but I read today that she apparently does her own make-up, and is a huge fan of Urban Decay's Naked palette.  Apparently.  Honestly, I think it's very possible that she *usually* does her own make-up, but for pictures and big events, she probably has a make-up artist or two.	9
1	OMG I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE.	9
1	I'll take, "things I learned the hardest possible way" for $200, Alex.	9
1	Doesn't the stubble drive all you shavers crazy? I have to wax. Shaving makes me die of itches.	9
1	Only a month? Oh, you sweet, summer child...  If you're scared to use real scissors to trim it you could try those baby scissors that don't break flesh!	9
1	[Fuck yes!](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/01/tech/12-inspirational-quotes-from-women/)	9
1	I hate the "if it doesn't happen to me, it must not exist!" argument. So closed-minded.	9
1	Periods have never been more fun than in this video. ART.	9
1	[So sorry for your loss.](http://i.imgur.com/Xh6bicV.gif)	9
1	Oh, don't worry, it won't ever go THAT far.	9
1	Maybe he just hates strawberry so it's cool with him! :P I'd take chocolate and vanilla any day over artificially tasting strawberry!	9
1	I assume you took the opportunity to say "What the fuck buddy?"	9
1	Holy shit that is the prettiest applicator I've seen in my life.	9
1	*Fifty-fucking-tw-Fifty-fucking-tw-Fifty-fucking-tw*  God dammit would it kill these gifmakers to include the entire sentence	9
1	Lady engineers unite!! Way to go on two degrees!!	9
1	I know this exact feel. Lost my SO a few days before our anniversary, xanax has been my best friend.	9
1	Ugh. I've been there and it SUCKS.  I'm a math major and went through a few major breakups throughout college. It feels impossible to focus on school when some guy just dragged your heart through the mud. But the thing about exams and deadlines is that eventually you will be on the other side of them. Then you can focus on doing things to help your heart heal.	9
1	My SO got super mad at me a month ago because I accused him of cheating on me. Turns out, I was pretty wrong. My advice is to apologize, and just give him some space.	9
1	Yup, and hair/clothes feel much less creepy than, you know, ass, and mush less generic than "beautiful."	9
1	RIGHT. I DID THE SAME THING.	9
1	Who leaked the info? If it was a clinic employee and you're in the U.S., that's a massive HIPAA violation which should be pursued.  If it was a "friend", I would permanently end all contact with them.  I'm sorry this happened to you. Rudy's awesome!!	9
1	Hey there! Rudy is freaken adorable and fuck those people. It is no one's business what you do with your uterus.	9
1	And I'll actually think good things about you, even if you don't have teeth.	9
1	Yeah, I'm fine now. He didn't talk to me for a couple of days, but he came around eventually and we had a nice long talk.	9
1	**Rudy the abortion horse**  Once upon a time there was a horse named Rudy. She had an abortion. Then she ate hay.	9
1	To be fair, that's how almost everyone's neopolitan ice cream looks. I've never understood why they stick the strawberry in the center when no one wants to eat it.	9
1	We have [rainbow sherbet](http://www.bettervapes.com/assets/images/rainbow_sherbet_0842l.jpg) in the states.	9
1	Trust me, if I had the money to wax I would be all over it	9
1	Props to you! Engineering looks terrifyingly hard to me.	9
1	My husband lets me use his beard trimmer. They are pretty cheap and its so much easier to go over with a regular razor after getting most of it off.	9
1	I got an epilator for my legs but then didn't end up using it as much as I would have hoped... however, there was a trimmer attachment that I use on my lady bits- I'll take trimming it really short over shaving any day. Gets rid of the nethermess with none of the pain/itch.	9
1	girl, i feel you. my boyfriend broke up with me on the day before my LAST EVER COLLEGE FINAL last week. like, could you not have waited two days?	9
1	Flaunt what you got baby I know you're beautiful just by the positive words you just said! You do you!	9
1	["This better not awaken anything in me..."](http://www.adventuresinpoortaste.com/images/snowwhite/image2.jpg)	9
1	I've always heard that Nair can chemically burn those areas of the body where the tissues are softer, such as the genitals, and thus it's really not a good idea.	9
1	👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏  I couldn't be more proud of you for finally getting out! Some people are never strong enough to accomplish even that	9
1	I mean, she's well known for always wearing high street fashion and not being flashy, so it wouldn't surprise me if she did her own makeup as well!  She's pretty down to earth, considering she's literally a princess (although she uses Duchess as her title).	9
1	Insist that he must never wear a cup or protect them in any way because that contaminates the pure experience.	9
1	I had a lady compliment my black floral print dress the other day, she had the same dress. She told me her daughter and her daughter's boyfriend said she was too old for it. I told her, "Tell your daughter to stop being a hater. You're fabulous. My mom wears cooler stuff than I do all the time and totally rocks it!"	9
1	Try hair clippers!! They even make *~girl~* razors that have those on the other end of it. I just sit on the toilet and trim it down before hopping in the shower to shave the rest off. It's so easy since I discovered that.	9
1	I've been getting my eyebrows waxed by the same woman for over a year and I still can't bring myself to get a nether wax. I'm too awkward	9
1	Shaved your *vaj*?  *SHUDDERS*	9
1	Rudy gives zero fucks about other people's opinions and so should you! Internet hugs!	9
1	Everyone has their own skill set!	9
1	Yup. My husband introduced me to this. At first I was afraid so I started with a bigger guard and then slowly went down to this smallest one. Soooo much easier than the old way.	9
1	Am I old?  How do I work this app?	9
1	This is why I don't bother. That, and when I shave it's itchy as hell. Fuck it, I'm a wild woman.	9
1	And you're badass enough in your skill set that you got TWO degrees! That's crazy awesome	9
1	Ahahahaha *cries tears of sadness*	9
1	Hey I recognize that backdrop! I live in that city and I didn't know! :) But seriously, that blows and I'm sorry that people are being gossipy jerks. I hope you continue to feel better!	9
1	Exactly why posting a picture of yourself on the internet with private information is not really the *best* idea.	9
1	Who here is man-bashing?	9
1	He actually also really likes strawberry!	9
1	I like this reaction.	9
1	But strawberry is the best! :p	9
1	Yay Rudy! Does Build-a-Bear make clothes for all the animals? I only had a bear. If so, you should let Rudy rock some kick ass outfits and shoes.   And yay you! Take care of your lovely self and remember that you did what you needed to do *for you*, which is all that is important. And us trolls are always here to support you.	9
1	I'm going to need a weedwacker down there next time I attack it.	9
1	Where's /u/shittywatercolor when you need him?	9
1	Yeah, I'd never put nair in that area. I used it once and it burned a spot on my leg, so I'm really not a fan of that stuff.	9
1	I hope they get herpes.	9
1	I don't shave my vagina since it doesn't have hair, it's an internal organ.  ;)  But I don't have enough to begin with and don't need to shave to wear a suit.	9
1	[Noot Nooot!](https://31.media.tumblr.com/a28d5ad13f1dffe15ed43acd61db0a9b/tumblr_mmir08vTOO1rhchkyo1_500.gif)	9
1	That is amazing! You go! I am almost done with one engineering degree and I can tell you I'm not coming back for a second ;)  Knowing how soulcrushing the studies can be you are a true hero in my eyes!	9
1	And here I thought my BA in Crim was kinda cool :P  Well freakin' done! Oh, and that guy sounds like an insecure dick lol	9
1	But if a woman is attacked, it's because *she wasn't worried enough.* What is WRONG WITH THOSE PEOPLE UGH.	9
1	Exactly! So many comments about how women need to stop being so afraid of men, and clearly this woman was brainwashed. I get that you shouldn't be afraid of every male ever, and I'm sure it sucks to be a guy and have women afraid of you when you're just minding your own business. But these people in the comments didn't really seem to get that unfortunately for women (especially living in cities) it is a reality that if a man is following you, there's a possibility that something bad may happen. And if you're not vigilant, "why didn't you run/tell someone/do something?" Ugh.	9
1	Pretty sure you shake it. If *that* doesn't work, shake it **and** yell at it. You're welcome! :D	9
1	Well they like to blame us for not taking every precaution imaginable to avoid being raped or assaulted and they like to tell us we can't be "paranoid" and just suspect that someone pursuing us is a threat, so, yeah, can't win. Guys could just not stalk us/creep on us, but let's not go blaming the people responsible now; that's just crazy!	9
1	Which redditors?  Which subs?   What toppings and dressing?  do you want a drink with the sub?   SO MANY QUESTIONS OP	9
1	I just think it's really sad that she is spreading this toxic idea of women as gatekeepers of sex, and that men only get married so they can have sex. She's hating on women and men, really.   There are asshole feminists, and also asshole antifeminists, and this woman seems to be one of the latter.	9
1	My dad does that to my mom all the time. They've been married for a long time and should have gotten a divorce a long time ago. As someone who grew up watching that happen to their mother, talk to your boyfriend OP.   With minimal context from you and viewing it through the lens of my personal backstory - this could be an indicator of intense, hidden, douchebaggery.	9
1	That is really awesome for you! And sorry, but I was jut wondering. Was he saying that as in he couldn't believe a girl could get them? I would be asking just because it would seem so impossible.	9
1	It can feel dissapointing, but, he wasn't comfortable and backed away; that's the smart, sensible thing to do. It's not your fault, and maybe he does want to get to know more. If you're just looking for a hookup though, it's perfectly fine to decline.	9
1	How I feel about being a med student, thanks for the good vibes ;)	9
1	Idk why, but no matter how quick I try to be, every shower takes me 15-20 minutes. With no shaving involved xP	9
1	Not to mention the fact that Nair makes your house smell like rotten eggs, farts, and decomposing corpses.	9
1	Blahh people are dumb and I want to shake them.	9
1	I always like to think that those kind of statements reflect more on the person saying them than the person they are directed at.   If it were me, I'd totally to the brush-off approach. "Why do you care so much about my eating habits?", "Wow that was rude.", and "Yeah, stop obsessing over my food habits, it's not cool."	9
1	I was told by guys since I got to college I'd drop a major by the time I graduated. Welp...graduation is Saturday. Somehow I still have two majors. Lol!	9
1	Right?! It feels like when your DVD player used to go out of sync, but on a constant loop.	9
1	Alright, here is what you're gonna do.   1. Throw yourself into work. Studying, homework, projects, whatever. Take on extra. You will have NO EXCESS TIME to think about this piece of shit who broke your heart. NOPE.  2. Delete delete delete. Delete him from everything! Facebook? BYE. Twitter? PEACE. Tumblr? SAYONARA. Get a friend to delete his number too.  3. Hot shower + sweatpants + netflix.   But in all seriousness, this super sucks but you will get through it!	9
1	you have some hair visible?  I don't shave my legs or armpits either, so.  I must ruffle some delicate people's feathers when I wear a bathing suit :p	9
1	This is not going to end well.	9
1	Most commenters there can't even imagine why that woman felt at least uncomfortable. If those guys had twitter It would be full of #notallmen -,-	9
1	I LOVE that the "war on men" is like, not dating them and/or expecting them to pull their weight in relationships, while "the war on women" is passing legislation to restrict what we're allowed to do with our bodies. Same thing though, right?	9
1	"Really? I was hoping to make him Transgender! Is that the wrong shade for that?"	9
1	He's just so pretty!	9
1	Sex and the city. This is Samantha and she is amazing	9
1	In the future, it's probably best to PM this instead of sharing it with everyone on the sub. Despite the profile being public, you just gave out a lot of her info to people who might not have looked.	9
1	Same here, but I think Van is the only place craigslist is bigger- Kijiji runs the show in the interior etc	9
1	[Woo!](http://gfycat.com/QuickGeneralElephantbeetle) Go you!  [Slightly Relevant](http://files.explosm.net/comics/Rob/girliest-drink.png) :)	9
1	[Body shaming sub?](http://imgur.com/fq2c2ZA)	9
1	Complain and you'll probably get a free box. 😂	9
1	It seems like she's owning it now that "everyone knows."  We already have a problem with abortion being something to gossip about.  Good on OP for taking back her agency to share this with us.	9
1	Engineering is hard. Very hard. Congratulations on getting two degrees.	9
1	Haha. Yeah i told them "if hes gay then i dont have to worry about him knocking anyone up in highschool. So whatevs"	9
1	This happened to me a couple of times with fuck buddies. I have a high sex drive, and they basically thought that because I wanted sex more than once a month I clearly must be in love with them. Couldn't have been further from the truth.	9
1	It looks like she isn't concerned with that, which is fine. Some people don't mind being public about their lives, especially considering how much information is regularly posted on facebook.	9
1	be hairy or shave only the bikini line? Get a better bathing suit that your hairs dont poke through?	9
1	Sounds like she is more just upset that people are making a big deal out of it, then again who am I to say what she is thinking.	9
1	I love when I have an unexpected 300 calories at the end of the day, but I'm always worried I've just logged something in wrong.	9
1	You know,  I've been wallowing in my inability to get pregnant.  Fuck that noise.  I AM fabulous. When did I stop looking at myself like Samantha? Sometimes reminders come from the strangest places.	9
1	Pro tip: TrollX hates sentences that start with "as a guy". Plus your flair is kind of offensive, unless you're actually trans.	9
1	Aw love, first of all, fuck yeah engineering lady! Second, go get some ice cream or go on a nice run. Whichever is your fuel. Know that you'll be perfectly fine and cry on your homework if you have to. You know us engineering students do that anyways from time to time! :) Keep your chin up!!	9
1	I don't know you guys, but I am so thankful for all of you. Seriously. ;_; &lt;3	9
1	Not to mention the public outing is a good reminder to the rest of us that we should be vigilant about the same.	9
1	I just gave up shaving and dubbed it "Radagast the slightly darker brown than the hair on my head." Its a wizard that guards my lady treasure.	9
1	Exactly. The internet isn't as forgiving as we'd like it to be. You have to protect yourself, because no one else has the responsibility to.	9
1	My mom always got Neapolitan and my chocolate would be ruined with flecks of strawberry	9
1	This is the sort of thing that if you think about it too much it starts to sound more profound than it's supposed to and it scares you a little.	9
1	It sounds like you may be an asshole.	9
1	Rudy has beaten [this horse](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zr420d-TL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg) as my new favourite horse.	9
1	i know that feel. i'm all, you don't understand. i want sex twice a day. my boyfriend goes to sleep early for work so i only catch him maybe 4 days a week. that means *i'm pretty much constantly horny*. why would you sign up for fwb if you don't want me to hit on you?!?   every boy. they either can't handle me being poly, or they can't handle me actually wanting sex. what. the. fuck.	9
1	Man, how do so many people hate strawberry? Haha	9
1	Probably the last thing you want after months of extreme morning sickness and finally pushing the sucker out of your vagina, is to be tarted up, shoved into shaping underwear, and paraded before cameras, knowing if you look even remotely tired, hundreds of papers and magazines will be discussing how bad you look the next day.	9
1	We both know you're being deliberately obtuse with the vagina thing so I'll let it slide.  Good for you being able to get away with not having to shave but I naturally grow a small National Forest so some trimming is always necessary.	9
1	How many math classes at your university did you not take? I feel like this list would be shorter.	9
1	I don't care what other people do; I prefer to not to have bunch of rough curly black hairs bursting from my nether region.	9
1	*At the same time?!*   I humble myself before your awesomeness.	9
1	strawberry ice cream when done right is super delicious. bad strawberry ice cream is the worst.	9
1	Just remember: every time he does something like this, it's a friendly reminder of what an asshole he is, and how much your life is better without him! :)	9
1	Are they not allowed that?	9
1	This is some ace advice!  Also, this is the time to be extra kind to yourself. Be your own best friend.	9
1	Mom: "I bought neapolitan so everyone gets the kind of ice cream they want."  Reality: Now _no one_ gets what they want.	9
1	Epicfailer10's point was that you didn't have to list out that actual information instead of saying "hey, based on your post history I now know what you look like, your face, and _____." Listing out that information so anyone browsing this now knows her info because you so nicely summarized it for them.   You need to change your original post and remove her info. It looks like it's helpful, but it's not based on the info you included. That's doxxing. No bueno.	9
1	No. But he did something to her sister.	9
1	That sucks. I am a pretty hairy person too. My legs get 5 o'clock shadow... at noon. But still, only cheap thin bathing suits ever reveal anything about the status of my bush hair  and only if one looks closely.   With that in mind, I would say that most people can probably wear bathing suits without a prerequisite of  making their crotch looked like a naked chicken.	9
1	Lol! Tested out of almost all the chemistry classes which kept me at only five years for both majors. But math classes? Idk if they technically qualify as math classes but when you're halfway through the class and celebrating because there is finally a number as opposed to Greek letters...it feels like math class!	9
1	A giant ass excel spreadsheet and five years of careful planning let me get both at the same time. Two separate diplomas (that is very important lol).	9
1	In this case, we wanted to make milkshakes, and this let us make three different flavours :)	9
1	If you meet an asshole once, it was bad luck. If all you ever meet are assholes, the problem is you.	9
1	Ehhhh. I'd still err on the side of caution. He could be saying it under the guise of a joke, but there could be real intent behind it.	9
1	It's baffling to me that people use their limited time on earth to be shitty about things that do not affect or concern them. How sad of a soul one must have to go out of one's way to make the world uglier.	9
1	My rationale is that my pubes are a part of my genitals, therefore, need to be covered. With that in mind I always pick up bikini designs compatible with them.	9
1	Real math classes don't use numbers, so yours count as math! ;)  Source: math major, can't add or multiply ;)	9
1	Thank you! What a cool thing to say! Right back atcha! :D	9
1	I hate that I know this, but sadly, she wasn't even in a bad relationship when she does this. Just one that wasn't right for who she was. (Poor Smith...)  Which I think is a very healthy way to look at some relationships that end, so you can feel better about the fact that they had to end in order for you to be the best person you can/want to be.	9
1	Haha! That's how I felt when I found out my estranged sleazy cheating husband is stuck working retail after moving across the country with his girlfriend instead of the extremely well-paying professional career he had.	9
1	It's a pity, I was thinking about asking him out. I was in a rush so I thought that if I saw him again, or maybe saw him at the movie theater where I was headed, I definitely would.  But no. Dudebro with the Outback Steakhouse smock and broken arm just had to pull some alpha bullshit.  Yes, as I walked away I yelled at him "You think because a girl LOOKS at you, she OWES you something?!"  So... I dunno. Maybe he learned a lesson that day. Maybe not.  To his credit he didn't call me a bitch. So I guess that's something.	9
1	I posted it to /r/niceguys just a few weeks ago. Sad thing is the artist wasn't being sarcastic with this comic. He admitted he was going for the "Women go for jerks" angle.	9
1	Nair burnt my *legs*. There's no way I'm putting that anywhere near my lady parts!	9
1	I won't lie, I would have the strongest desire to scoop it all out and hide it in its own container, then only reveal where it was on my last breathe from the sever beating I would probably deserve.	9
1	I've had guys take a smile as an invitation to harass/follow me, but *never* a douchebrew thing like that. I don't know if "over confident asshole" is a TRP move or something, but that's a quick way to ensure you never get a smile again. A good dress-down/cuss out? Sure.	9
1	If we all hate each other why are all the lady-centric subs and internet spaces so friendly and supportive?  Oh wait, I forgot we're all backstabbing two faced bitches.	9
1	You can't see how skimming through one's post history and one post containing said history is different... Everyone should have to pass a test to use the Internet.   Remove her info from that post.	9
1	The force is strong with that one. But the real question is, how many frozen pizzas can she eat in a sitting?	9
1	Lol good point! You should x-post this in /r/TrollxMoms if you haven't already.	9
1	Wooooo!! OP congrats on your two degrees! I just completed my thesis for my Masters :D	9
1	It's a Mormon school so there are a lot of very conservative rules for the student body.	9
1	He even did that "power pose" thing with his feet planted wide apart.  Man, if he'd just have said "Hi, my name is DudeBro, I'd like to ask you out for coffee because you really impressed me with your smile!" Or something. I don't know. I'm shitty with pickup lines but I hate being told I owe something to men because I was in the same general vicinity they were occupying and I was doing something human with my face. Or whatever.	9
1	Fuck you specifically princessnymphia I bet you're a cute lovely person and that makes me mad	9
1	I didnt even know that was a sub!!!	9
1	Nice! I only know one person who ever double majored in engineering, and it took him 5.5 years.  What field are you going to be working in?	9
1	I also don't think that people negatively gossiping about someones abortion are the kind of people that lurk trollx...	9
1	I'm curious. What's the giant ass Excel spreadsheet for?	9
1	Just let everyone know you're right there with 1/3 of American women! Also, I dig the plaid shirt w elbow patches.	9
1	I think its because tumbler really restrictive rules on gif uploads. (No larger than 1 MB, no wider than 540px)	9
1	No no, they think women only have guy friends because they want a flattering little man-harem because they need "attention".	9
1	That's when you strike back by doing shit [like this.](https://33.media.tumblr.com/efe748a3f828dcbdf8028d4c43ab209f/tumblr_n2ytnbKMv51tqmbqxo1_250.gif)	9
1	Yeah, dude's been watching too many actions movies or PUA videos; nobody's gonna take that shit and they shouldn't have to.	9
1	I would kill to look like Samantha at 52 wowzahs	9
1	You are a superstar and someone will love you again and treat you like the princess you are. Remember that.  Now, see if you can use this sucky sucky heartbreak as a fire to keep you motivated. He already hurt you, don't let him rob you of good marks too!! Throw yourself into this work and prove how much of a strong lade you are by aceing your projects. I believe in you!!	9
1	But blues a boy colour.	9
1	Poe's law in effect?	9
1	I'm glad I'm not the only one.	9
1	[Shoo shoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITi7lG0x0IE)	9
1	I had to combine materials and mechanical engineering. I looked at every class for both majors, when they were offered (spring or fall), and figured out what the best combinations was to get the two majors done in five years. So if something was only offered in the spring, I had to make sure I had every pre-req before that class came around. My advisors didn't like me because I pretty much advised myself!	9
1	Taze them then give them the ol' "bro it was a prank.".	9
1	Something in a manufacturing field. I love being on the production floor!	9
1	He wanted green, but i dont have green. So we settled on blue, he just wanted to be like mommy, amd sissy who i painted her toenails hot pink also.	9
1	Where we used to live there was a lot of street noise so I used to play soft classical music to help drown it out when my boys went to bed. We still do it after the move and my cousin insinuated it would make my boys gay... First, that's not how that works. Second, fuck you.	9
1	Good for you. You made the right choice for yourself when you got an abortion and you made the right choice for yourself when you got Rudy. Fuck anybody who disagrees. You do you, boo. You're going good.	9
1	Make him gay? No, you were making him blue.	9
1	I'm so sorry; I've had that happen before with drunk guys and it's not fucking funny. "Haha, you thought we might gang rape you or hurt you in some way!"...shitheads. Nights like that where I strongly consider upgrading from a Taser to a gun (but I know I shouldn't).  *Hugs* I'm happy you're ok!	9
1	Damn, my son is gonna be SO gay, we play classical music at bedtime too.	9
1	=( call the police?	9
1	Yeah, I'm okay. Thank you! A month ago this sort of thing would have sent me home crying (I have trouble separating past traumas from present), but I've been working on my coping skills and I ended up having a really great night and meeting a few nice people. It just sucks that people do that, you know?	9
1	The police were about 30 yards down the street, I let them know.	9
1	&gt; Hot shower + sweatpants + netflix.  And a big ol' bottle of wine and a casserole.   That's Mama Shannegans recipe for gettin' over relationships.	9
1	Shut up before I eat you.	9
1	I have no real advice but I just wanted to reassure you that you can absolutely do this! A friend of mine went through a messy breakup just before his exams and then came top in the year for engineering at our university. Throw yourself into work and try to be kind to yourself - [this lil guy wants you to be ok](http://imgur.com/gallery/VS5d4)	9
1	Do you count people saying that being overweight/obese is unhealthy as 'body shaming'?	9
1	Good! I hope they were promptly dealt with and you are ok.	9
1	[I love everything about your outfit](https://38.media.tumblr.com/529d9fa19beee25878a8b4663109b9a2/tumblr_mrhyu5uJRT1qlvhryo1_500.gif)	9
1	This thread is such a great example of why I love trollx :)	9
1	Was it because of your gender or was it just because engineering is difficult just in general?	9
1	Why don't you buy yourself one?	9
1	I also live in that city and also had no clue. You and Rudy get onward to some cuddles and more shopping (at a less, ya know, not almost ghost town-y mall) and live yo lives! Feel better lady.	9
1	This reminds me of my ex who used to start yelling at me when I'd pull into Burger King drive through impulsively and say, "Your're going to get fat. Do you really need a Tripple Whopper with Cheese?" To which I would respond "Yes. Yes I do" and then I would unwrap it and eat it sexily. I would eat the entire fucking thing, even if I wasn't hungry anymore just to prove a point. The point was that he should pound sand.	9
1	I hate that. Like okay, you don't think fat is good, that's fine, you're right, being fat isn't healthy...but what's also unhealthy is obsessing over *other peoples' bodies*. Oh no, [someone on the internet is fat!](http://i.imgur.com/uZKW4ls.gif) Those people need a hug or a kitten or maybe some cake because that's fucked up.	9
1	Did you call the police or tell him you would?	9
1	At least he displayed his douchey behaviors early, so that you weren't caught off guard by them while you were actually dating him.	9
1	Mainly because I was a girl. But both I'd say.	9
1	I had a similar spreadsheet when I was in school. I'm a chemE and minored in English and French.   You go girl!	9
1	That was the nicest insult I've heard in a while.	9
1	can't fucking stand spirit animal, am a cougar, this sub can be funky or, more likely, i'm the one with the funk.	9
1	I don't think people who lurk on this sub are going to give her grief for an abortion. It's probably people who are too busy sticking their noses in everyone else's business that are gossiping about it.	9
1	Oh. I was trying to make a joke about the gay remark. He can't be gay cause blue is a boys colour type thing. Bad joke.   I have a 7 yo boy, and I let him do whatever.  Sometimes, he watches Barbie on Netflix. I don't care.	9
1	EVERYONE SHOULD DO THIS DONT DO WHAT I SAID.	9
1	Judging an entire category of human beings based on "people you know" is a really shitty way to approach the world.	9
1	You're probably right, I'm going through a bad break up right now. sorry everyone.	9
1	Thor is awesome! I want to be Black Widow but I'm too lazy to dye my hair red and maintain the color.	9
1	Wow. I guess you mean "student body" rather literally.  What a scary place!	9
1	It is pretty freaky. The dress code for women says "Clothing is immodest when it is sleeveless".	9
1	They really ought to ask themselves what's worse: Mistaking a harmless man as dangerous or mistaking a dangerous man as harmless.  Making the second type of error can get you seriously hurt/raped/whatever. The first error hurts that guy's feelings a little.   But here I am asking default-sub-redditors to exercise empathy, what a concept!	9
1	You're not welcome on this sub. We aren't about that. Please leave. No one wants you here.	9
1	Jesus! Who let thundercunt out of her cage?	9
1	My son has a thing for Strawberry shortcake. Lmao. I don't care. But its annoying as all hell.	9
1	Don't count on much sympathy from this sub - a lot of users here subscribe to FPH :/	9
1	I think there's some brigading happening. I'm very sad trollx has subscribers who go to fph. It's disgusting and it's not doing shit to help women. We should be uniting and lifting eachother up, but instead, we don't even need men to hold us down, we do it enough to ourselves. How fucking sad and depressing, can we just not allow cross subscribers to fph. This is supposed to be a supportive sub for women, letting in the delusion wolves won't contribute anything.	9
1	This is just further proof that you're an engineer at heart! And congrats! My best friend was one of two women in that graduated civil several years ago. It took her 5 years just to get the one degree, so that's incredibly impressive! I know just one can be stressful so you're awesome for taking on two!	9
1	Rudy will be a confidant for life :) Don't let judgey-judgers bring you down too much--it's your life, your body, they don't know it or your situation and you are the one who dictates it. You make your decisions that are right for you and thankfully, you still have the legal option to do so where you are!! I've been there; it is horrible physically and emotionally but you'll be fine with time. Keep your head up and in case you need to talk, please feel free to pm me :)	9
1	Don't feel too bad. After I had an abortion, I got really drunk on pink Franzia and told all my friends. Then I made them all wear my prom/homecoming dresses. You seem to be handling it a lot better.	9
1	That doesn't make it okay.	9
1	Yeah, I've gotten into a million arguments with men, that it is primarily *THEIR* responsibility to deal with the deviants in their gender. (As it is ours.) But they never seem to get the idea that it's necessary for them to take action because #thosetypesofmen do not care at all what women think or feel.	9
1	Thanks! I've never heard that before hahaha	9
1	You should really edit out your edit. I get that you are making a point and trying to be helpful, but its not cool.  Edit: Down voting in response to promoting protecting information? Sweet, thats mature.	9
1	This attitude is pretty much spot on to how I feel.  It's not like the majority of people are *unaware* of the health risks associated with being overweight, so going out of your way to point that out to strangers isn't helping.  It just makes you a dick.	9
1	This is TrollX. I am guessing you think you are commenting to TwoX?	9
1	Da ba dee da ba die...	9
1	OP, I'm not really familiar with your situation, but you shouldn't have to deal with this kind of crap if you don't want to.	9
1	Yasss, this is my current feeling. Like come on, why Monday gotta be so close! I'm nervous that if I blink, sunday will be gone right before my very nose :'(	9
1	Exactly; woman gets it wrong and the guy feels slightly embarassed, indifferent, or awkward. Gets it right and she stands the best chance of escaping being hurt and given a trip to the Hospital and a police report. It's risk assessment, something men are always telling women who get raped/beaten to use or else we get blamed for other people attacking us.	9
1	Working on a civil engineering degree right now! Glad to see Trolls represent.	9
1	Is it weird that my manager and I have this relationship?	9
1	The only times I've seen FPH referred to in this sub is in a negative way	9
1	That would be impossible if I tried it. My pubes grow partway on my legs. :( I would just have to wear shorts. Some of us hairy ladies have little choice but to shave.	9
1	Jesus Christ that is cheap. I think the last wax I paid for in Australia was ~$60!	9
1	Haha, glad it's a joke. Hence my disclaimer regarding my personal back story and limited context from you. :)	9
1	The number of victim's "lying" would be best addressed by removing the cultural stigma involving sex. This would lessen the "regret" many feel that drives that. The number of people who "lie" is not a provable statistic, and it is not uncommon for a victim to be forced to recant thanks to social pressure. This is straw-man argument used by rape deniers to stigmatize victims.  That said, you're decreasing the reporting simply reinforcing the hostile environment involving reporting them at all.	9
1	That's so cute you think I care enough about you to dare venture into the insecure hell that is your user page.	9
1	Me and my wife sat down and ate a whole cake together. No ragrets	9
1	Yup. My ex needs to learn this.	9
1	Yeah that happened to me too yesterday. That kind of hatred is just pitiful to me. :/	9
1	The person you're responding to never said that rates of rape are increasing. They were just pointing out that the statistics can be misleading and giving reasons why. You also seem to be accusing them of arguing emotionally when they don't seem to be. I'm kind of confused as to why you would think this subreddit is an appropriate venue for this debate, or how you even got here given that you apparently prefer TumblrInAction.	9
1	People are quick to jump to body shaming whenever someone mentions weight or eating too much but sometimes it's just because people care about your health... I'm personally anti-body shaming but at the same time the healthy at every size movement is complete bullshit. Being happy with your body is GREAT but don't pretend that you're not putting your health at risk if you're clinically obese. Ugh.	9
1	Thank you &lt;3 I'm not sure they did anything, to be honest, since I didn't have much to go on as far as descriptions.	9
1	Ugh, there's actually a fat hate trollx style sub and we have a lot of crossover with them, disgustingly.	9
1	My future husband and I bought an extra trimmer. Now he has one for his face and we both have one for our nether regions.	9
1	[This, exactly this.](http://i.imgur.com/IgIqAaR.png)	9
1	She's obviously talking about fph/fatlogic...	9
1	"By the power of grayskull!" Damn I'm old.	9
1	That's Tia all day; shit's everywhere, claims to be hyper-logical, but is the most easily offended over things like women being cautious. It's so bizarre and fucked up.	9
1	This post was also only a few days after his new gf discovered she is now pregnant :D   He's already supporting her and her 3 illegitimate kids since she left her job when he moved in. Im laughing so hard. It's nice for once to have tears of joy come from this whole situation, than tears of pain. :)	9
1	I never used a tampon with an applicator and I find this pic TOO fascinating, woah!	9
1	I have a friend that used what he called "calculus math". Everytime he was doing homework he would get mad at himself for using it "Damn calculus math, two plus two is not fucking two"  I thought it was hilarious until I started taking calculus and started doing the same thing :(	9
1	I understand your point of view,  but just because you are not the problem doesn't mean there isn't a problem.	9
1	Thanks for the non-judgemental inclusion of CF. We get a bad rap for very little reason there. A small minority of people there are rude, just like any sub, but because it's directed at children and bad parents we're all monsters, apparently. It can actually be incredibly supportive, especially in a world where you're insulted and even pitied for your choice not to have kids.  I want to go into teaching and don't mind kids, I just don't want one and like to be able to return them to their parents instead of having one 24/7. Apparently that makes me a broken person and a child hater. News to me.	9
1	I didn't know that...that's pretty disappointing when I see how supportive everyone on here are to each other	9
1	I was in that thread earlier, and had much the same reaction. It amazes me sometimes how much people can lack empathy. Can they genuinely not take a second to put themselves in someone else's place?	9
1	My thoughts on this are always "Love your body, and if you love your body, you should keep it healthy".	9
1	FPH and fatlogic are very very different.	9
1	Nothing wrong with him having his own standards, but, yeah, that would be a "let's just be friends" moment for me. I couldn't imagine going over a year with no sex while dating someone, much less waiting until we're married to see how they are at it.	9
1	Seriously, I know too many very gifted girls from high school that decided to get married at 20 and start breeding right away (have to wait for your man, builds character). These girls could have made huge contributions to the world, now they've made many more mouths to feed. Its their decision, but I feel sad about the lost potential.	9
1	I love other people's children. For about 4 hours at a time.	9
1	Too pretty! I'd feel bad gooping it all up.	9
1	That thread was so awful. Not a shred of empathy that this is what women have to do to survive.	9
1	Haha I know, its a real testament to how much I like him that i'm considering it.	9
1	/r/fatlogic and /r/fatpeoplestories have definitely helped me cut out the bullshit excuses I used to give myself...	9
1	Question: What's the second one for?	9
1	Ugh I know.  Go away Monday.	9
1	Because I didn't want to give up physics or chemistry. So the natural solution is to do two degrees. Lol.   edit: Since there's confusion, mechanical engineering = physics heavy, materials engineering = chemistry heavy. I still got two engineering degrees.	9
1	That was kind of the point. This private information of mine has spread so far around this city already. So I'm being upfront and honest. I'm sort of hoping that this sheds a little light onto how much gossip like this affects a person. Maybe you don't even realize it..	9
1	The apartment was disgusting so it all worked out!	9
1	You misunderstand. I'm not denying the problem I just don't like to be told I am responsible for some asshat to get away with something. If I can help I do but I will not sit here and be told that I'm the problem.	9
1	Cops. Cops cops cops.	9
1	You act like I'm giving a pass for people to treat people like shit. I am not. If I see something that I can stop I will but if Johnny dipshit does something 3 towns away from me then I am not responsible.	9
1	No. It was cyber bullying.	9
1	Did he say why?	9
1	If you decide against it, maybe send him my way! ;)  But seriously, that's a tough thing to work through if you are on the receiving end. I hope you find the best solution for you!	9
1	If he actually wanted her to be healthy he shouldn't have been a dick about it. Shame is not an effective motivator.	9
1	More power to you if you decide to; I hope he's totally worth the wait. &lt;3	9
1	Or just "wow what a pretty smile!  Would you like to have coffee?"  I mean, *I* still woulda said no.  Because I'm both gay and married.  But, you know.  I would've been flattered as hell!	9
1	as a writer (and one-trick pony): that sounds *hard as fuck* and i am super impressed either way. i don't know how to math. or science. or do anything that doesn't deal with the alphabet.	9
1	Seriously, there is nothing inherently wrong with waiting until marriage. When it does happen, it just reflects how committed he/she is to that relationship.	9
1	My boyfriend is a health freak and has a weird hatred for french fries because "empty carbs" or some shit. French Fries are my life force. Every time I try to order a large fry, he always says "Do you really need a LARGE??" this is my reaction every time. He can seriously get fucked. I will eat ALL THE FRIES IN THE FUCKING WORLD	9
1	I laid down in the sun for a little bit today, and panicked because I thought a bug was crawling on my leg. It was just the leg hair on the back of my knee moving in the wind.	9
1	No. Materials Engineering = chemistry heavy. Mechanical engineering = physics heavy. Didn't want to major in only one or the other. Wanted to embrace both via engineering.	9
1	Well, I don't usually fuck with anyone.  I'm a mom, so mostly I wash dishes and drink sweet tea.  I also kick the asses of mean people, so I'll back you up.  Can I pet your horse? Edit:  Also, I don't know if we're allowed to direct link or not but head's up for imnotsorry.net, a website with lots of positive accounts of abortions.	9
1	Tiny horses as a coping mechanism. Very Tina Belcher.	9
1	Glad you're coping okay.  Don't sweat the other poster telling everybody your business, it's totally up to you to decide what you do and do not share online.	9
1	Does it matter? It's his choice.	9
1	Get out of here with that.	9
1	Either way someone is in trouble.   I'm really hoping for a HIPAA violation. That means someone may lose their job.	9
1	Repair man *for what*?  Almost every type of skilled repair work pulls in north of $50k/year. The more skilled, the more money. Heck, some electricians and plumbers will pull six-figures.  And no offense, but making fun of his job for making fun of *your* job doesn't make either of you the better person since you both obviously don't understand what's involved for each others' chosen field. :P	9
1	This similar to my decisions now. Math or chemistry? Por que no las dos?	9
1	I just had a similar realization. Went to Target and bought new undies...pure joy.	9
1	I had an icky feeling about someone the other day in our brother-sub and couldn't help myself looking through a few of his comments. Ugh, so disappointed.	9
1	You know what, I saw a few episodes of Barbie's Dream House and it's hilarious.  Total slapstick.	9
1	That's my plan as well! So many fields use both and they're both so closely connected and amazing 💗 chemistry and math lovers unite	9
1	I'm burned out on people telling me my smile is pretty. I know, it's a compliment and I should take it, but it seems to me that it's the ultimate lazy compliment as well as being slightly manipulative because it reinforces notions that a smiling woman is a good woman and she is only noteworthy if she has her mouth pulled back and her teeth exposed.	9
0	&gt; I kind of feel bad saying he's a black man. I'm not even sure if that's racist of me to say.  The white guilt runs deep.	9
0	That's why I shout encourage.  "Get it"  "Kick ass"  "You're doing great"	9
0	Its called porn, not very realistic	9
0	I actually rewatched the show in its entirety after it ended and looked for clues. Either I'm totally oblivious or the writers just added that ending for shits and giggles.	9
0	For real, checked earlier today and now I got that and Backstreet boys playing on Google music. "You hit me faster *than a shark attack*"....oooh yeah!	9
0	NO REGRETS!!! WE'RE IN IT NOW TOGETHER!	9
0	Change the genders to "person" and "they". Does it really sound so bad?  "The person you marry cares about your career and your vision of life as well as their own. They know you also have a plan, and works together with you to achieve the goals you both have. The marriage is their priority." Seems okay to me.	9
0	According to Reddit the protesters are overreacting and behaving like animals. God forbid anyone have problems that aren't experienced by white males who spend all day on the internet. You even try to suggest that the racial issues these people are protesting are valid and important and you get pages of hateful idiocy thrown at you.   The willful ignorance is overwhelming.	9
0	I dont get what the problem is here... Just a girl into girly things and want to try them. Its one thing for her to wear it out in or to school. But if she wants to play with makeup at home or playing with friends... I dont see why thats a problem.	9
0	The guy whose work I was talking about is just regurgitating the popular Korean game art style from like 10 years ago. All of the rest of my illustrator friends, male and female, are outspoken feminists and they draw realistic looking armor and physiques. Guess which is more in demand. Yeah. My feminist friends! I'm glad to see the industry is changing for the better.	9
0	At school yes.. but at home? Meh, dont see a problem with it.	9
0	It sounds to me like the person who wrote this should **really** have gotten to know the girl he dated more before he married her.	9
0	Or you could not be lazy. You're making some poor janitors life hell. We all have them. Wrap it up and walk 5 ft and trash it. Geez.	9
0	If her mom didn't want her to have it that's fine but I don't see what the problem is.  My mom gave me make up samples she didn't want when I was little to play with.  It's like playing dress up, just don't let her wear it everyday.	9
0	I've never been in a bathroom that didn't have some kind of disposal facility.  Even so, you take it with you. It's your garbage.	9
0	Its horrible, I'm 25, and I don't ever remember being like that at 13, I know around 17 I was pretty bad, but then again I was interesting in girls, not guys. My biggest worry was if my blacks matched.	9
0	Can't brain anymore. :/	9
0	Noooo! Why? Making me reconsider moving to Canada.	9
0	I loved SG-1, better than Atlantis or Universe. I'll tell you, America may suck at education, healthcare, poverty, corruption, and labor protections, but at least we can watch some SG-1. :'( (For you.)	9
0	Haha thanks! I got a bunch of the Lego friends. Sadly, while the bricks aren't different, the mini figs are a huge ripoff and made to look like barbies.	9
0	I'm sure its also a hassle for whoever has to clean up the mess. Its not their fault there's no proper way to dispose of sanitary product. I'm sure they don't want to unclog a toilet or be ankle deep in dirty water because its so inconvenient for you to switch hands and wipe. Its not hard. Wrap it up, sit it on the floor/back of toilet wipe and flush. Then carry it to the trashcan and wash your hands. I'm glad I could clear that up for any of you girls struggling.	9
0	what classes are they?	9
0	Nooooo! I'm a man (shh, what the grills don't know won't hurt me, oh, wait, shit, now they know) but I have to cry now. :'(  E: typo	9
0	NUUUUUUUU that's horrible!! D:&lt;	9
0	I mean... I don't have this problem. I'm sorry that you do. And that's genuine, but once again, consider whatever the poor janitor/ plumber's anxiety might be cleaning up period shit toilet water. That's ew.	9
0	Hey I feel ya. If it were a perfect world they'd all have those little side bins. They should come stock in bathrooms. Dunno how that's not common place. Have you ever tried/heard of implanon? Its my birth control and I haven't had a time of the month in a couple years. If that kinda mess actually causes you anxiety and you're cool with birth control, maybe you should check it out! Might help :)	9
0	correct me if i'm wrong but doesn't this not really belong here? I think it would fit better on twoX's image fest friday.	9
0	Past 12am on Thursday, so it seemed ok...?	9
0	The acting in SG-1 was convincing for me, Atlantis and Universe seemed like they were trying too hard to sell the roles they were playing.	9
0	I always flushed mine, but a couple years ago we had to call a roto-rooter guy because everything backed up in our house. It was horrible and terrifying. There was a tree root blocking or pipe, with years of tampons backed up. The guy had a chat with my husband, who had a chat with me. So now I only flush them about 20% of the time. Flush them 100% of the time at work, because I don't want to stick my hand in the tiny disposal things.	9
0	Exactly. I hate filler/recap episodes, no matter the genre, the filler/recap episodes piss me off to no end. Universe was so shitty, was basically lost in space, but with less interesting characters.	9
0	Maybe forgot a word?	9
0	Why don't you set it down once wrapped and just take it with you. I assume you do wash your hands when you're done in the bathroom so it shouldn't be an issue to pick it up. Please stop trying to justify why you think it's ok to be lazy and inconsiderate.	9
0	People are lazy and ignorant.  They will do anything if it means they don't have to bother themselves for two seconds.	9
0	Yes! This was posted a while back on /r/blackpeopletwitter too	9
0	Just want to let you know I'm 24....	9
0	There is soooo much I *wanted* to say! I think if I even said the word 'sex' she would have a heart-attack or something. [And she wonders why I never visit...](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr05/9/11/anigif_enhanced-buzz-30949-1381333276-6.gif)	9
0	Gramps....crass???	9
0	"Did you say something"?	9
0	Why is it so important that sex toys look like they're not sex toys? Are you girls really keeping them in plain sight, walking around with them in your hand, or leaving them on your desk at work?	9
0	calling bullshit on bullshit is mean now?	9
0	I'm just really glad I'm not the only one who drinks vodka cherry coke. The LOOKS I have gotten from bartenders...	9
0	imo, that man's marriage is his responsibility, not your friend's. unless she is coercing or otherwise forcing him into a relationship, it is not her problem that someone else's relationship is being violated.	9
0	Upvote all The Guild! It's stuff like this that makes me wonder if I should make another account for showing people reddit.	9
0	Fuck he's only 21?  Shiiiiiiiit.  Fun fact: I'm an alto and enjoy singing along with him in the same register as him.	9
0	But I *like* dresses!  I can see what the point is, but it seems like another "traditionally feminine things are weak and bad" statement.	9
0	And the Hitachi Magic Wand is literally a muscle massager! But lets be honest here, we're among friends.	9
0	6:30? I didn't read the entire thread. That changes things.	9
0	This is amazing. I'm saving all of these for future reference.	9
0	I'm just saying two wrongs don't make a right. We don't change social trends by culling out the people who don't fit into our ideals.	9
0	I think people should try to always be polite, even if someone else is being a total butt. He sucked but she stooped to his level. Well, maybe not quite his level.	9
0	:(  I don't think ostracizing people for being jerks is going to help anyone. Isn't that how you get the people who go on murder sprees?	9
0	but there are ways to do it that don't involve fat shaming him. There's always a nice way of doing everything.	9
0	Yes, you are.	9
0	I wasn't trying to say they were the same. My saying "not quite his level" was meant to be an understatement.	9
0	&gt; she don't know fuck all about.  Yeah you're correct. I hate using the excuse of someone being envious. Im not a mean/spiteful person so I dont understand where those feelings come from. I feel a lot better after getting input from y'all though. Thank you.	9
0	I guess I can buy that. No one should have to endure someone like this.	9
0	You have zero interest in the same women.  I'm sure your father doesn't care to date lesbians.	9
0	ngl, I'm kind of disappointed in all the people who think random insults about someone's appearance constitutes holding your own against some texting dude you'll never have to see again.  If she did want to lash out (because that's what it was) there were any number of legitimate things she could have said about his personality that would have been just as cutting without shaming him for an aspect of himself that hurts no one.	9
0	Why are you here?	9
0	Why would you assume that is the reason? Is that the only reason you could think someone might choose to do that?  Is it not possible that the rejected guy is simply having trouble accepting a decision without an explanation (not that he is owed one, but you know people prefer to be able to understand things rather than just accepting) and is able to respect the idea that she is in a committed relationship. This is something nicely not related to his failings.  Of course, it could be either. But to assume just one is absurd.	9
0	Er... I may be in the minority, but if my wife was gonna give me great sex because some other guy get her going, I'd be pretty upset.	9
0	True. My call is that I want my wife to have great sex with me because *I* make her sexually aroused. I get that I'm not the only person a woman will ever find attractive or be aroused by, but when you're having sex with me, I'd prefer it be because you want to have sex with *me*.	9
0	Is there some reason why you have to spend any time listening to her at all?  I just  lose contact with horrible people like that.   You aren't obligated to take it, and you'd be much happier with her out of your life.	9
0	Aka *"I wanna say the N word soooo baddd..."*	9
0	Aw, I missed your first post but I'm glad you're doing a bit better, but still sorry you're going through this.  Us trolls are here for you too!  *hugs*	9
0	The comment I replied to wasn't referring to the post.  &gt;Total side note  The guy in the post was an idiot. A *racist* idiot. And not one who only respected the man OP was with, and not the relationship. He respected neither OP, the relationship nor the boyfriend. But that isn't relevant to my comment or the one I replied to.	9
0	Ah, the old, "There are worse problems so the problem you're describing donesn't matter."  Why do you think those women are shamed for being feminine? Because it's not seen as powerful on it's own.	9
0	At least I wasn't the only one	9
0	I LOVED the series. I was referring to the fact that the ships are alive and can pretty much sail themselves.   If you had a hard time with that, you probably don't want to hit her Rainwilds Chronicles. You get a decent amount of that with the character Thymara, but there IS a lot of empowerment, and regardless of the self pity, those two sets of books (Liveship Traders and Rainwild Chronicles) remain some of my very favorite books.	9
0	But EVERYTHING is better with cherry coke! Sometimes to be extra weird I add in kahlua, so it's like a bastardized Black Russian. Something halfway between a Colorado Bulldog and a Black Russian, but with a hint of cherry goodness.	9
0	He's just really pissed that he's not stereotyped as having a big cock. Massive over compensation.	9
0	The butthurt is strong with this one. I think you have a new stalker! :D	9
0	I can appreciate that.   My feelings are this. I know this is out of context, but I feel that it's true to this situation.   "In a real sense all life is inter-related. All persons are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be, and you can never be what you ought to be until I am what I ought to be. This is the inter-related structure of reality." --Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.	9
0	Don't worry, it probably didn't actually happen. OP had another post 5 days ago about how she met her bf in  an online bondage forum. So either that was a lie, or this is. Or this is just something she grabbed from r/niceguys, which also means it probably isn't real.	9
0	&gt;(not that he is owed one...  I don't think anyone *has* to explain themselves. But we all know that rejected people sometimes *want* an explanation.	9
0	Do you not see the difference between "I am tired of femininity being used as something 'lesser' because it is pretty cool and awesome in it's own way," and "Wahwah, people don't like my pretty frock?"	9
0	Yes please, babies are cute and have tiny noses and tiny feet and I want to squidge them!	9
0	Definitely relevant, but you weren't referring to the post specifically. You were speaking generally, as I was.	9
0	I've definitely had this thought.	9
0	Like I said: If its from niceguys, it's probably faked. They love to circlejerk. I think it's a rule the punchline has to be "fuck you bitch, you're ugly anyway!"	9
0	:) You're a lovely human being.   Maybe I'm not the best at delivering a message with the sentiment that matches my intention. I feel like I'm someone who is full of kindness and love. It would make me sad if anyone thought that anything I said was meant with any other sentiment than that. It seems like you are better at that.	9
0	lol having a father around is overrated anyway.	9
0	OK, I'll accept your 'something more definitive' argument, but it didn't need to be throwing people of size under the bus.	9
0	I lost it when she farted in his face. My chest my hurts now.	9
0	I mean, "nigger" DOES mean "an ignorant person".	9
0	I also agree but the "you're way overweight" thing also irks me	9
0	I have had very different experiences cleaning washrooms than you! I've always found the mens are filthy with pee and poo everywhere. The ladies tend to be..wetter around the sink and maybe some pee on the toilet seat. But we aren't capable of spraying it like the boys are. :P	9
0	Me neither but from context I'm pretty sure it is a very offensive and disapproving way to say 'dating a black person.'	9
0	&gt; UPDATE #2: It's just come out that the girl's allegation was false. No explanation as to why since she apparently hadn't named anybody, just provided descriptions. Hell, it's not even clear if she was the one who filed the complaint.  This should really be the top comment.	9
0	It's absolutely not her responsibility.	9
0	what is the correct way then?	9
0	We just have an unspoken understanding with each other to not complain about each others' loud sex because we're both pretty guilty of not being able to keep it down :P	9
0	Everyone needs a hobby and who are we to judge. :)	9
0	Why not both? I get really gassy before my period and for the first couple days during. So I know if I'm getting my period usually, haha...  I hate my periods. I wouldn't have them at all if I could! I'm down to once every three months and it's great! Except for the week of my period (or goo week as it's known in my house). That still sucks.	9
0	You are awesome and I hope you find $20 on the ground today. &lt;3	9

0	I think I have the first rainwild book in e-book format. Do you have a way to read it? That way it's no cost to you if you hate it.	9
0	I haven't actually read Pride and prejudice. I can give it a shot tho. I bet someone else did it already....It was like, a thing on Twitter yesterday. Hash tag clickbaitbooks	9
0	Sending this to my non-feminist boyfriend right now!	9
0	This whole thread is just wat	9
0	You're going out with a non-feminist? Is he actually a feminist but not willing to call himself one?	9
0	He believes in equality, but says that he doesn't feel any obligation to identify as a feminist. He believes people need to "walk the walk, not talk the talk". I've tried to convince him otherwise but haven't gotten through to him yet.	9
0	Are you aware that most women don't handle a basic "no" well either? Dealing with rejection like this is not a specific gender issue.	9
0	I kinda feel the same way about a lot of the references here, being neither American nor a woman...	9
0	I can't identify him as a feminist because he chooses his label, I don't. I tried telling him that he is basically a feminist, but he said that he is just a rational human being who doesn't think women are inferior. He shouldn't be forced to put the feminist tag on himself. (his words, not mine)	9
0	If you feel like crying, go ahead and cry.  Women's tears are like men's kryptonite. He will feel embarrassed and helpless, which frankly is already what you feel, and then you can be brave and rub it in his face when you find someone new who magically does not make you cry-- a task that he failed at, like a big stupid failure.  It's not manipulative, it's exactly how you feel.	9
0	sure but that kind of thinking is encouraged EVERYWHERE  god forbid the shoe be on the other foot for once.	9
0	I think it has a lot to do with the fact that guys have been educated by romance movies that all preach that perseverance is the best quality a guy can have. Add to that the hurt of rejection, and you get an upset guy who only knows "try harder".	9
0	Hit the gym girl and leave the dude	9
0	Their love may have seemed cliche, but when I saw what he did for her family I WAS ASTOUNDED!	9
0	Maybe... maybe he's pavlov'ing you.   Think about it: You fart, he says 'I love you' every time.   Now, if you fart when he's not around, you'll suddenly feel alone and empty, for you have not received your fart-love.      Every fart without him will be a sad fart.	9
0	This is why I love Victoria's Secret shops I feel like they're much more aimed at women, more like "you should feel pretty" rather than "this will make you sexy"	9
0	Well, just like my mother,  you're gonna have to get over it bc it's not changing.	9
0	At that point it's probably not immaturity, but instead a fear of being charged with some sort of sexual crime.	9
0	Check the Meninist twitter.	9
0	From one of those women, I'm sorry. I'm under 5'2" and my SO is around 6'4".	9
0	So why exactly is he your SO if he is not attracted to your body?	9
0	Sounds like she's projecting her own issues. Either her own bad childhood or her own husbands lack of interest in fatherhood.	9
0	Oh I will be, I'm so blessed.	9
0	You know he just said it to get a rise out of you.  More satisfying response would be to laugh in his face.	9
0	As a male, after 7 years it may just be time to switch things up a little and do some freaky-deaky stuff. I mean missionary isn't bad, but some new ways every now and then can be really fun.   Also 50lbs over 7 years isnt that much really, thats like 7.14 lbs a year, I dont think I would notice that unless I was really really really really really paying attention and Id probably start to wonder how I had started to look.	9
0	Clearly U need to hang out in places less frequented by creepy guys	9
0	How to please a man (from a comedienne's I can't remember unfortunately):  If he's hungry: feed him.  If he's horny: fuck him!  I found those rules effective.	9
0	It's mainly because these "warriors" typically just retweet something cutting with whatever hashtag is trending and figure they've done their bit for social justice. IMO, it has more of a flavor of "Monday morning quarterback" mixed with the venom of a British "tch."	9
0	Hey you know, that just the way it is sometimes. I'm still bitter about some of my past relationships and it doesn't negatively effect my life. Sometime I think forgiveness is over rated	9
0	Just a joke ladies; not what I actually think of shorter guys. Have no problem with them.	9
0	Holy shit. Is that made by someone with no knowledge of history or a complete fucking idiot?	9
0	This happened to me, and it sucked! I'm so sorry to hear you have to go through this. I ended up leaving him, and a month later found a funny, sweet, HOT guy who thinks I'm sexy as fuck.  So if you feel like you can't do better, don't feel that way. You can! That said, if you'd prefer to work things out, make sure he still treats you with respect. :)	9
0	As levy said, look into other hormone BC options, or even non-hormonal ones like Paraguard IUD. I wanted to break from BC pills for similar reasons you have and that's the route I took; no regrets. My SO still uses condoms to.	9
0	I'm guilty of doing something like that (but hopefully not as aggressively). When a girl says she's not interested, guys can sometimes change her mind and get her to give him a chance. Everyone knows that couple that's perfectly happy but the girl rejected the guy the first time. But when a girl says she has a boyfriend, she's taken and there's no way you can change her mind.  But that's just how I feel about it. Maybe most guys do only respect women if they're another man's "property."	9
0	This sounds like dejah moo....as in the feeling one has heard this bullshit before. Use this as an opportunity  to move on and look for a new job. They more than likely have the miney. Managers rarely tell the truth. So make your own pay raise  by moving on up to a new gig. Good luck.	9
0	Me too. It's ok. Also I'm a boy.	9
0	Yeah... plopping down a 2 weeks's notice with the heads up that you've been offered a job paying more elsewhere will have a magical effect on the purse strings. They will open like the horny legs of a teenager on prom night.   The way to get a raise is to be willing to _leave_. Either the company you're with finds the money or you jump into a job that already does.	9
0	Uhhh... that doesn't actually happen very frequently. If it happens to you a lot, then by definition you are not using it correctly.   And by that logic-- what happens when you forget to take your pill? "*all it takes is one time.*"  Also, Morning After pill, FTW.	9
0	Holy cow. Thank You! I just got into Steven Universe. I have such a crush on Garnet.	9
0	This guy is totally absolutely in the wrong and it would infuriate me too. But is it really appropriate to come at him for his weight? That just feels like stooping to his level, and kind of a low blow.   Edit: You know, downvote all you want but I can't understand how personal attacks are only condemned when misogynists make them. I'm a female, I'm a feminist. I don't attack another person's appearance. I don't want my appearance attacked, so I don't do it to other people.	9

0	I don't mind second best, given that all are so elite.  Also sometimes the example is more important.  Look at how First Nations, Inuit community's are recovering from genocide.	9
0	Short hair doesn't equal unattractive. However, short hair on this particular frame and face wouldn't be nearly as attractive as the current or former length. She has beautiful hair, as well as a gorgeous face, but not a face that one would want to see a pixie cut on.	9

0	Yeah, logically I know this. And that the advice I would give to anyone else: You’re pace is your own and fuck anyone who said otherwise. I just wish my feelings and confidence went with it. It’s frustrating because I feel inadequate and I *know* I shouldn’t. :/	9

0	Are you sure that the server didnt give you the wrong plates?	9
0	I don't agree. This post could be labeled META if anything. What OP is calling out is the kind of bullshit posts we've been seeing since this sub made it to /all and I would like some discussion on how to get us back to being funny and fun, not killjoys.	9

0	If I was alone I would throw myself between the two fighters, facing the most aggressive one so I could block his punches if I had to.

The fact that I was the only patient there should have clued me in.  I just don't understand why I'm being charged more than my ER co-pay.  I've been to the real ER before and never had to pay more than that.	9
0	Stupid question but why would you be "crying your guts out" if you are the one who broke things off?  Doesn't that call for a celebration instead?	9

0	What is the "colourful tissue paper in the mail"?	9
0	That seems like the response of a reasonable and mature individual.	9
0	Someone obviously did not want to deal with your particular brand of crazy. So you stalk them, track them down at their place of employment, and proceed to physically assault them. There is no excuse or reasoning in the world that would make any of that okay.	9

0	No one, of the comments I've read. I just felt it was something that needed to be touched on. Something I forgot to mention though, why is it a bad thing that this article was written by a woman? Maybe she, like myself, is sick the hypocrisy present in today's "feminists". At the best, most of the so called feminists I meet today would be considered extremists. They're not chopping off people's heads, but the violence they commit is passive and does far more damage over time.	9

0	That's why there are abortions. Problem solved.	9
0	That's what happens when buying tampons at the dollar store.	9
0	Denoting it sets us apart from men doing likewise. We shouldn't need to feel empowered to date someone younger by means of a term.   By all means, call yourself anything wanted. And it isn't being downvoted that gets me, it is why I was downvoted: I politely brought up a point. I don't see how that is hostile enough to warrant it. This is symptomatic, to me, of how this sub has changed -- that is my bigger point.	9
0	Thank you. I need more coffee.	9
0	So what if someone can see your bra? Like its some big secret that women wear bras. Same with panty lines.	9
0	Seems more like she doesn't particularly care about facts of her life being made public, but is facing criticisms and getting 'helpful advice' about choices that are not only completely up to her, but considering their medical nature should also not have been the subject of gossip.	9
0	Yes, you are. You are responsible for dealing with the asshole men you encounter who think such behavior is okay, in much the same way I am responsible for addressing the bitches I've encountered who treat men like shit.   The effect is much greater when it comes from your own gender, you can't use the stereotypes to "oh, but it's just a joke" out of it.   Gold star for allowing the bullshit to continue through your lack of understanding of the social construct of these issues. The harassed, abused, tortured and victimized every where thank you.	9
0	Think I would ask this to another guy as well.	9
0	Will have to submit sometime, then.	9
0	I second that if it's too much, but I shave every few days, but when I was 8 months pregnant I could barely see it and a few days before my due date I had to shave and it took me an hour.  haha. I used scissors first and it helped. And use men's shaving cream. They use it for beards and it lathers soo much better than women's. It stinks, but I use women's on my legs.  Oh, and buy the rive blade razors.	9
0	Sounds like you got zero engineering degrees? Not that it's not impressive, but engineering isn't synonymous with science...   Unless you mean the physics/Chem aspects of the two engineering degrees?  Edit: Thank you for teaching me that asking a question about an unclear statement is frowned upon in this sub. I won't make that mistake again, I promise.   Edit2: /u/170612 kindly explained to me why I was getting downvoted so much. Thanks to them for the explanation and sorry to /u/tinparrot if my tone sounded rude! I didn't intend it that way.	9
0	Wait....what? Physics and chemistry isnt engineering.	9
0	I don't mean to make fun of his job, I just couldn't stand the fact that he laughed right in my face. He came to repair something elsewhere, I have no idea. He mentioned the money, but as someone who is hoping to go on to do her masters in Art Psychotherapy I feel like I will find more fulfillment from my work. He just really pissed me off.	9
0	Are you sure they're referring to you being a woman? I'd be (good-naturedly) incredulous of any *person* who got two engineering degrees. Might be projecting misogyny where there is none.  Also, singular or plural?	9
0	Asking for clarification makes me an asshole... Okay.   When she said "I didn't want to give up physics or chemistry so I just double majored" was it perfectly clear to you that she meant mechanical and materials engineering?   It wasn't to me, and I don't think it was unreasonable to ask what she was talking about/ ask for clarification.	9
0	But I don't need my nose picked	9
0	Like I said, I don't intend to put his job down, I only mentioned it to show what he was doing.   I don't know why people keep mentioning the money. I get that typically artists are known for living in borderline austerity, so maybe people are trying to say his work is better because he has money?  My work will involve re-socialising people, helping people with depression, possibly helping to avoid suicide. Honestly I would call that work more fulfilling than repair work. Maybe thats just me.	9
0	Honestly, no one fucking respects art degrees and that pisses me off! I'm about to finish my freshman year of college and I'm undecided, but I've always loved all types of art and have been considering going into the art school here. All my friends (especially guys) in majors like business try to tell me I should get a more useful degree.  Like fuck you dude. On another note, congrats on finishing!!!!	9
0	Damn, I got destroyed for posting that.   People seem to think that is an accusation for not being a physics major. Physics is the hardest undergrad degree imo	9
0	I want to see the guide.	9
0	I work in a kitchen washing up, I get the blue collar work thing. I'm one to talk about labouring jobs! But again, the money thing. This might sound stupid and naive but I don't really care about the money. If I cared about money I would have probably chosen to avoid the artistic field.  I'm usually surrounded by people who find the value in the arts and more specifically their value in relation to mental health. People I know, think its important. It was such a shock and offense to find some random man laughing and eye rolling at it!	9
0	Ya, I can definitely see how it could be interpreted that way. I was really blunt, but it came from a place of caring as a warning.	9
0	Yeah! Its hard sometimes, especially if the people around you don't see the worth of your degree. If I could offer you some advice, surround yourself with people who are passionate about the arts, people who think the arts are valuable.   And thanks! Good luck to you! :)	9
0	It was just a shock because I normally say what degree I'm doing with a bit of humour in my voice, you know, there's a stereotype that artists are dumb, are always poor, are lazy etc. so I don't expect too much when I tell people what I do. But for him to actually react like that!? The cheeky bastard.	9
0	I know well paid artists in the video game industry and dirt poor trade workers; there may be differences in availability and demand but that's not relevant to passion. I hate that College and even Trade school is looked upon as the job assembly line, rather than the pursuit of higher knowledge and education in what you're interested in or passionate about. If everyone went for business majors the world would a very dull, drab, horrible place.	9
0	There are of course, high earning artists/designers etc, but for the most part, I would say that the world has a very particular view of artists (think the bohemians in Moulin Rouge). When I left school and went to uni I had no idea what I actually wanted to do, how I would earn my living etc. so I went to uni (in England we were just kind of steered towards it) to do the one thing I love and spend all my free time on.	9
0	There are some awesome quotes in there. Good job!	9
0	Well, there's also the part about going into massive debt to pay for it, whereas people in the trades either don't have to do schooling, or have it subsidized by their apprenticeship program. I don't think people shit on arts degrees *because* they're arts degrees, but because you spend so much to make so little (on average). Signed, a person who dropped out of her arts degree to get a trade.	9
0	&gt;this could be an indicator of intense, hidden, douchebaggery  Or an indicator of a man who's concerned for his girlfriend's health.	9
0	Just in the general sense of being downvoted here, it seems that most things get downvoted first, then hopefully the gals will kick in and upvote you back where you belong. Although I have seem a few stray comments that are downvoted for no noticeable reason. I don't downvote anything unless it really doesn't belong here.	9
0	It's called denial. Sometimes people need a wake up call. If someone you love has a drug or alcohol problem you would speak up, maybe even have an intervention, right? Why not if someone is killing themselves with food?	9
0	As someone who has had a reactiongif misinterpreted (resulting in copious amounts of unwanted boyfriend bashing) I am glad to see you handling it with better grace than I did.	9
0	In England its not that scary to go to uni, student loans pay for tuition, everyone gets extra for living etc. We don't have to pay it back until were out of uni and earning over 21,000 a year, and even then its only 9% of your wage. I think that here, its more because people think its unlikely that you'll find it hard to make a wage from your degree and you'll end up wasting it and working in something unrelated.	9
0	And getting fat to spite someone who actually cares about you is what, exactly?	9
0	Thanks! To be honest, your post and recent events in my life have kind of inspired me to pursue a degree in the arts. The people I've been hanging out with more recently are a lot more supportive of that. Lots of acting/theater/cinema majors and just more open-minded people :)	9
0	I'm a guy and I don't really like make up either.  I feel it mostly just obscures their face.  I definitely don't feel tricked about it though, it's pretty easy to tell when there's make-up on.  It is very much so harder to tell what their face looks like though.	9
0	I have a theory that female-dominated subs tend to downvote more strongly and comment less adversarially because they are trained by the rest of the internet that their voice is easiest to have when it's silent. You only see serious downvotes in a sub like /r/askmen when you're deliberately being an arsehole. Here and in /r/askwomen, you can get to -20 before you can edit in an /s.	9
0	Don't know why you were down voted. There a lot of people I don't respect because of the choices they've made.   Myself, for one. ;)	9
0	Seriously, how does this comment get upvoted on TrollX? /u/rasberrykoolaid is exactly the kind of hateful bully OP is talking about.	9

0	Bull-fucking-shit.  They're cut from the same cloth of paranoid, conspiratorial shit of "there's a cabal of fat people who wants to shove their fatty fats down our skinny throats", the same way assholes of Reddit think there's a cabal of "Feminazi" SJWs, trying to take over their video games and comic books.	9
0	Ummm to be fair I would ask the say the same thing as the guy. Not cause your a girl because it is actually Really hard!!! I think Your just looking for sexism where there isn't in this particular case.	9

0	I think you should stop.  Sharing your ridiculous opinion.  Edit: -40? Okay my comment wasn't well thought out but really. But do you think it's appropriate to tell someone to break up because their partner has a different religion? Are you fucking kidding me? Most religious people are lovely and just because they have faith doesn't mean they're going to be a bad/demanding partner. Have I stumbled into /r/atheism?  Wtf trolls. Wtf. This is some 1950s don't mix with other cultures type shit and you're supporting it. Disgusting.	9
0	From Troll Y's sidebar. Apparently that's why I've been getting downvoted. :/	9
0	That's the sky I want to have over everyone in TrollX! &lt;3	9
0	Good for you! I was a double major up until a week before graduation, then I had to cut one due to failing one course twice due to medical reasons. I kind of have a dream of going back one day and taking the class for my other degree, but as its a BS in television screenwriting I'm not sure it's worth it.	9

0	It may be true that men would be more likely to listen and follow other men over women, but I really don't think it's anyone's responsibility to police their own demographic. *You* might personally want to hold them responsible, but that argument doesn't hold any weight...  An even nicer but equally unmarketable idea is that everyone is responsible for everyone else, and I can live by that if I want, but I would never go up to some dude and tell him that he has to, too. And I certainly wouldn't single someone out because they have the same gender/race/whatever as the jerk in question. That's not cool.	9

0	all I'm saying is don't demonize all men and vivify them, cuz some men/women are horrible. [that can be a very toxic outlook](http://www.handbagmafia.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MM.png)  but it looks like this whole board is vilifying me, for trying to show the other side(not you yourself) I think I've had it with trollX I try and be around differing view points, this board has been getting more SRS for months now, and I may even have been getting brigaded for this shit.	9
0	I guess Ive seen that concept used in larger scale in the past to ostracize men, and a way to hate them. why cant we be like [bill and ted](http://ageofinquiry.com/sites/ageofinquiry/files/styles/feature_image/public/Bill%20and%20Ted%20-%20be%20excellent.jpg?itok=ZIDbuxVo)	9
0	&gt;I'm fairly sure that a certain proportion of ~~young men~~ *all people* are just completely incapable of being considerate of other human beings.	9
0	No I am saying that you don't need to demonize men to feel safer. but you don't want to hear that you just want to vilify the other side.  I was at a meet up today with some actual victims and they said the side this board it trying to push doesn't help anyone.	9
0	How does one end up with ripped up panties?????	9
0	Not sure what sex has to do with how it's installed. It's a waste basket for feminine products right? Probably had the directions upside down.	9
0	I could see that. I was kind of imagining panties in shreads. Most of mine are pretty new so maybe that's why I didn't get it right away haga	9

0	She is DEFINITELY representative of ALL bi people, who all function exactly the same!   Do some research if you're curious dude.	9
0	Ok I see the data now(idk why i couldn't find it in searches, and thanks for the source). and I know this is not a inconsequential amount, and I'm not trying to trivialize it.   but looking at this data It looks like men are almost twice as likely to be violently assaulted from a stranger in 2009(1,180K v. 634K)  so shouldn't men be more afraid?	9
0	Best move on then.	9
0	You could contact their HR and see if they still have your information on file. That way you get back into it without having to re-apply.	9
0	Oh no, most of it is douchebaggery. I don't deny that I enjoy being a horrible person, anonymously on the internet.  But that doesn't change the fact that some people worry when their loved ones get fat. I wish my loved ones had expressed concern when I got fat. But I had to figure that out for myself. And I fixed it. And you can, too!   P.s. Why would I be in TrollX if I were a guy? Quit with your misogynist assumptions. Women can hate fat-logic just as much as men.	9
0	Not always, sometimes they get a bunch of responses and go with the "top" ones. I have applied for jobs that someone with no post-high school education could perform but they wanted a bachelors degree on the application(government job, but still). Whoever they selected for interviews obviously weren't making the cut, maybe you'll get picked this time. If you don't oh well, you don't need them. If the company is good it could be worth a second try on your part.	9
0	I love how I get downvoted to hell for posing an alternative, equally valid explanation, giving the guy the benefit of the doubt.  Sometimes this feels more like /r/MisandristsAnonymous than /r/TrollXChromosomes	9
0	Talk away!  Sometimes this is the best therapy!	9
0	If it's any consolation, I can promise you that that sort overtly misogynist behavior is by and large   gone from people educated enough to be engineers. The next generation won't have to worry about that. It's laughed upon now.	9
0	Exactly, and thank you. It surprised me yet showed me the nature of this sub maybe isn't what I remembered.	9
0	THANK YOU. I am afraid we are alone.	9
0	I'm your same age. Why should we need a term for this when men don't?    Men dating/fucking/doing as we do need no distinction, why should we?	9
0	Damn, jump on it!	9
0	That... might just be the best autocorrect I've ever seen.	9
0	So do I! They have some really awesome things you can't get anywhere else.	9
0	It's things like this that's always made me relieved I was straight. So much less relationship drama. My friends liked to play six degrees of sexperation at parties. (My friend group included one or two very complex poly relationships and just about every type of gender and sexual identity and persuasion there could be. Being straight and identifying as your assigned gender was a rarity. I think there were...three of us.)	9
0	Sex is pretty stress relieving, but building up to it can be stressful, yeah. I don't place any value on virginity myself so I don't think that would be a bad way to lose it at all, but I understand if you do and want to save that moment for someone you're really into!	9
0	Ah ok, yeah, that can just kill libido. I hope you get your roommate/finals/other issues worked out soon so you can have fun! &lt;3	9
0	Am I being paranoid or is this post (in the context of the backlash against menstrual cups post earlier today) seem a little bit corporate.   Why are you specifically talking about Divacups and giving very excellent user advice..    /R/hailcorporate	9
0	If you need to vent or whatever. I can listen. Or offer suggestions (if needed). Hope you feel better regardless!	9
0	You done stalking my account by now?	9
0	Do you want to get mauled?  This is how you get mauled.   If you are very lucky and you don't get mauled, immediately wash any part of you that touched any of these animals or their enclosures - don't touch your face or your eyes until you do.   There's no crying in zoology.  Once you get home, wash your clothing.   You'll be glad you did.	9

0	As I said, yes. Out of touch. While the CDC maintains that sexual activity continues to start at ~17 (though I  couldn't find a yearly figure), there are many indicators toward the contrary, like the snapchat leak, the prevalence and use of kik amongst minors (and predators), and other things that don't spring to mind at this hour.   With respect to your experience as a teacher, your sample is too small to be considered wholly accurate, and I have to doubt how much information your students would share with an authority figure that has a direct line to their parents.	9
0	Oh, Fuck me. So funny. Downvote away. If you weren't so rabid I may have forgotten why I even joined reddit. You go, red pill guys, keep being - you. You are making me remember why I joined reddit to begin with. And I have very little to lose, now. Go for it. Bring it.	9
0	Yes, it's the ease and accessibility that's different now. I don't disagree with anything you've said, really. But just because other people double-date doesn't mean it's acceptable to lie (or omit) about sexual activity with others.	9
0	Sorry, I couldn't stand that subreddit long enough to understand it, or its relevance. Also I have no idea how I've been defensive. I reexamine my convictions constantly, which I believe is evident in this thread.   Yes, that was considered, thus the "odds are." Hippies weren't so common.	9
0	It sounds like your dude has a solid foundation to build on. Nicely done	9
0	That's a yellow flag at the least, OP.   Most likely even when he does have sex he'll always think of it as "bad" and "evil" and won't really enjoy it and then you'll end up in /r/DeadBedrooms.	9
0	Also perfect AP style with DivaCup that is their exact branding.	9
0	So.....do you correct her?.......	9
0	Get it? Because most of the marriages have been straight people? Hahaha!!!   But seriously. Being a straight chick and having my boyfriend cheat on me is rough. But being a lesbian and having your lesbian-identifying girlfriend cheat on you? Extra rough, because she's not only on you, she's cheating on lesbianism. Anyone with experience in the LGBTQ scene can tell you it gets incestouous by default. There's only a handful of people in the area to date/sleep with? It gets tricky fast.	9
0	i guess mr. manager hasn't heard about sexual harassment [lawsuits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSxAc8jHBdk).	9
0	Cause it doesn't work here.	9
0	It's a subreddit for jokes and memes, rage comics and gifs.  This post is none of those things.  I totally understand why people are pissed that I said what I said, but to me this post is super boring and belongs somewhere else.  There are more and more of these posts everyday, we are losing the essence of this subreddit.  Go ahead, downvote the shit out of me, I know you want to.	9

0	Look this whole entire shit show of a thread started when I said that. **People are getting more afraid of men now while rates are decreasing.** Not that pepole can't protect them selfs. But that pepole seem to be not just walking on the other side of the road but some women even think you need force all men into class to teach them not to rape.  All I was saying is demonizing pepole is wrong when you get no added gain. But man this board(not you) I'm fucking done with this shit	9
0	&gt;Guys could just not stalk us/creep on us          I think the point was that guys (or anyone really) are NOT stalking/creeping just because they're heading in the same direction as you.	9
0	That's the opposite of what I said?	9
0	But I did say that.	9
0	I'm curious, why you go for FWB and not straight up relationship?  And it's just my personal experience, but in exclusive FWB settings feelings tend to come up eventually, so be careful about that. Either by not being exclusive or setting good groundrules, you could avoid that, though.	9
0	I think it's perfectly fine for the person being "followed" to take whatever precaution they want. At the same time it's utterly ridiculous to expect the "follower" to accommodate the other person in any way whatsoever. No crossing the street. No change of pace. No changing direction. They can if they want to be nice but it shouldn't be an expectation.	9
0	I'm sure you have a better insight on her personal life experiences than she does.	9
0	If it's unhealthy to act like an asshole online then we should probably enact legislation regulating video games and, well, the internet.  What's not healthy is getting your panties in a bunch over anything on the internet.	9

0	How is engineering difficult, may I ask?	9
0	As I've said, I take no issue with women avoiding me for their own safety. I get why it happens and am not offended by it. That doesn't mean I'm going to be 100% okay with it on a personal level. No one is an empathetic altruist all the time.  That was all I was trying to say.	9
0	Ah.    So, because math is hard to some, therefore engineering is totes way hard!    -    Essentially, what it comes down to is   *Engineering is difficult - according to engineers.*    Honestly, not that surprising given their mental capacity (limited) and their emotional capacity (barely existent).    Of course, then again, they're the same imbeciles who immediately brand someone who disagrees with them on the Internet as a "troll"    -   TL;DR:  People shouldn't confuse petty arrogance with intelligence.	9
0	And that's completely fine but it should be no concern at all to the "follower." It's not his or her problem.	9
0	Okay. I'm sorry, but who are you to say what other people should or shouldn't complain about on the Internet? People will complain about fucking everything on the Internet. It's the Internet. It's more our job to not care about illegitimate bullshit complaints.	9
0	I have no one to play with anymore! :(	9

0	I know she was being sarcastic but its *kinda* true. Honestly, if you want to lose weight you really need to look at what you are eating. I highly recommended Fed Up on netflix. Gives you an idea of where you might be going wrong.  Of course, if you are happy with your body then just go with it.	9
0	Just because someone can't love you doesn't mean you are unlovable. They just can't handle all the awesome. Being with someone that likes you shouldn't cause you to feel insecure about yourself, you should feel more confident. It's not your problem, it's his. Does he say he likes you?	9

0	Maybe I don't get the context, and maybe it's because I'm a guy (not a pig, I swear!) but if I am identifying someone I don't know, I would usually use the most obvious feature of the person to describe them. Not in a judgmental way of course, but if a random woman comes to the table for a few seconds and walks away, and she has enormous breasts, I would identify her as "the one with the big boobs"	9

0	If I must spell it out for you, Reddit thinks that engineering is the be-all-end-all of everything.  Despite their dimwittedness, utter lack of humanity, and the fact that their lionized fields of endeavor are not particularly difficult intellectually, they nonetheless insist on flagellating themselves while denigrating women and masturbating to Japanese cartoons all the while proclaiming their superiority.	9
0	Shorter cocks are way easier, right!? Totally agreed. The only thing I really prefer to have in a cock that I have in my mouth (and no I would not point it out if a guy did not have this characteristic, I just enjoy it if it happens) is getting really REALLY stiff and tensed up just as he comes in my mouth. It's one of my fave things, and it really doesn't matter how big it is... so long as it isn't too thick to fit in my mouth (that can be really tricky, I feel sorry for guys who are that big because it must be so awkard too)	9
0	Oh my goodness, really? That's awesome!!	9

0	Always with the comparisons to black people, it's like you guys have something on your mind. If blacks made up half the population, were naturally stronger and taller than you, but had *across the board* in every country and region in the world throughout recorded history, the overwhelming number of sexual assaults, sexual harassment, physical violence, and aggressions to their record, yeah, it'd be a more apt comparison.  Not womens fault society dictates victims share responsibility with their attackers and their attackers are mostly men. But, yeah, good stuff yo.	9
0	For real. Why do dudes spit in public all the time? It's fucking gross. JUST SWALLOW IT.	9
0	Seems like a logical fallacy to me. People who rape are assholes who would rape anyway. Dress codes aren't there to prevent rape, they are there to force women(because really, guys get a bad deal out of this somehow?) to dress conservatively because of administrative heads stuck in the 50's and up their asses.	9
0	I warn men too so, its not something to really get offended about he probably just assumed you were a light eater is all.	9
0	I eat Raisin Bran for breakfast and count that as good enough, I figure the rest will fill in. Also is it just me or does Raisin Bran have too many raisins? Like I love the top where it's just a few, so you get like 1 in each spoonful, but towards the bottom it's like 1 flake and 80 raisins.	9

0	Lets blame cloths, sounds like a good idea, the way a woman dresses totally determines if they get raped or not...Rapists rape, doesn't matter what you wear. To say that wearing spaghetti straps is inciting rape is a logical fallacy.	9
0	(ignoring the situation/boyfriend)  For the most part, I'm attracted to bone structure/body type, rather than clothes or hair or makeup or items on a counter. That stuff all seems kinda extraneous. So... if you're literally covered in horse shit, you could still be hot, just not very desirable at that moment.	9
0	Except in the context of a dress code calling it propagation of a rape culture is wrong. It's being sexist, but it's not promoting a rape culture to tell women they can't wear certain items of clothing on school grounds. It's the same as working in a business, it's sexist but it's not promoting a rape culture to tell them they should dress business casual/formal.	9

0	Last night I had a dream WHERE I BROKE INTO HIS HOUSE TO SAY HI. Luckily, dream me realized this was a bad idea and snuck out before he or his parents noticed me.   I feel creepy and can't figure out why he keeps popping back into my dreams after this many years :/	9
0	People break up every day	9
0	Ohh boy. I'm just so tired of all these star wars.	9
0	How... Does one get a vagina waxed? I can't imagine either the purpose or the method.  The only thing I can come up with is that you think your vagina is part of your vulva, but that doesn't make sense either, since you're obviously literate, etc.	9
0	Always. :) &lt;3	9
0	You wouldn't enjoy having men realize they could look better with makeup and jump on the bandwagon?	9
0	Well, yeah. I understand that one purpose of not shaving can be to deliberately avoid having sex after a night out, but I don't see why it should forbid it in the first place if it's the woman's desire. The joke linked literally only makes sense to me if I stretch it to its opposite meaning.   If anything, I would have assumed that the trollsX I've grown to know for their practical opinion would be of like mind on this, but clearly I was mistaken.	9
0	I have the best luck- my pelvis/hips combo is shaped such that *everything* does this. Kind of makes up for vibrators being worse than useless.	9
0	Any time I'm on a high-progestin pill (which I am currently) it gets much worse. I'm shedding spectacularly.	9
0	*Sigh* I think you might be right. Can't make people listen. Ah well.	9
0	[I mean, not really, but.  it's fine.](https://theconversation.com/no-feminism-is-not-about-choice-40896)	9
0	I get that that happens a lot (from all sexes/genders I might add), *I'm just agianst that it's so assumed that's how it is*. Especially since all we know from that sentence is that the husband doesn't like it, we don't know anything of how often he does it despite not even liking it or if he expects to receive oral himself.	9
0	Im not really down with the whole "eye for an eye" thing, but I can fully support having some self respect.  There is a graceful way to exit most scenarios and simply not associate with those people (which is the best way to handle such things imo)	9
0	Honestly, it doesn't matter if it's a norm socially because it's a standard academically. As I mentioned though, freedom of speech gives everyone the right to impersonate whomever they like, it just doesn't make it true.	9
0	Yeah, that changes things obviously, but the image here doesn't include these details. Yet still people think the husband is a selfish asswipe/agrees with Offerman without those details, that's my point.	9
0	I wouldn't say there's a need to be disrespectful.  You can easily stand up for yourself and respectfully tell someone they're crossing a line and that they need to stop without losing your cool.	9
0	I'm just saying that assumptions either way isn't really helpful in relationship advice imo (or for stereotypes I guess, I really dislike stereotypes), but yeah he was being witty.    I guess I'm not used to this problem as I'm not super into getting oral since it doesn't do much for me most of the time.	9
0	But wait, don't we all use physical descriptors all the time? How is "the one with the big boobs" different from "the one with the black hair/red shoes/purple lipstick/etc.?" If you want to argue that you should never use a physical attribute, than you cannot refer to anyone with anything other than the person's name or perhaps title.	9
0	how about, simply, "The Society of Engineers"	9
0	treat the information like a dick pic: only offer when asked.	9
0	Isn't that how Michael Douglas got throat cancer?	9
0	I think the message is love your own body, you don't need to get plastic surgery to be beautiful. She didn't need it.	9
0	nope. i just don't see the point of injecting gender into places where it shouldn't matter, like a group of people dedicated to advocating their profession.  i see feminism as a subset of egalitarianism, that deals specifically with women's issues.	9
0	That's true, but my point is when you trump politeness over everything else you might lose sight of it.	9
0	I think that's inherently part of it but doesn't negate that it's still a good "subconscious sexist assumptions test."   Consider this scene: A father and son are in a car accident and the father dies on scene. The son is brought to the hospital.  End scene.  Where does your mind go? Does your mind allow the thoughts of 'oh, the mother must be so sad losing her husband and son!' ? Mind does. Point being that the mention of the word "father" can sometimes make you think of the corresponding mother, and not just make you only think of men. It all depends on context.	9
0	Sooo, losing your cool and being disrespectful is how you get people to listen to you?  All these years I've been doing it all wrong.	9
0	I absolutely agree. I'm definitely not meaning to negate the importance of radical feminism. But the end goal should definitely be moving toward gender equality.	9
0	So you're saying typo was a typo?  On that note, what's it called when someone says something wrong intentionally, for effect?	9
0	&gt;My panties are damn after reading that last paragraph.   Those damn panties!	9
0	This is the problem with language right? I mean with context we know what she's trying to say, and she has a valid point. But grammatically she's wrong, since she's both a woman and an engineer.	9
0	i like to imagine that "hairly" is a portmanteau of "fairly hairy."	9
0	Transgender and transsexual are really the same thing, but from a different angle. My sex is transverse from my gender, and my gender is transverse from my sex. We prefer to use the word transgender because it doesn't have the negative and fetishistic connotations that have been attached to the term transsexual.	9
0	Haha, whoops, I had another tab open looking for this one wedding venue for a friend. Well this is almost as embarrassing as the time I accidentally sent a sext to my uber conservative lawyer boss.

0	So wait, do you get like, a special discount? Just have a personal preference? Are much wealthier? Is there any particular reason he doesn't buy them, or does it just work out like that?	9
0	Urgh. All of my feels.	9
0	Get the fuck out :)	9
0	I'm trans and I'm aware of what the words mean. Transgender is an umbrella term for many different types of gender non-conforming people, transsexual is a more specific term for people who medically transition. I understand not wanting to use the word because of connotations, but the word exists and I was pointing out that /u/misfortunatefox's definition was inaccurate. Transgender and transsexual are not the same thing, but all transsexuals are transgender.	9
0	Up and down, top to bottom.. Horizontal is side to side. Or right to left or whatever.	9

0	I'm going to festival with outhouses. Uncomfortable indeed.	9
0	its that very attitude of "fuck you and your expectations" that is taking average Americans nowhere. Your belief in an "individuals first" attitude is leaving people without the manners, looks or skills to function in a profitable workplace and thats why so many "alternative" people have to get alternative type jobs.	9
0	It does! And what a nice surprise top take a break from work! I work inside on a computer all day :(	9
0	Where did it say *anything* about "professional" in this post? It didn't. It's talking about dress codes being applied to girls and not boys. And yes, it's *exactly* this thing that perpetuates rape culture. Read some.	9

0	Oh yeah I was a masseuse for a couple years and I've taught my SO some tricks and he taught me good foot rubs; best reciprocal payouts ever!	9
0	Well, I think saying stuff to strangers and friends differ immensely. I say some pretty horrible shit to my friends because I think it's funny. I don't genuinely really believe that or feel that way, but it's fun to just say things you normally can't in a setting that I know I won't be judged. You don't say the same stuff to a waiter that you would say to your best friend.   You're right. It's still disrespectful, but you keep it inside of a space and you don't let it get out and affect others.	9
0	Whoa, are you talking about me? That doesn't really feel like a fair characterization...	9
0	I think it's standard in military and police, but other than that...	9

0	I had the left ovary removed (apparently it was kindof obliterated by the cyst anyway), and they dissected out the cyst on the right to save me some baby-making ability (thanks guys).   The recovery was rough, BUT mostly because I thought I was going in for key-hole appendectomy and woke up with three keyhole incisions, a laparotomy (open-abdo surgery, like a cesarean scar), and only part of one ovary left. It was pretty scary. The actual surgery stuff isn't too bad. Do you know what kind you'll be having?	9
0	Everything about this post is amazing.    (Minus the cramps.  But they got solved!)	9

0	I've been there.  Again and again.  And it gets so damn exhausting going through it again when you feel like you just dealt with all this shit.  I can't make it any better for you from here but I can say that I care and I support you and this shit will pass away.  It make takes its sweet time to move out of your life but it will.  And in the meantime, you are not alone.  If you need anything, just message and we can talk and get through it all.	9
0	It seems like the bar patron in question was speaking to his friends *about* the server, rather than to the server herself. Wouldn't this make it okay by the standard you just described?	9

0	Stupid for learning that Einstein's wife was a mathematician and Physicist who contributed to his greatest achievement (as they corresponded in writing and spoke of "our" work) if not coauthored it?  Yeah, because anyone else was telling me that.  She was at least a sounding board on the theory of relativity and possibly a coauthor. The money was not just for their kid either.  I'm not googling the rest. But that's pretty worthwhile and, like other great figures in history, there's a huge pushback to anyone pointing out his shortcomings.	9

He was flattered that I had idolized him so much :P	9
0	Telling him that you are not going to appologise for having your feelings sounds perfect to me. I guess you've got to give it all the bit of time to settle (his reaction and the issues you are processing). -*hugs*- to you.	9

0	If you want a more realistic take on this trope I suggest either reading Scott Pilgrim or playing the new d Dragon Age game. There is a character in the game called Sera that you can romance, if you scratch the surface she seems like the typical "ZOMG quirky!!1" character but she has some issues.	9
0	I meant that it was sad that it had to be in past tense, but no one got that	9
0	I made a thread on TwoX and the idea seems to be to do it with her but it seems like a bad idea to me.	9
0	That wouldn't go well for me :/	9
0	Dat gaffi stick, doh.	9
0	&gt;NO! You don't do it with her. Heroin is addictive after just one time usage, so if she even uses it once, she might be screwed up for the rest of her life.  Not quite. There's a time after you've had your first. If you go through this time without getting anymore, then you won't end up addicted. I don't think it's relevant here though because she's determine to crash and burn.	9
0	She's enamored with Grunge, heroin and being a loser. -.- She's a major depressive, determined only to crash and burn. She just didn't have a way to do that until she met him.	9
0	I know, was more of a joke than anything else. I hope things improve though.	9
0	Your little sisters sound adorable. What were you taking btw?	9
0	I think they mean that only if she decides to go ahead anyway, that I should do it with her to make sure she's safe.  &gt;Can you expose her to the effects of heroin in any way?  The problem is, the more I show her it's destructuve, the more she's into it. The more I tell her not to, the more she wants to.	9

0	&gt;there is nothing stopping you (except yourself) from making an anonymous tip to the police or someone at her school (a counselor, perhaps), warning them she is dating someone who is pressuring her to use hard drugs.  She'd likely turn it onto me. "I did it because of my sis" etc. It's a bad idea. I still haven't been processed for vandalism :/	9

0	one can not actively get someone else, an adult (or near adult), out of a relationship without severely restricting their basic rights. especially in the context of being a sister and not a parent. what exactly are you suggesting?	9
0	it's best if no one does it  BUT you doing it with her is better than her boyfriend doing it with her.	9
0	It's an issue with our whole family. She already has one.  She's just looking for her blaze of glory.	9
0	If I was a girl, I would just so my nails while I'm naked. I'm too impatient to wait	9
0	I might have to check out his facebook too, then :-)	9
0	that might work.  then again it is quite likely to drive her away into the arms of her boyfriend, make her depressed and make her shut down.  she would be much better off using gentle persuasion and maintaining open channels of communication.	9
0	Yeah she has a kid so she's a worse decision maker than I am :/	9
0	Yeah, I still think you ask the question, you get a response, you make your own qualified judgment and move on.	9
0	It was exactly the same wording, so idk.	9
0	How did it go detail are you young was it your first in awhile or first ever	9
0	It's going to be amazing. Either you'll see something you love, or you'll be able to start making a list of non-negotiables! Win-win!	9
0	hm, i am assuming you are female,  and generally the term suck it is referring to male genitalia.   if you want your man to suck it, then he would need to find another man.  and you might be upset unless your in an open relationship?	9
0	Wow that shows how tight she has been pulled.	9
0	Yeah, as a guy I've always found it pretty weird too.  Nearest I can figure is that it must be a cultural/regional thing that's been taking off more lately or something. I've really never heard anyone phrase it that way where I'm from.	9
0	So maybe if we downvote her enough times the cops will find her and put her in jail?   I'm not saying that we can actually help her get clean, but if she's actually trying to be honest with herself about what she needs to do and is in denial telling her what we actually think is a better option instead of just ignoring her. I don't know what more you want from me.	9
0	I dont get the downvotes, there is a healthy way to do this in moderation. I use opiods regularly on a recreational level. Really helps me relax and be a better person.	9
0	John Green just keeps trying to write them three-dimensional and keeps screwing up. Alaska was supposed to be a subversion of the MPDG but he didn't do it well enough so everyone just remembers her as a MPDG. So he wrote Paper Towns to make Margo start off as the perfect MPDG and then break it down, but people still see her as the MPDG she starts out as.	9
0	and she wants to use heroin? This is all fucked up, and you should take a deep look at the mirror and realize that her decisions are partly your fault. Get your life together, not for you but for the sake of your sister.	9

0	Don't equate your personal experience to everyone else's. It's you, not the drug.   Edit: lol with the down votes. I don't care, explain yourself instead.	9
0	How is it derogatory? Not saying you should do it but derogatory is a bit harsh for such a little thing	9
0	Yeah...west Texas.	9
0	Holy shit what a graveyard.	9
0	Train Spotting and The Salton Sea cured me of ever wanting to try drugs.	9
0	i don't get what's offensive about it. neither set of terms seems derogatory to me.	9
0	I mean, I don't mind it used as an adjective, which it is. As a noun it's a bit annoying. It's kinda like when someone makes a slight grammar error - annoying, but not overwhelmingly terrible.	9
0	Using male/female is vaguely dehumanizing. "Females" applies equally to women as it would to hens. Woman directly includes "human" as part of its definition.  Mixing the other way around has the same effect applied to men.  Using BOTH female and male is vaguely dehumanizing, but equal, so probably okay (but honestly kinda weird anyway).	9
0	I'm not disputing your point regarding racist language, but are you saying there's similar historical context regarding the use of "females"? I'm not personally aware of institutionalized use of the word females to dehumanize women.	9
0	They allow their males to use keyboards?  (joke, my boyfriend is a writer)	9
0	I'll PM you.  Actually, I won't. It will only hurt you.	9
0	It's even more annoying that it's like "we aren't exactly making fun of her" but they are.  Personally I'd rather trollx be less easy humor but this place is getting less like something I can relate to lately!	9
0	but what actually improves for you if I choose to say "men and women" instead of "men and females"? I feel like the context of how and when they are used matters way more than the specific words themselves.	9
0	Please check out my post above. Do these sentences refer to things?  &gt;     Men are earning significantly more even in female-dominated industries. &gt;     These handsome men were born female. &gt;     Do men have female hormones? &gt;     The rate of domestic assault by women on male partners that is about the same as the rate by men on female partners. &gt;     Although the recession hit men worse, the female unemployment rate is... &gt;     Women With Male Friends Get Laid Way More &gt;  &gt;	9
0	Seriously, I dated women before I got married, and it was *definitely* not easier. In my case it was harder, because apparently I'm attracted to crazy.	9

0	Folks, I thought we TrollXers didn't make fun of other women because of their appearance? :-/  EDIT: NO clue why I got downvoted, but I stand by what I said: We should not make fun of other women because of how they look.

0	Don't worry, we understand. :D	9
0	Is it sexism when a woman slanders men? Am I doing this right?	9
0	That would be a particularly obtuse reading of the sentence. It's certainly not going to be ambiguous in a written context. It could be in speech, but that would require quotes.	9
0	True, that is how the conversation was _supposed_ to be going (which is an _entirely_ different debate altogether), but it seems like everyone took the non sequitur and ran with it. Even though the headline isn't what the main point of the discussion was supposed to be, the man said it on the national news. It cannot be ignored.	9

0	Kinda late (3 months to be exact), but I don't really think this is about the fragile male ego as much as it is someone being mad that their years of practice don't match up to raw talent and some basic knowledge.	9
0	Well of course I could, but that's not the point. I'm not the one making the claim. If they're complaining about it surely they have specific examples that bother them? Also what I asked for was a link to any female streamer who streams mostly boobs with the game in the background and receives consistent donations. Obviously all of that doesn't fit into a title :p	9
0	I had a terrible 25th birthday.  And I didnt have a great few weeks after that.  But I quit my shitty job, knit several hats while binge watching netflix.

0	You are a reasonable person. For a lot, not the man but his money is very welcome.	9

0	Yes, possibly no. It is hazy and there are a lot of interpretations of it. I am not comfortable with what she did but it I am also not comfortable with calling it abuse.	9
0	If you girls think Men shouldnt have the right to Veto a potential abortion of their child too. Then I bilieve a Man should be able to Veto raising a child including financiallsy assisting, if the women forces to have it despite the Mans wishes. 2 way street here. Had a friend who was in a 4 year relationship, his GF ended up getting pregnant and choosing to get an abortion. It wrecked him. Dont get how you guys dont think the man should have any input on it.  Its his child too.	9
0	Make some variation of a conservative statement and watch it plummet within seconds.	9
0	Mostly pointing out another difference between No Doubt and Swift songs. It's the notion of "Uggghh who wont she complain about?"  rather than "shit ive been there man." At least i think. My friend is very passionate about this and im tryna defend and explain her perspective as best i can. Might have missed a couple good points.	9
0	Not everything in the world is "fair". What comes into play when a baby is born is the child's welfare. Not how "fair" it is to the wannabe deadbead dad. Nobody says the potential father shouldn't have *any* input. Just that the input of his dick is the last input he gets. Make a choice, kiddo. (I mean you *seriously* think it should be up to the guy what a woman does with her own body? the fuck is wrong with you?)	9
0	No not at all about the argument, just how condescending your comment was. It was pretty disgusting is all. Least I kept my comment objective and polite.	9
0	I totally agree women are allowed to wear whatever they want and express themselves through fashion in any matter. BUT it's the fucking MET Gala! I think there's a time and place. I expected elegance, not these ratchet couture dress. I was disappointed. I would want to look regal at an event like this. I'd want to turn heads with poise and grace. Maybe a little touch of sexiness ;)	9
0	There's still only so much you can do with a 32B.	9
0	Congrats on having the means to be able to do that. Do you think everyone else has the same resources as you?	9
0	Man, when your actual name is Dom reading or listening to any sort of BDSM conversation is supremely confusing. Especially when you're actively involved and have to figure out if you're being addressed or not at that moment :V	9
0	are porn stars really BAMF Women?	9
0	"fuckboy" is pretty good, I also like "fucktwat" and "dickfuck".	9
0	At the worst it signifies emotional instability, mental problem was the wrong phrase. My point was that the frequent relationships alone were not reason enough to criticize Swift.	9
0	Well, not literally.	9
0	If we don't know why they added the text, we shouldn't judge their motives.  It could just be a thought-provoking juxtaposition.  Edit: Nevermind, I just saw that the first "porn" is in all caps, so it's probably reasonable to assume their motives.	9
0	Porn stars are generally selling a product.  Most people don't even know who those women are without being told.  But the women pictured on the right are selling an image, and that image is shaped every time they go out in public, especially at a publicized event. They're selling an image of unattainable glamor, and their dresses are meant to communicate that.  The revealing nature of their dresses is probably more dictated by the current fashion trends, than the desire to be naked in public.	9
0	It would make it easier to continue the frenzied rolling motion and act as a nice visual indicator for those around you as you put it on! Plus you could decorate it.....hmmm may have to get one myself	9
0	thank mr skeltl for stong bones n calciums or u r an fuccbooi /r/ledootgeneration	9
0	It's something to do with a internet thing.	9
0	Lol for real; when I'm horny I'm not going for the grandma kisses when I'm heading out. I want that tongue tickling my tonsils and those lips fused to mine. I want that shit to be so sloppy and wet it looks like I just ate pussy to completion! Also some fondling of my tits is in order.	9
0	There's not necessarily much ambiguity, but you did have to change the author's word order, which is a corruption of the author's intention.  It might not be huge, but the Oxford comma allows authors to list items in exactly the order they want, leaving their message intact.	9
0	This reminds me of when Conservatives criticize Obama for being a "dividing influence" or "not bringing people together."  It's not Obama's fault you're racist.	9
0	Guys hear that all the time. I heard that I would find a girl and stay when I moved states away a couple years ago.	9
0	So you’re saying that males are the only ones that attempt to game the system to not take responsibility for their own decisions?   I’m sorry but if we’re supposed to “listen and believe” for victims of rape, it goes for both genders.	9
0	ehhh I think it's straight up rape joking. like the origins of the word and everything. it's gross imo and I think people need to use their brains and think of better insults.	9
0	Speaking as someone who likes a little objectification every now and then (FuckTOY is crass enough to startle me, arm-candy is classy)- Please, please, PLEASE don't let this become a thing.  Fuckboy just doesn't sit right with me on an intuitive level. It feels like I should be sporting a baseball cap and a polo shirt, maybe a crew cut. It makes my whole body flinch.  Edit: I suppose I can understand the contempt, but to clarify, I mean *I* like to be objectified on the odd occasion.	9
0	We must live in the same neighborhood lol	9
0	I don't see anything wrong with her. They could easily edit out her piercings and tattoos. They just chose not to since they don't consider this the norm. Well, not everyone looks like Beyonce either.	9
0	I play girl characters all the time. My favorite is space station 13. I play GTA online as a girl. Only thing I've noticed is people send a lot more requests when I'm playing a girl.     On average, most of these kids online are actually pretty nice. Part of gaming is shit talking. If it hurts your feelings, don't play online games. Fucking around is part of the fun.	9
0	Just for the record, I misread the "might" in your original comment. I apologize for that.  I know I am lucky because my family can help a little. That being said, the rest of the help I receive is available to anyone who qualifies.	9
0	Is there any way in which these updates could be tested before uploaded to prod?	9
0	yeah totally. it's a reference to brutal prison rape. people don't like knowing that words mean things beyond what they want them to.	9
0	One of the reasons I love Taylor Swift. Her music is great and she's actually a good person. And a feminist to boot!	9
0	No, it's still shitty. But it makes it not an immediately sexist reaction like 'T Swizzle' assumes.	9
0	I think they still could've done it. Not like they aren't rolling in the dough there.	9
0	I'm not saying they did. I'm just saying they could've put the time in for the editing if they wanted to.	9
0	Why not just fuck him?	9
0	I'm sorry for u	9
0	No no, it's on our property. It hangs over our roof. It would need professional trimming. As far as I know, it is illegal in CA to have oaks trees cut down.	9
0	i get texts like that from female friends all the time. so do women i know.	9
0	SAME. I love my sweet TayTay. Also I'm so glad I'm not the only one that calls her that.	9
0	I feel the same way. I get it from everyone. Especially female friends.	9
0	I've already said I will not engage with your maligning of scientific research (research which states the conclusions are not definitive in the same sourced study you linked). [PsychologyToday]( https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201306/why-women-want-tall-men) did an excellent break down of the research and the effect of height on personal attraction, for anyone serious about this topic.	9
0	But then you spent the next long while discussing it and getting congratulations about it	9
0	They are better than algebra classes~	9
0	You aren't ordering a meal here, these are people.	9
0	A drunk nudist friend recently showed me her nipple piercings. That was a good day.	9
0	Makes me super mad! As someone that uses piercings as a way to express myself and individuality, I totally disagree with Good Morning America. Like previously stated by others, so many people have tattoos and piercings. I didn't realize society wanted us all to look like Beyonce!	9
0	I agree with basically everything you said. I can list off instances where I think some people would deserve a pass, but I don't think either of us are saying there are no exceptions.	9
0	Sorry, I was testing the limits. My roommate is usually a heavy sleeper but this one week we've been staying up till 4am to sleep so this time she got to bed super early and I wanted a quick stress relief but boy did I turn that thing off so quick while she checked her own phone, lol.	9
0	I don't think they were trying to bash you. The point they're making is that everyone experiences things differently. What you experienced using is particular to your own. I know people who smoke weed and it does wonders for them, personally it gives me severe anxiety/paranoia and also triggers my dossociative disorder so I just don't touch it. Drugs aren't bad and science shows that it helps in so many situations. The thing to take away is, it just doesn't work for everyone and that's where things get bad.	9
0	To be honest, given the power differential between men and women in society, I'm ok with a few double standards like this one. I'm a man, if it makes a difference.	9
0	GMA are assholes anyway, they just drip with wasteful nonsense.  I can't even imagine the emotional turmoil though, that is just... fuck that.  Fuck GMA.	9
0	So when women are objectified on the streets or catcalled, it's a disgusting and sexist practice that needs to stop but doing it to men is acceptable?  If you want your position to be taken seriously, you can't have it both ways.	9
0	I remember watching this a while back but can't remember the name- what is it?	9
0	Shame him on facebook.	9
0	Using the word 'emasculated' in a non-ironic way is a quick and easy way to get to No-Date-Land.  Because gendering things is dumb.  One gender doesn't get exclusive province over good things like paying for people.	9
0	Once in a while I remove the muffler on my Yamaha FZ6R and straight-pipe it along the road, bouncing the rev limiter, I live in the country though so I guess that makes a difference.	9
0	Most definitely, with all these Aldi brands. Or Austria or Switzerland.	9
0	I've sorta done this in that I needed to stay up all night, and one of my activities to pass the time was chatting on Tinder, so I'd be like "you need to entertain me so that I stay awake".	9
0	I guess, I also shoot cans from my porch which I imagine wouldn't go over well in a suburb.	9
0	Thank you. I try.	9
0	She is a human being and as far as I know, we vary in looks quite a lot. They are fucktwats for cancelling her based on appearance.	9
0	nah, i think i'll browse as i want, thanks.	9
0	Why would it be different?	9
0	Because I am right? And people keep arguing shit I'm not talking about? Like now? I'm not arguing a complicated concept, here. You're the one trying to turn it into something else.	9
0	&gt; without giving the impression that I'm an MRA/misogynist/anti-feminist/etc.  What's wrong with the first and last things? Granted, I'm not particularly MRA nor particularly a feminist or anti-fem, they are all just opinions.	9
0	Holy shit, don't you have any friends?	9
0	Pay me enough to afford my own tampons? I care more about OT, benefits, and flex time than tampons.   Congrats if you got benefits, flex time and good pay in addition to tampons lady! :)	9
0	Or create yourself a female-beard account.	9
0	Yup. I love it when people won't take accountability for their own hypocrisy	9
0	But it's the woman's choice it exists.	9
0	I love comedic trollx but its extremely frustraiting when good topics of conversation come up here but we csnt discuss them and get the line "this isnt the place to talk about it" or "your not the intended audience" well when hell else do we get topics like this brought up to discuss these things?  So more often than not we just keep our mouths shut	9
0	... Then why is period sex a thing? If anything, people get grossed out by your bloody dick.	9
0	dont go on tinder if you dont wan't half assed pickup lines	9
0	Don't kid yourself.  ALL men watch boobs.  I'm watching three pairs of boobs as I'm typing this - one on my screen, the blonde sitting to my left on the bus, and that sweet grandmother that's just ahead of me. Peripheral vision is the best.	9
0	Your last comment is incredibly stupid.	9
0	a lot of people swipe right for everyone, then sort later	9
0	You wouldn't need to copy/paste to describe what the argument actually is.  However, had you done so that would open it up to somebody disagreeing.  Just saying "problematic" amounts to a drive-by.  Example:  "Check out this article regarding how people seeking sexual attention are actually adapting their own preferences to suit the desires of their oppressors."	9
0	You look great in both, but I don't see a change.	9
0	not when youre just getting your dick wet... which is exactly why you would use tinder	9
0	Try a little fucking compassion. We all know exactly how this girl feels. Why would an evolved fellow woman feel the need to treat her like shit for it? Be a buddy, not a snot.	9
0	[heheheh](https://i.imgur.com/wjANVCD.jpg)	9
0	&gt;I figured a disclaimer of NOTALLMEN was unnecessary.  Entitlement and hypocrisy at its finest. Carry on.	9
0	I know you're not male based on your username. I'm just not taking you seriously.	9
0	Yeah, or we could respond with kindness and then reach out to the 'loved one' in question to make sure they're okay.   Read some Brene Brown. Shame is not a fucking answer dude.	9
0	Wow, you trollers seem like a repressed lot. Must suck to have to constantly question whether your sexual thoughts are "appropriate" or not. Because sexual attraction is bad! /s	9
0	[Uh huh...](https://i.imgur.com/eZ6QqFn.gifv)	9
0	Do you use a foundation darker than your skin tone? It could be that you look pale, like people do when they get sick, without it. Either that or it's just people noticing a difference.	9
0	I guess that kind of depends on how you define 'date like an adult'	9
0	It's called hypocrisy. People only care about feminism and gender inequality when it negatively impacts them.	9
0	For me was awful to watch, I was too self aware of what was going on. My 2 year old daughter was actually scared when the beast yells at belle and start throwing things around, my jaw couldn't stop dropping.	9
0	This is why I don't watch the news or put too much stock in the things the big media has to say. They're all biased, and they add very little value to the lives of the people.  Your friend is are cute af, and a different, more authentic news source that doesn't cater to 75 year olds would have been better for her anyways.	9
0	I have a real hard time feeling sorry for your social conditioning.  I think I'd rather feel sorry for the women whose expense it's at.	9
0	When she was a very little girl, was it not? Do we normally condemn children for harming other children?	9
0	I can't view short guys as charismatic.  I can't take them seriously and sometimes just seeing them makes me angry for some reason	9
0	I do feel that this is a pretty hasty generalisation as plenty of guys treat women well	9
0	programmers dont deal with the general public	9
0	how good are you at picking up a cute guy you find?	9
0	Actually I'm a bot.	9
0	There any chance you're in the Omaha area, because you're a lady after my own heart	9
0	Yes, only rebrand it: "to catch a creeper" or "to catch a troll" and go form there.	9
0	But, what if a girl really wanted to do this?	9
0	I would love nothing more than to find a woman who I could take to a nice restaurant, have a nice meal, and chat the whole time. Cocktails to follow. And I would certainly call her back the next day.	9
0	A few decades ago "how it was" was for all women to be wives and nothing more. A hundred+ years ago "how it was" was slavery. Just because it's "how it is" doesn't mean we have to accept it. It's up to us to change what's unfair.	9
0	It "rained" a little today! But yeah, this tree has put me off having trees at my imaginary white picket fence future home.	9
0	"You" makes it seem very accusatory, but when you specify that, it makes more sense	9
0	If you're convinced to be an MRA because one woman who also happens to be a feminist doesn't put up with your bullshit, I've got bad (or good, depending on your view) news for you; you're already two feet in that hole. I'm done with you as well; there's far less toxic people worth reasoning with.	9
0	&gt; actually trying to shame other people for knowing their boyfriend  So much projection that it completely invalidates the rest of your point. Sorry, not sorry.	9
0	Be strong little buddy :)	9
0	Turns out I lied! [It was a ShowerThought](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/3561mc/if_there_was_a_female_only_version_of_reddit_the/)  And I think I got it. Like whoa this is revolutionary.  *What if* we don't judge people for feeling fulfilled in dedicating themselves to taking care of someone?  Like, are we really helping someone who wants to be in that position by telling them it's a bad position to be in?	9
0	I know I just get so axcited	9
0	If I am not mistaken, Mjolnir is the hammer not the dude. You're talking about Thor Odenson.	9
0	This! I was first introduced to this kind of sexism from Beauty and the Beast, and once I learned how to notice it I started to freak the hell out. Now I can barely watch tv and movies anymore because of how much sexism there is. It's literally all over the place! (example: look up the Bechdel test, it's surprising how many movies don't pass it)	9
0	Equating people to sexual objects is mean, mmmkay?	9
0	Looks like eyeliner on the right	9
0	Are you guys in high school? Expect to hear a lot of obnoxious things like this until you're in your mid twenties.	9
0	I understand that feeling all too well.  (BTW you can totally still see your friend's name)	9
0	I respect your opinion but I think we don't share it.   You're right, he needed to change in order to find love,  and he did.  But come on the part when she saves him from the pack of wolves back in the castle he blames her for the attack, whaaaat?   then he tells her that the library is all for her *if* she stays, umm OK.	9
0	I have been in that position. I thought very carefully about it and did what needed to be done.	9
0	My guess is a dye job, but the lighting is so different between the two pictures that I'm not sure.  EDIT: Or did you get it cut? It looks shorter on the left. Which one is the before picture? I'M SO CONFUSED	9
0	Ah yes... The PS4 one of the most powerful gaming systems on the market.	9
0	I may have really pissed off a few of my friends by referring to is as "50 Shades of Grey for kids."	9
0	it is literally a prison slang term for rape victim.	9
0	So brave, that will teach him...	9
0	Yeah, it's the same thing. It's not creepy because he's a millionaire/prince.	9
0	When I watched the first time Beauty and the Beast as an adult all I realized was Stockholm syndrome and [this](http://cdn.themetapicture.com/media/cool-Disney-Gaston-Beauty-Beast.jpg)	9
0	Yeah, that's not so cool.	9
0	kinda sucks that you're so wrapped up in the importance of age.  Statistically speaking there are any number of guys younger or older than you that could make you happy.  so you're 26 - what's wrong with a great 21 year old?	9
0	Yup, I blame this movie for my first terrible relationship. It wasn't abusive, but it was very unhealthy and absolutely terrible for me. Turns out it's his favorite Disney movie, too, and he thinks it's SUPER romantic.	9
0	wow your so hip and cool. look at you go.	9
0	To me it seemed like her means of doing this were only worth while when she had a boy to follow.	9
0	yeah, i always bring my long bow.	9
0	I think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uuk-h2ZYNJU) sums it up pretty well.	9
0	I agree. He kept her captive - you stay or your dad stays is not exactly her freely deciding to be there. And he was cruel and scary etc.   Ugh ugh ugh everything about it	9
0	Aladdin is literally the worst. :(	9
0	He's right to have all his issues and be angry and all that, but that doesn't give him the right to yell at belle is not her fault.   Yes, it's her choice to stay with him that's what's shocking,  I mean the guy verbally abuse you and still stays with him even though he let you go.  Mmh I don't think so.   my opinion :)	9
0	I mean, yeah. Women shouldn't be asked to be entertaining. THat's the man's job. pardon me if i sounded like im complaining.	9
0	She looks great. Wtf.	9
0	Alright internet...pick up the pitchforks, lets make Good Morning America regret this and let news agencies know that it's not okay to discriminate against people who look different.	9
0	He hasn't gone down on you at all?	9
0	Nah sorry but fuck that noise. You've gotta take some responsibility. I dated a guy for awhile who had some real demons from his past he refused to face. And he's a dick. I've tried for a long time to try to help him, and fix him, and just "be there" because he's hurting and he "can't help it" because he's damaged. I mean I get it, I didn't have the most pleasant childhood.. it took years of therapy to heal from my shit. But when I realized I was an asshole and hurting everyone around me, I did something about it.	9
0	&gt; 2) Because if I was your friend and single there would be little cartoon hearts around my head looking at that post.  lmao. what a way to breed white knights	9
0	Clearly they don't know ...not to piss off the ~internet~!	9
0	Yeah! Come home from your job and then help her do half of hers!	9
0	&gt;It completely sucks because it keeps perpetuating the attitude that judging others for their appearance is okay.   welcome to the entire shit-tastic concept of "professionalism"	9
0	I do this all the time with Tupperware that's been in the fridge for years.	9
0	Does it tickle?  I've never grown mine out that long (weirdly - I started shaving it as soon as it appeared) so I have no idea what it would even feel like.   Does it smell any different? Is applying deodorant functionally different, or does it smear on your clothes more? Is it itchy?   I'm kind of curious and thinking about letting it go just to see what happens.	9
0	More info: he's struggled with depression for longer than I've known him. A lot of shitty stuff has happened to him lately, and now he's had to drop out of school when he should be graduating. I'm so frustrated for him, and I wanna fight for him but there's nothing I can do. I get worried for him sometimes. Also he's my ex, so there are complex feels all around.	9
0	I'm confused. Are you saying mansplaining isn't a bad thing to say? I find it irritating. I'm not bringing up your ovaries in the conversation, no reason to bring up by balls. If girls do this, they should expect tit for tat. :/	9
0	It isn't. Law is just as tied up in petty disputes as anything else.	9
0	Good thing he doesn't know that deleted  snapchat pictures are retrievable	9
0	Of all the people on this with an agenda, I have the least agenda. You kids literally walk around real life trying to instill feminist values. im just following links on reddit, leaving innocuous comments and getting your panties in a bunch effortlessly.  if you weren't such lowlifes, it;d be fun	9
0	I get the feeling that I'm dealing with very young people here apparently.	9
0	&gt; well... the only reason you'd be okay with that is if you have very misguided opinions on feminism  Clearly. I'm in Japan and I met a Chinese communist who claimed the same thing about me not liking communism. Its a great thing in theory, but I'd rather not get involved with it in practice.  &gt;The MRA movement tends to devolve into misogyny  People claim the same about feminists. Only feminism claims to be far flung, so they can dismiss those elements.	9
0	It came out when I was six.  I was terrified of that movie for years.	9
0	I could say the same about anti-feminism. Only i have a life.  That seems to be the difference in SJWs and nons.	9
0	Man, I realized this as a kid, and always hated the movie. I never understood, even as a child, why she fell in love with him. I guess I wouldn't have even stuck around long enough to realize he's a great person haha. At the first sign of his anger issues I'd have fucking booked it LOL	9
0	Not really. Social housing doesn't need to be state owned, and neither does the health system. As long as it's state *funded*. I live in Australia and most of our health system is privately owned, it works better than the NHS.  If you want a more apples to apples comparison, the NHS in England is more market-oriented than in Scotland or Wales, and it works better there than in the other two.	9
0	Maybe that's because when you don't wrap it in theocratic bigotry like the Republicans do, it works.	9
0	Neoliberalism is a political and economic ideology inspired by classical liberal economists and in particular those of the Austrian school. It was later reformed, remodeled, and modified by the Chicago School of economic thought, including Milton Friedman and Peter Laffer. Neoliberalism, generally, states that government intervention in the operation of the free market and the forces of supply and demand are not only useless but actively counterproductive, doomed not only to failure but to actively hinder market efficiency by artificially distorting "natural" economic patterns. Neoliberalism thus believes that state intervention in the economy should be kept to a minimum, and that redistributive and other such measures violate market independence and sometimes natural rights.	9
0	Well, they said he had a strong campaign performance as leader, which isn't quite the same thing.   Christ, what a spot for labour. Can't appeal to Nationalists because UKIP and the SNP are eating their lunch, can't appear to the White Van Man because they still get painted as elitist, can't appeal to middle and upper classes because they're not taxy-cutty enough... I'm not extremely knowledgeable about British Party Politics, but Imma go ahead and blame Blair for abandoning the idea of a Labour party being for workers, and they've never recovered.	9
0	Cant have anybody choosing that lifestyle now can we? Women's Rights. Well except to choose a domestic role ecause that's subservient!	9
0	Totally possible. With context it might be a witty remark to a sexual thing he said, but since the only context it has is that he was devastated, it's seems like it's just an insult in meme form, hence - mean.  EDIT: I also somewhat doubt anyone would claim it wasn't mean if it was about a man saying stuff like that. Fuck it people say mean things during a breakup, it happens, doesn't make them horrible people, but doesn't make the stuff they say nice either.	9
0	I don't think I could be friends with someone who sneezed like that	9
0	i live in perpetual fear of failure and disappointing those around me, so much that it's given me an anxiety disorder.   I wish I could help you. Sometimes we just have to let ourselves off the hook.	9
0	Thank you for salvaging this movie for me!	9
0	Sometimes, yes. People don't come out of high school as fully formed adults with a mature understanding of the world. Obviously not true in all cases, but people get a lot less malicious in every respect as they age, including homophobia.   At least this is what I've seen from millenials.	9
0	*kneeling on the ground and raising my hands up high*  Nooooo~!!!	9
0	&gt; But then again, blame FPTP.  You wanted a Conservative/UKIP coalition then?	9
0	I agree with you 100%. One thing that always bothered me was his "It's forbidden!" response to "What's in the West Wing?" If he had said, "Those are my private quarters," or something like that, Belle would have respected his wishes and not been curious at all.	9
0	I think in some of the stories, stockholm is a lot more plausible (most of the stories have a lot less sentient furniture).	9
0	Well. Can't read well.	9
0	Congratulations! Your doing fine.	9
0	My response would've been to be internally grossed-out and externally to be like, "sorry, but I'm gonna need you to reprint this assignment you just sneezed all over"...	9
0	lol what i just sited multiple sources.... normally when someone tells me im doing something fucked up and wrong, i stop doing it. why not err on the side of caution instead of flippant rape joking. cool, ladies. way to disrespect rape victims in a whole new way.	9
0	They're peasants, albeit cleaner ones that had the good fortune to work in the castle and not toil in the fields.  Guess that turned on them.	9
0	Maybe you shouldn't include your Instagram username for everyone to see.	9
0	Someone mentioned maybe objects not aging out of kindness to them, which makes some sense.  But the teacups still act like children.  If they were turned as young kids, they spent 10 years not aging cognitively at all?  Another option is that they are literally frozen in time until a human enters the walls, which would further isolate Beast.  I'll have to rewatch to figure out if that makes sense.	9
0	But why? It's not hurting anybody.	9
0	It only bothers you because its true.	9
0	you can get a set of 25 pieces at walmart for $10 so I see no problem with a yearly new set. Though I tend to lose tupperwear more than toss it out because of it's grossness.	9
0	I couldn't do that to my husband.  My BO has the pungent tang of an old farmer who hasn't watched his favorite shirt for a few weeks.  It's the *worst*.  Also, GO NATS!!!	9
0	Cool.  Call that something else, because you're confusing the hell out of everybody else.  [The word "neoliberalism" doesn't appear anywhere in this Wikipedia article, for instance.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_school_of_economics)	9
0	Right? I mean, if you're gonna play along with that spinster attached to pets stereotype, why have an obsession with a creature who shows, at most, indifference towards their owners and acts more like an autistic child than an animal that can respond well to human emotions.    I'm gonna put up my flame shield now...	9
0	I admittedly have more of a "cat" like personality so why I on earth would I want to hang out with a creature that behaves in similar fashion?! That'd be torture. I hate what I am!1!  Bring on the doofy dogs.	9
0	Professionalism is one of the labels applied to what I'm referring to, but it isn't the overall concept.  An extreme and obvious example would be employees at Disneyland.  Each area of the park has a different uniform because each area has a certain type of visual language, and the employees are just as much a part of maintaining that visual as the architecture of each building.  It would be jarring to see someone dressed in old timey western clothes helping you to your seat on the Star Wars ride.  Not because that employee is being unprofessional, but because their appearance is detracting from the intended experience.	9
0	But he just said that he did.	9
0	The jerks are the loudest. The people that you change their minds aren't typically going to say anything, but it has an impact. Even the jerks are listening sometimes.	9
0	Lee Lin Chin used to just present the SBS news, but then I don't know if she stepped away or they replaced her. But now she's on The Feed and just kind of hilarious awesome.	9
0	Never discuss politics or religion in the workplace.	9
0	It's ok to objectify female models and other people being hired for sex appeal? Funny saying that amid hundreds of posts in this damn subreddit saying how gross it is to do such a thing	9
0	Yeah I really don't understand what's so awesome about anal. Because poop. : / Anal is just scary	9
0	The people that don't grow out of their dumb get worse, it's true.	9
0	Happy cakeday, dude.	9
0	I'm willing to bet a lot of money that the ratio of affectionate,responsive cats to indifferent, stand-offish cats is much much lower than what you find with dogs. I've encountered plenty of cats and dogs over the years and I can always count on most of the dogs to respond favorably to me. I only bad mouth cats when I feel it's relevant to whatever is being discussed. Not like I do it out of the blue...give me credit for that atleast!	9
0	I knew, **at every loan**, what my additional payments would be (and the total, and how to mediate or defer them).  Plus what my earnings potential was.  Seriously (no sarcasm), why is it a surprise?	9
0	I see pictures of her wearing a sherwani, and pictures of her pairing  scarves in traditional Indian styles with business tops and blazers. Were you expecting something else?	9
0	Yeah... there are several possible explanations for that. I suppose the most benign of them is that he is a twin himself and finally has someone who understands the weirdness that comes with being a twin.  Far more likely is that he thinks if he scores with you, it's like he got to see two women naked.	9
0	I don't think it would be a good idea :/  With my family history of cardio-vascular problems and my personal migraine history, I'll steer clear of the actual blue pill until they develop something similar yet not as blood pumpingly harsh for women	9
0	your eating food, that could be used to feed me so your saying it is ok for me to yell at you to protect my life!	9
0	There's a reason why the word "catty" is used to describe difficult, unfriendly people. Just saying....	9
0	I haven't seen that movie in years. I've seen a child's temper tantrum in a 33-year-old man, which is not pretty.	9
0	Would that real life works as it does in the movies.	9
0	I don't know. It's been years since I've seen it. I was talking about general life.	9
0	Where did I, in any way, imply that the creeper has no responsibility? Do we always have to explicitly state this? Of course it's his fault. However, this doesn't detract from the fact that having personal information in a public space can lead to this, even though it shouldn't.   I will rephrase what I said, if you want: In the future, OP should consider hiding this information on Tinder to prevent another incident like this from happening. She could always disclose to someone with whom she feels comfortable.	9
0	I had one sub who liked to bite.  She was certainly a brat.  It was nowhere near how hard I've been known to bite though.	9

0	Simple passive-aggressive quips don't help anything.	9
0	I hate Iris for being bitchy about everything, I love Caitlin because she's awesome. As for Arrow, I can't stand Laurel, I really like Felicity, but don't like the whole 'Olicity' thing.  Tatsu and Nyssa are pretty cool. OP do you watch Agents of S.H.E.I.L.D? I actually really like how women are portrayed in that versus the DC shows. I need to watch Agent Carter too.	9
0	No offense taken. And I apologize if I came off as rude.   Perhaps I was raised this way, but, to me, you just simply avoid putting *anything* personal or intimate on the internet wherever strangers can see it. That's why it immediately came to mind, along with the fact that it would, in the future, prevent another incident .	9
0	First time I'm seeing her, but based on this sample of tweets she sounds self-important. Is there something I'm missing? Calling people plebs, telling (via tweet...) that what she posted is none of people's business... why bother with social media at all?	9
0	You are such a piece of shit.	9
0	I'm curious what 'age-appropriate' means? OP isn't a minor. I don't think I can get behind judging people that choose to date because they have a large difference in age.  Having an age preference is fine, it's like having any other dating preference. But if OP or anyone gets to say their *their* preference is people close to their age, this dude gets to have *his* preference of dating someone younger.	9
0	I'm a guy.	9
0	The old "Age/2+7" rule checks out to me.	9
0	I'm just so confused what OP was thinking they'd see. Her in saris? Bollywood outfits?	9
0	"...that successfully merges two cultures **BUT** when I image search..." OP seems surprised at the results, I don't really understand why. That's all.	9
0	Ok what exactly did I say in that paragraph that pissed you off? This is what makes people shy Tories. Because they are vilified by left leaning people who either don't listen who buy into to the shit about right wing people being heartless bastards who are rich, so they don't reveal that they are Tory because the left wing voters are so annoying about it.	9
0	At least it could always be worse.  You could be disabled in Texas.  :(	9
0	I personally dont disrespect people, and if I find myself in situations causing me to lose my cool then that means I should rethink subjecting itself to those situations.	9
0	Is it still a conversation if nobody understands each other?	9
0	It's no lie, she really is. She's where I got my sass from.	9
0	So you need to validate yourself by thinking it's a matter of "earning"  a cat's attention?	9
0	As a guy, my initial  reaction is almost always going to be this. I'd probably  be able to keep it to myself, but the hesitation will be there and you'll know and everyone loses.	9
0	Like I said, maybe onlinr dating isnt for her. It wasnt for me, and Im better off for leaving it behind. Plenty of fish in the sea, and plenty of happiness even alone without one.	9
0	You want to drink Baileys from a shoe?	9
0	There used to be safe spaces for women. Ladies went about their business and me went about theirs seperately. Something got screwed up in the implementations of progressive gender ideals.	9
0	Why would you even try and get high off of anxiety meds? Mine just makes me sleepy, gives me migraines, and make my throat hurt if I take too many in a short time span and even sometimes when I only take one of them. Luckily they're prescribed to be taken when I'm getting really anxious rather than three times a day that was prescribed when I first got them.	9
0	Want to see my vagina? That's right, Old Greg's got a mangina!	9
0	Other than to take pride in not being /popular/ in that sense..I would say being catty is the way to go, especially if there are actual cats.	9

0	My snapchat got REAL WEIRD tonight. Me and my eyeliner and my wine.	9
0	Why would you not want to take care of your personal hygiene to make your partner happier?  Shaving your nipples literally takes 10 seconds, and you only have to do it once in a while.	9
0	Thank you its been a long night, I appreciate it.	9
0	I'm amazed and appalled at the same time when people just casually mention mutilating their ~~toy-animals~~ pets to better fit into their ~~prison~~ household.   I misread /u/Stellaaahhhh's comment. I read declawing... I'm sorry.	9
0	This is why I always say "vagina".	9

0	You couldn't even be mad at that. What a gorgeous pic. :)	9
0	Are you bigger on the inside?	9
0	Guy here.   You're new so, he could just be messing with you. Maybe he doesn't like working with you because you're annoying to him. And he hopes by being rude you'll just leave him alone.   Really at a job site like this it could be anything. I used to work construction and a few guys messed with me for being the young buck. It just goes with the territory.   That being said if you were to go to management with this I wouldn't want to work with you also. There is just something about "telling" that really pisses  me off.	9

0	Unless it featured a skeletal pasty ass white guy with a beard and a penchant for sarcasm a mile wide, getting dumped by his fiancee at the altar and then sent back to South Africa by INS, after many a wild adventure in Arkansas, I don't think so...  Granted the whole thing could be made into a very black comedy on Netflix.  It's been almost 6 years and he's still not over it.	9

0	So you don't speak Xhoisan? Aww, man.   Well next time someone says that, you tell them they also speak clicky languages in Yemen so they should ask the next Arab guy they see.	9
0	That's actually impressive.	9
0	I agree. I just don't understand.	9
0	I'm going to take the unpopular view to seemingly the entirety of reddit and say the Tories aren't that bad. It is not the apocalypse, they won by in the end a large margin and people just have to accept that more people in this country think something different to them	9
0	I hope your date went well and you are ok and dealing with whatever self esteem stuff is happening for you. Wishing a nice weekend to all.	9
0	I got bitched at from my FWB cuz she told me the same thing. I felt some feelings too but I wanted to respect her so I said ok. Later I told her and she told me that I should've kept going.	9
0	If it's only one direction, how do you poop?	9
0	Naw, because taking pics of strangers w/out their permission is really weird and not all that okay.	9
0	You can't hate those other things and then not dislike this because you are tired of disliking things. A sob story is worth more than a pretty face.	9
0	I know but you can still be tricked into giving pizza.	9
0	I'm glad this happened. Faith in humanity slightly restored.	9
0	That is true, yes, and I didn't wish to belittle her feelings.	9
0	Haha thank you. Too bad I'm a terrible writer. But you're right. As sad and confused as I am, I'm trying to just channel my frustration into fixing myself.	9
0	What does this mean? D:	9
0	Haha, that sounds like a fun way to get to the point of having sex with a bra on.	9

0	My best friend just asked me for recommendations for introducing her boyfriend to fanfiction. I'm pretty sure between the two of us, we have him convinced that all of fanfiction is nothing but smut. Oops...	9
0	That's an arm punchin'	9
0	eeviee.tumblr.com I think, I'll edit the link later if I misspelled it. She writes Dragon Age fanfics. :)	9
0	The worst thing is that it could have been driven in worse conditions but yet it wasn't which makes me real swoll. I am really glad that I've experienced this kind of stuff live and therefore reinforced the thought process of humanity. This shit's fuckin great. Good on ya by being truthful and performing the right act.	9
0	Not all of it is... Just the really really really awesome stuff is. ;)  Just kidding! But seriously I had him read two that didn't have smut (they were the two I knew he'd like the most) and then I'll ease him into the smutty stuff she writes. What fanfic do you all read?	9
0	... His comment wasn't offensive. If you don't want people to message you, don't go on Tinder.	9
0	Ours does it only with dogs too because the space they do it in is an outdoor grassy area so I think they just don't want cats possibly escaping, since they're *typically* not the kind of pet you put on a leash.	9
0	We both read a mix of Harry Potter and Marvel stuff. I tend to read longer stories with more plot with some shorter smutty fics thrown in, while as far as I can tell, all she reads is smutty one-shots. :P	9

0	For me it sounds like a great way to end up vomiting everywhere lol	9
0	I don't feel like it's a fair comparison because of the uneven balance of power that (unfortunately) exists between the sexes in western society. Example: http://sealpress.com/books/hes-a-stud-shes-a-slut-and-49-other-double-standards-every-woman-should-know/	9
0	Oh you clearly don't know me ahaha	9
0	I think that link might not be right. I've never personally ventured into DA fan fiction but consider me intrigued.	9
0	I never said I was a doctor... And it's still just a hypothesis. Also, several don't even acknowledge oxytocin as a bonding hormone at all, so I'm not sure where you got that. There is as much evidence that it is a stress hormone as there is that it is a bonding hormone, so that's a pretty big deal. Either way, I don't buy that hormones override free will in human relationships.	9
0	Wow that guy is full of shit.	9
0	Where does it say show me boob for pizza?   This looks like being used for pizza, not being tricked. And I'm against it. But used and tricked are not the same. The guy is using her as well and paying pizza for boobs is a pretty low price.	9
0	Indeed. I'd buy it for you.	9
0	It's *Xhosa.  And also, WTF are you going on about?	9
0	I really love you all. (hugs) ^^And ^^also ^^grabs ^^the ^^wine ^^and ^^goodies	9
0	&gt;You are using your sexuality for something. It is like saying "I'm attractive, give me things." Sex and sexuality shouldn't be a tool, or a means to an end.   I disagree. Do you believe that strippers or prostitutes should be looked down upon because of the details of their jobs? Because people can have sex or be sexy for a multitude of reasons, with a multitude of outcomes.	9
0	There's a huge line between "harassing women on the internet" and commenting on a picture. If you think any criticism is harassment, you need to take a look at yourself. I wasn't abusive and I wasn't rude.   As an answer to your question, abstaining from commenting here, askmen, askwomen, and other communities is what I'll be doing. Everyone here and at the other communities are negative, cynical, and don't foster positive thinking. It's easy to get caught in a cycle of negative though when you're on Reddit.	9
0	I would try this if i could eat pizza &gt;.&lt;	9
0	What? Where the hell are you traveling?	9
0	I understand a few of those words.	9
0	Well I'll PM you the correct link when I get to a computer. Her AUs and regular fanfics are just so good that I can't help but brag about her whenever I can. She's a new writer too so I feel the praise will help her realize just how good she is.	9
0	No. You left off the apostrophe and the E.	9
0	Thanks for taking the time to look around for sources at least &lt;3! That was nice of you.	9
0	If you are using something with some sort of free will, then there is always a trick, even with good intentions. There is a saying that we are not "tools". If you tell any of these guys on Tinder why they gave pizza I am willing to bet that 100% will say they want something from the girl.	9
0	they don't get it. you are just happy a hot guy is too stupid and has too low standards and that can benefit you in some way however you look at it. i get it and it's not a big deal. it's kinda nice to experience	9
0	"You know that hole that's designed specifically for sex? I'm not going to use that one today, I'm going to try the other one. You know, the one where all the poop comes out of."	9
0	Allergic to cheese? :(	9
0	I'd use "boy toy" over "faux bae." The latter sounds too young for me. But do what you want. :)	9
0	He sounds like all of the fun!	9
0	I didn't mind the original caption! :D	9
0	I agree, he was completely using that line to hit on her and nothing else. Also he's kind of negging on Black Widow "they are just as badass as" like he thinks they can't be more badass. He played this girl.	9
0	I'm sorry you got downvoted, I agree with you.   I don't think his message was wrong, it was a compliment.	9
0	and why did you put the screenshot here for people to make fun of him?   I guess if you are on Tinder, you are looking for someone. I know, people message you all kind of things, but I don't think his message was bad, I think the whole thing was quite nice, the only thing is your comeback... it is quite ... not rude, but *hard* - like you are not interested or that you are offended by his message.	9
0	I'm not really into cuddles anyway. My FWB is and it kind of freaks me out, cause I don't think of him in any cuddly kind of way, but even when I just let the spooning happen... I dunno, I just disconnect the entire thing from my emotions I guess.	9
0	You're focusing on cuddling when it's just one little example of what can make a FWB thing complicated. And anyway, it doesn't have to be a big deal if it happens. A FWB is a friendship above all else to me. Disconnecting it from emotions and intimacy sort sounds...strange and unhealthy. Like you're (general you) afraid that anything else beyond fucking will make it a scary relationship thing.	9
0	It was weird for me too. Definitely one of those 'do not relate' types of posts.	9
0	Really? Not one regret?	9
0	I posted [this](http://imgur.com/2z66xxM) on my Twitter and it began making rounds on Reddit. Seriously, fuck this site (except trollx of course).	9
0	Not the world, just half of it.  [My attitude towards it.](http://imgur.com/2z66xxM)	9
0	Nope. Just no more female oppression.	9
0	I don't think we can take his word on it with respect to the substance abuse.	9
0	Lol that's what happened to me too. phase 1: stumble upon reddit. phase 2: reddit merrily. phase 3: have feelings hurt by buttfaced misogynists. phase 4: give finger to 90% of reddit and retreat into safe, female-oriented places like trollx.	9
0	We live in a society where a woman makes a fraction of what a man makes, where 1 in 4 women are raped, where a woman has no free will over her body and where women are actively discouraged from going into fields like STEM, so, yeah, a little "domination" wouldn't be that bad.	9
0	&gt; a very aggressive approach to feminism that isn't really going to do any good  Men have been the aggressors and women have been the victims for the major part of history. That's not going to change if women don't put on an aggressive front to stop the oppression and dismantle the patriarchy.	9
0	I can quite tell. I didn't come here for a lesson in the intricacies of languages though.	9
0	This image creeps me out. Does it really seem like a good thing to view yourself as a dictator? Theres such a negative and patronizing connotation to that word IMO. I understand The importance of autonomy but an absolute refusal to allow anyone make any input into how you conduct yourself seems like a dangerous perspective to lock yourself into.	9
0	I'm a guy that is allergic to dogs and cats, so i own neither. Should I ignore the "I like your dog more" or "I swiped right for your dog" parts of women's descriptions? Or should I not even bother with tinder because of it?   Or should rules 1 and 2 come first?	9
0	Lol @ my downvotes. Op blatantly said she was suprised she didn't get mad. If this was me telling a guy his GF sent me inappropriate pictures I'd be suprised if he DID get mad.  I'm sorry you girls on TrollXX are so insecure that you can't acknowledge a legit question if that question doesn't inflate your ego.	9
0	&gt;masturbated four times  How the hell do you women do that? I wish I could do that.	9
0	What do they say? Be careful what you wish for lol.	9
0	&gt;  Freedom of speech doesn't allow you to yell fire in a crowded theater because it can hurt other people  God, i wish this meme would die already. of course you can yell fire in a theater, like say, when there's a fire. It's not a restriction on free speech, it's a crime when you do it and there's no fire because then you're inciting a riot, which is it's own rule.   \#Themoreyouknow	9
0	LOL...like opie is going to give a guy making minimum wage the time of day.	9
0	Cept they sex her up to over compensate her bad assness, like every female super hero :&lt; don't even want to talk about power girl. Yeah the guys look sexy too but their actions aren't using their sexy against people. Idk, just annoys me.	9
0	So let me get this straight, you disagree with the premise of that post ? You think misandry does exist in society?	9
0	Why do you have nipple hair ?.....	9
0	Also, radical feminism is not satire.	9
0	Wtf? Why is that even the slightest bit relevant? (If I were an addict, which I'm not)	9
0	I didn't really care for how they damselized her in the latest movie...	9
0	At least read the fucking thing.	9
0	Burgeoning feminist:  I have to say I find this rather unconvincing.  Dismissing a specific double standard with an appeal to a general situation is a non-sequitur.  Or it seems to me.  That said though, I agree about the larger social image, and I don't think OP did anything really wrong, it's just a phrasing thing.	9
0	Yeah, I love mine.	9
0	I've always done a one treatment foot soak in some diluted bleach water. It has worked every time.	9
0	What gives you the authority to stop me from calling myself a feminist. You don't have any authority over the term.	9
0	LOL you're funny.	9
0	Anal is nature's birth control.	9
0	Love of boobs is something that unites all people. Regardless of race, nationality, religion, or even sexual preference. Everyone likes boobs.	9
0	Better get to work then	9
0	Yes, you are correct. I didn't mean to word it the way I did. I was mainly trying to point out that it seemed weird for someone to be so surprised that there is a name for the study of penises, in general. "Of course it has a name" makes it seem like it's some obscure thing that scientists have recently named just for the hell of it, as if it was some weirdly specific phobia or something. If there's a name for someone who works specifically with female reproductive systems, I don't think it's weird for there to be a name for someone who works specifically with male reproductive systems.	9
0	Done as in deleted the picture or just "done" as in you can't even.  lol  Next time, it's "New phone, who dis?"  lol works all the time	9
0	Not so much hurt, just a lot of disappointments. You get used to it though.	9
0	&gt; you yourself hate men  Erm..no I don't. I'm married to one :)	9

0	What's so special about that? I'm probably desentized because I have one, but I don't understand how that's viewed as one of the cooler parts of the penis.	9
0	I am being genuine here.   Fear of being sent pictures of dicks?  Is it something that causes distress?   How does the picture cause distress?	9
0	&gt;Bodily autonomy ends when it affects other people's bodies.  So tell me then why society is so lax upon those that are HIV+? Should they not be quarantined for the safety of the people at large? Or are you merely talking out your ass.	9

0	Reddit seems to think trigger warnings are a joke, but it is quite serious. I had a customer quietly ask me if I wouldn't mind standing near the restroom door because she had been sexually assaulted in a public bathroom by a guy. I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate being sent a picture of a random guy's dick.	9
0	Wow the kneejerk downvotes in this sub are ridiculous  Your posts look totally reasonable to me Edit: i also noticed a couple people calling you dude or man, as if anyone that comes in here that they dont like MUST be a man	9
0	I always say if you don't like sake you were probably drinking the cheap stuff. Not that there's anything wrong with that.   Maybe get them to try a chilled nigori sake. They tend to be sweeter and more accessible to the common man's palate.	9
0	Thankfully you have the option to open links in your inbox, so, eh.  If I get an imgur link in my inbox with few other words, or "Do you wanna see my PUPPY?" yeah, I know better.	9

0	It's not a 100% damsel in the sense of what it used to be, but she still essentially had to wait around for someone to come rescue her. I am NOT denying any of the positives of the character or what came out of the movie, but it troubled me that both female characters had a moment closer to a traditional damsel rescue than other cast members.	9

0	Lol, stay five my friend.	9
0	I posted like that about my mother today. I talk to her everyday even though I live really far away. The post is me acknowledging her and praising her for the world to see. I know she appreciates it more than a phone call.	9

0	But male circumcision CAN be genital mutilation in some cultures where they do it in unsanitary conditions... So while FGM can be much worse, obviously, male circumcision can also be very painful and even deadly.  Source: took a human sexuality class last semester and did a unit on these topics	9
0	Everyone wants to talk about the issue but no one wants to actually help the issue. Or they might not have the means to do so in which case fair enough	9
0	guess I come from a time when "nerd" actually meant something and wa generally derogatory. But now someone watches an episode of Psych and they call themselves a sci- fi nerd.   And there are people that play candy crush and call themselves "gamers" too  so go ahead water down the term.   nothing means anything anymore.	9

0	The Perks of Being a Wallflower	9
0	Genital mutilation is genital mutilation. It can be done with relatively little harm, or relatively much, and there's no doubt in my mind that on the whole women come out of it the worst. That doesn't make it not the same, and the issue is not served by fragmenting the discussion along gender lines.   What does "not the same" even mean in this context? Obviously it's pretty difficult to mutilate two opposite sets of genitalia in exactly the same way. I don't see how that's relevant.	9
0	graceless generalizations about gender aren't welcome in this sub unless they're about men and everyone agrees, in which case **lol men right**  edit: sorry, slightly bitter. I'll get over it	9

0	If I'm drunk enough, I might even ask you to pee in my purse while I watch.  Edit: I love you guys, but Trollx downvote flash mobs are a thing to behold	9
0	I dunno.  Maybe it's because I'm a man, maybe it's because I'm unlucky, maybe it's because I worked a drive through late nights for years on weekends and got a lot of drunkards, and so maybe I'm missing out on the bond.  Honestly though I can't think of many creatures more annoying than a drunk white girl. So many attempts at free food, loud, naggy, and they invade personal space.	9
0	Exactly. It's the whole "First they came for the Socialists" thing. Progress just doesn't happen when people "glaze over" things that are offensive people other than them.	9
0	Please try waxing instead. It's so worth it.	9
0	The article made the point that men in a mixed gender unit are going to treat the woman differently by trying to protect her. That's true and in a combat situation really could endanger everyone's lives.	9
0	My exact reaction today when my BF held his baby niece and let her take his glasses off repeatedly. Super adorable. His niece WANTED to be with him.	9
0	Not anatomically being the same is a necessary fact of different anatomies. It means one form of mutilation is more harmful than the other. This does not make the more harmful and less harmful forms of mutilation two separate issues.	9
0	It's safer for you than it is for him. People who commit crimes against people in public are overwhelmingly more likely to target men than women.	9
0	Well, women are significantly less likely than men to get murdered or even just assaulted in public.   Edit: Do people really find this that hard to believe? Way more men are murdered than women every year. Do you really think that this just stops being true in public? It doesn't. In fact, the ratio of men:women increases.	9
0	Celebration.  I drink when I'm happy, or sad. It's only when I'm in the middle that I'm sober.	9
0	Darling, that's a pretty dubious line of reasoning you're operating on.   You're imposing a very arbitrary distinction between when it is and isn't one's right to complain.	9
0	Haha, fair point. I'm pretty sure my justifications change with the circumstances in my life, but the bottom line is that I'm always enjoying my wine ;)	9
0	Honey, are you a victim of FGM? Because if not, then by your logic you also "can't" complain.	9
0	Now I am confused. The top comment was asking more about FGM. So he is an "ignorant, derailing piece of shit" because he asked a question? What a monster. Are you also presuming this redditor was male?  I can't find any links, but did you by chance respond to him saying this? Because this could have been an appropriate response without needing to be so confrontational.	9
0	She got defensive because everyone jumped on her shit and downvoted the hell out of her for something that she felt didnt deserve it.  At this point, fine, I understand. You dont like how she responded. But do you really think the way to get her to see your opinion is to be an ass about it? Maybe her comments were insensitive, but I dont think she meant harm. The reaction to them, however, was far more sarcastic and rude than she ever was. If you want someone to understand how they were being insensitive, the absolute WRONG course of action is to be an asshole to them.	9

0	Nope, because it's a pretty standard hex bolt.  The type of thing that could actually be turned in by a monkey wrench.  edit:  just noticed 2 other got this 9 hours ago, so, uh.	9
0	I use the word specifically because I'm specifically talking about white girls. White girls are generally more annoying when drunk. It's just part of the observation.	9
0	I don't really understand why, but my girlfriends parents generally like me.	9
0	You broke up with him, didn't you?	9
0	Because I'm not saying all drunk women are annoying. I'm singling out a specific demographic based on anecdotal evidence. Generalizing an entire gender would be ridiculous. I'm not some kind of sexist.	9
0	Again, what does that have to do with what I said here?	9
0	Get the fuck away from me, creep.	9
0	This is what happens when you spend all your time on tumblr. You think just leaving your house will get you raped.	9
0	I really don't think putting Nair in someone's shampoo or conditioner is dangerous and illegal. Are you someone who sees the world through an extremely legalistic lens?   Now, if I had advocated that she use violence against him, then yes, I could see where you were coming from. But my original idea was not dangerous in any way. You can't laugh off the bucket.	9
0	Eeeeeh. I've never drunk to the point of getting like that so it's hard for me to imagine. I'm as nice as I can be without just puking on top of them.	9
0	You really don't deserve the downvotes you're getting in this argument - You're adding plenty to the discussion.  Guys, let's not do the whole "downvote to disagree" thing, and keep the downvotes to people who are rude/dont add anything to the discussion	9
0	Lol people who smoke cigs are well aware of the risks. Hearing this kind of stuff from all friends, family, and strangers on the internet can be annoying as fuck. I know you're being genuine (deadlast) but I guess try to understand how it much feel when you KNOW a habit of yours is bad, and yet people continue to still try to lecture you about how bad said habit is.	9
0	Nope, you're a mama, you have a furbaby. You do you &lt;3 I also have a furbaby :)	9
0	It's NAIR. I wouldn't say it's harmless, but cutting hair normally is not assault. You remind me of my ex.	9
0	Not all people are mentally retarded. I wasn't speaking of the minority of men.	9
0	Don't use "I'm sorry you don't feel that way" on me. If guys don't rinse their hair thoroughly in the shower, that's not my fault.  I've never heard of guys using shampoo as face wash. There are face washes for that intended purpose.	9
0	Did you even click the link? It also shows that men are more likely to be assaulted in public than women. Significantly. It's pretty clear because men were victimized more, so even if being in public or knowing the perpetrator had no effect whatsoever on the gender ratio(which isn't the case), there would still be more male victims.	9
0	I didn't say it was a competition. It's great you work together. Who said life is a competition?	9

0	Oh right. Using heroin immediately takes your ability to do things in moderation.	9
0	So, your kid harasses someone's pet, and you expect the pet owner to be the one to deal with it by pulling their pet away? Classy.	9
0	That's pretty hot, though. Did you save it?	9
0	No, no I don't.  My kids don't do that.  However, if /u/Ryugi really feels that their animal is dangerous, control the animal (or just don't take it in public maybe?), don't try to control a stranger's child.  Particularly if "forcefully" and "HARD" is your goto for how to do it.  Parents react very badly to that sort of thing.	9
0	Possibly, but I did not actually use the words "forced hair removal" in the quote you highlighted. Please apologize for misrepresenting me.	9
0	Thank you. This means so much.	9
0	Just think how fabulously thin the starving children  in Ethiopia are and how great it would be to look like that.	9
0	hehe I was always that girl who wrecked the curve. That was the only thing that kept me going in high school. Knowing that i was fucking everyone else's test scores up without studying.	9
0	What's the point?	9
0	Did you blame him for how he acted in your head?	9
0	False. Most drunk girls are not this neat.	9
0	Listen, I'm with you on this. Stereotypical drunk girls are actually the WORST. I've never had a moment like any of these.	9
0	To me waxing my lady bits hurts way less than my legs. The only part that actually stings is when they do the top part of your pelvic area, in like a horizontal strip. The rest is easy.	9
0	If you like cider you have got to go to a cider festival or one of the bigger beer festivals that has a decent cider range. PM me if you want more details and don't want your location to be totally public :)	9
0	Sorry trolls just a little upset this morning about the whole thing	9
0	No I'm worried about him more. But I can't convince him to care about himself. He cares more about the festival than anything. He usually goes to EDC, but couldn't this year. So he's upset about it. And the whole freaking thing is a mess.	9
0	Fair enough. Both of us have been there, done that. For me at least disillusionment doesn't get near describing how I feel about cohabitation. I don't think it's healthy for people long term; we're trying to find a new way to stay together by not being under each other's feet.	9
0	Yup. And do we really need another physical copy of parental rights? I could wallpaper my house!	9
0	Someone's angry.  I've taught my kids up down and sideways on how we approach animals leashed and unleashed. My eldest is autistic and everything goes out the window when he sees a dog. He literally forgets everything that we have just talked about. I try my hardest, but there are times where he gets to the dog first and I can't help. Maybe instead of being so angry about shitty parents, take the opportunity to educate the kid. Being angry at them doesn't solve a damn thing.	9
0	The thread was specifically about genital mutilation. The article  happened to focus on women, but that doesn't mean genital mutilation of all kinds has no place in the discussion.   You're mad because you think men hijacked a thread that was "supposed" to be about women. The way I see it, you went to a thread about genital mutilation and got mad that someone posted about the *wrong kind* of genital mutilation. It doesn't make sense to me.	9
0	Well, good luck, momma! The meetings suck, but if we don't advocate for our kids, no one will! Stand your ground and don't let them strong arm you. You got this!	9

0	You can learn everything about your hoe-mones, how to get pregnant and avoid it from this book Taking Charge of Your Fertility. http://www.harpercollins.com/web-sampler/9780060881900 I have never used the pill or even the thermometer. I just look at how wet I am before sex to decide on condoms or not. Only messed up once and it was because the mushrooms told me to.	9
0	This is written like all men she's ever come in contact with has treated her that way.	9
0	Yeah but it's heavily implied.	9
0	That sucks, mental disorders are terrible. Happens to most people actually, they just don't know or don't feel it compromises their life.   Could you imagine being a pedophile? Talk about a living nightmare. I imagine living as one to feel like growing up gay, insecurity sexually as well as ostracized from society due to this desire. Gay people however find support, pedophiles are hated by everyone.  Idk if I could date a pedophile but I think I could look past it given more things about the person.	9
0	She talks about being beaten and raped and then at the bottom says "so the next time you feel like victimizing a girl". Not all of it is directed at men but some of the statements are.	9
0	You never know.  He could just be telling the truth and is really a sickly germ-factory.  And who *wouldn't* want to go on a date with that?	9
0	Correlation does not equal causation.	9
0	If he's getting treatment and counseling for it, doesn't act on it, etc.; how will that affect your feelings and perception of him?  I wonder if it's fair to compare this to a destructive addiction?  I don't have any experience with this sort of thing...	9
0	Shhhhhhh...........	9
0	I don't have any experience with pedophelia specifically but I just want to point out that people don't get to pick their fetishes. It isn't like the difference between orientation and fetish is that clear anyway, it wasn't that long ago that homosexuality was considered a paraphilia.  EDIT: That said, anyone with a destructive or harmful paraphilia should seek therapy ASAP. Just because it wasn't a choice doesn't make it okay.	9
0	Just realize that a large group will never have one mindset, and anything that can be said about Men's Rights can probably be said about Feminism too. There will always be assholes in every group, and the lens through which we view things will always effect how we see them.	9
0	I want to marry that woman.	9
0	I've gotten a lot of answers to my question but this is probably the most fair answer.  I mean, a lot of the other ones made good points, but this is the most unbiased assessment.	9
0	Some of it just feels like a blanket statement. Yes men victimized women but women abuse men as well but the people that are like that aren't the majority in either group.	9
0	Those don't rhyme though..	9
0	Depends on the two people, really. If it were me (I'm 5'1" and 110lbs), I'd be worried about being grabbed and taken for use as a hostage, honestly.   It's one of those contextual things, to my mind.	9
0	&gt;We know that men are shamed for emotions, etc. under the patriarchal system, and that's why we want to weaken the system.   That's good, I just wanted to point out the statement that "feminism already addresses most of the problems faced by men" is wrong. Masculinism isn't just a placeholder to keep egalitarianism looking gender equal. It actually fulfills a purpose and I don't think that point should be downplayed.	9
0	No, those nipples seem pretty dangerous.	9
0	It's simultaneously the biggest ego boost + seriously stressful. I keep worrying someone's going to be like "wait, this isn't what I was expecting; give me my money back". Lol.	9
0	*hugs* Quick, do something fun!  For serious, though, please tell someone you're close to irl? you can go out for ice cream and comic books. Don't let the spiral, uh, spiral out of control!	9
0	I think there's a really big difference between advocating for accessibility for therapy for pedophiles to reduce their chances of offending and to actually sympathize and feel bad for pedophiles who can't be open with their urges.	9
0	Even then it can still crumble and be all over the god damn place. Brings back fond college memories...	9
0	Not to invalidate your pain of having to go commando, but I've been going commando under jeans/leggings/some skirts depending on length for a couple months now and had no issue! It really started because im lazy and poor and no matter what kind of underwear i get they always seem to be either to big or too tight in the crease between my legs and my lady bits.	9
0	is pedophilia 100% inborn?	9
0	congrats, but the real world doesn't care much about GPA.	9
0	It was a great post! I think it's deffo hard to be critical of either women or feminism in the female centric subs without earning misunderstanding and hate but it's important to remember that we are all different with our own unique views and we need to be open to critical opinions to improve as a community.	9
0	I feel that the problem with saying "feminists" and "MRA's" is that it also includes the extremists. If I say "feminists are also about helping men", MRA's will show you the "#KillAllMen" campaign. And if I say "MRA's are also about helping women" feminists will show you "The Red Pill" and /r/MensRights.	9
0	it's just the wording that bugs me. It should have been something like "If Nick Offerman's wife didn't like his last name" or something.	9
0	That's easy to say as an outsider. Like I said, many mental health professionals won't even counsel pedophiles....where exactly are they supposed to go for help?	9
0	Not tryna be salty but why post here not trolly?	9
0	Not everything needs a trigger warning.	9

0	Where, not were.	9
0	As it should have!	9
0	Hard to tell from just text.	9
0	I do not in any way indentify as a MRA, nor indentify as a feminist, exactly because people project their own ideologies onto me and act exactly like you just did and because neither of these ideologies have acted responsibly. I believe that feminism is a just cause, but if I call myself a feminist, the extremists hear that I support them, just as much as I support true equality.	9

0	The internet is no place for tiny children, sweet summer child.	9
0	that doesn't sound offensive, but I think after having someone use it against you as a way to cut you off at the knees (jealously) kinda makes it hard to see it that way.  or i'm weird.  i'm weird.	9
0	Huh, never seen the motte and bailey effect before, gonna read up about that.  But sure, I shouldn't expect too much. But I AM gonna expect just a little bit, because TrollX at least seem more "discussable" if that word fits.	9
0	Haha thanks! Of course my boyfriend wishes I wore panties more often because he thinks it's more fun to rip off more layers of clothes or whatever.	9
0	What about protecting your family? I think that would be kind of important if an intruder broke into my house at night.	9
0	I just get so sad, when the size of a community governs "what to talk about". I mean, we should be able to talk about whatever! But I guess that's "group mentallity" :/	9
0	You're not wrong, they do rhyme.  Sometimes rhyme is used like "sounds like" instead of it's technical meaning.  English is weird sometimes.	9
0	I was thinking the same thing.  "Buffeet?"	9
0	God. I am already so done with this. It was funny the 1st time but I'm honestly tired of seeing it. Welcome to the Internet! Lol.	9
0	&gt; Gay people however find support, pedophiles are hated by everyone.  ...  &gt; I was speaking of pedophilia as a ~~psychosis~~ mental disorder  I'm pretty sure that's where you wrote "psychosis" before you edited it.	9
0	You can absolutely sharpen them with no problem at all, and the caps should stay on if you push harder (sometimes air gets trapped and makes them float, but you just need to push a little harder). I find it difficult to believe you'd get two pencils of different shades with the same cap problem.	9
0	Like I said, been at this since 2008. Totally worth the little bit of extra effort.	9
0	I'm sorry I offended so many people.  That was not my intention, but I just thought calling a person 'douche/dummy' because someone paid too close attention to them was harsh.  I see OP's point.  I understand that as a man i don't have the same perspective as a woman, but I'd like to think I'm raising my children to be wise, kind, strong AND tolerant but alert.	9
0	Probably not a good idea if you have a job working with children though.	9
0	now we know you're brittish, guvna.  Didja get blood on ya'Knickers too?  lololololo	9
0	Acknowledging paedophilia as a sexual orientation is not the same as condoning child abuse.   I acknowledge heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality as orientations, but I'm still not okay with them raping whoever attracts them.	9
0	I think we've already reached broad definitions of sexual orientations when shit like pansexuality and sapiosexuality are taken seriously.  Downvote me all you fucking please, I just hope you don't take yourself seriously if you agree that we don't have broad definitions of orientation that pedophilia can fit into, but somehow a bazillion different other orientations do fit into it and aren't worthy of an iota of criticism.	9

0	Well, if it's day 3, make a little effort to reach out. These people are going to be around you for as long as you work there. I'm struggling to make an effort to say hi to everyone around me. But I know that it'll be worth it.	9
0	You mean, " as a man, when I come into a female and fairly feminist space, and I start criticizing feminism and speaking about men's rights and the ladies here provide some very valid critiques of the MRM but I'm going to call it mudthrowing and hate-talkijg."	9
0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVUyyHYkBHk   Yes you are.	9
0	I have nothing against the valid points. It's the "all *insert an ideology other than feminism* are just people who hate women" that I find ignorant and hypocritcal, because it's the exact same arguement extremeist MRA's use when describing feminists "they are just people hating men". That us not a valid critisism.  I understand that this is a place for women to have space, and I love the discussions here, but I feel sometimes that some critisism is getting shut down way too quickly.	9
0	How much do you weigh?	9
0	Am I a terrible person if a part of me thinks that's hilarious? It's the stuff of ridiculous movies	9

0	but most good companies and good jobs provide maternity leave and to an extent paternity leave.  it is not legally mandated but for the the most part US multinationals offer leave.	9
0	&gt; if everyone except SD choses to identify as a Feminist, then it's kind of impossible to talk about what feminists stand on any issue since the actual ideological and political differences are just too vast between M/C/KD and V/MP/FI  Wait what?

0	I'm also a male magician, while no you shouldn't go around doing magic just to "impress chicks" if you know some tricks and also have a passion for it then you can impress them with the off-hand bit of magic here and there. It's worked for me every time.	9
0	Nah just the west /s	9
0	Funny, I have never met one of these extreme feminists.	9
0	your personal experience in hiring is worth some note, but you're one of many who hire and there *are* many out there who *do not* look at GPAs. everyone is different, no one should assume you'll be hired because of your GPA.	9
0	That is skill! I love having my hair pulled out of the way. And pulled in general :p scalp orgasms during a blowjob are theee best!	9
0	oh, you're one of *those* graduates.  Getting A's feels great, but guess what? there are no grades out in the real world.   what will you do to get that high from straight A's?!?	9
0	Why thank you kind troll! I think I will. ;]	9
0	Withholding it as manipulation is sexual violence. There's a difference between not wanting sex, and denying sex to cause emotional distress to get what you want. Like saying, "I'm not having sex with you until you buy me a new car" is sexual abuse in the same way saying "I won't love you until you buy me a new car" is emotional abuse. It's using sex as power and manipulation.	9
0	Hell yes! The copay on mine was like $20, I figured that was more than reasonable for 5 years of babby repellent.	9

0	If you do it right, the "pull out" method is only about 1% less effective than condoms. NOT FOR STDS THOUGH.	9
0	What a moron! Seriously girl needs to be smacked, in the face , with a brick.	9
0	Dogs are so much better than Cats : )  Cats are jerks q:	9
0	I did NuvaRing for a decade and its great but I'm looking forward to not having to worry for years to come. Best of luck!	9
0	Baby repellent! I'm stealing this!	9
0	And then you'll be the bitch. Grow a thicker skin and don't be an entitled cunt about it. This doesn't have to be nearly as huge an issue as you're making it.	9
0	At which point employers will look for single people and those who have already had children. A company doesn't hire someone out of the goodness of their heart and if one employee will cost them significantly more than another employee they will obviously have bias.	9
0	It's like a cross to repel vampires, but a T to repel babies.	9
0	you seem like a total cunt	9
0	I did not think so. I found it excruciatingly tedious.	9
0	I don't know any of my friend's birthdays. People need to announce that stuff every year or else I'm going to completely forget.	9
0	Oh, I see! Well, at least you ended up going!	9
0	Yes this is the answer. ARE YOU HAPPY NOW GUYS?	9
0	Well, if you start killing people, you can't really be held accountable.	9
0	Idk, but it makes me want to gag.	9
0	for me.   Dames=gorgeous highly desirable girl  Broad=non descriptive, generic girl.   I'll use it in a sentence.  Instead of saying. hey that girls is super sexy, and attractive.. that girl is a dame  or  hey into_the_groove, who was driving that fancy sports car? Ah some broad. instead of using girl, women, etc.  I typical use it as a pronoun.	9
0	well there's way more actual evidence of presidents actually saying stuff.  'extreme' or 'radical' feminist complaints so often sound like it's a chain letter from grandma.  how does everybody meet the same one?	9
0	whut.  i think you are confused about anatomy.	9
0	This is something I've noticed, too. At least on tumblr. They most rabid feminists, especially radfems, are always ugly and/or fat. I know beautiful feminists like Beyoncé exist but they're hard to find. I've yet to see a pretty radfem.	9
0	~~betch~~ yes, please! :)  thanks for showin' that sub, interesting aaaaaaand not what i thought it was.	9
0	why not just have him go to the doctors to get a STD panel done if thats your only fear?	9
0	Nothing you can do will help.	9
0	I have two classes left and I'm still able to work on campus, but it's going to be weird not scrambling to register for fall classes...  Even though I was only at this school for two years, I kinda feel like this place is my second home.  Am I weird for having post-graduation school feels?	9
0	Best of luck to the both of you.  I hope you can get your friendship back to as strong as it was before.  And hopefully you can apply this lesson to your next opportunity.	9
0	Look at that gross fat booty. Who even likes fat booty?!	9
0	actually, _you're_ can be a contraction of "you are" _or_ "you were", since both end in -re.   In an ambiguous context like this one, I generally find it best to avoid using the contraction for exactly this reason, but it's not incorrect.	9
0	It might be the disillusioned ridiculously pretty, manipulative girls that have everything handed to them that might think this way.	9
0	Especially relying on strangers. Internet strangers. You've done yourself, and this sub, a real disservice.	9
0	Ugh  *hands the ginger ale over*	9
0	Nice!    We've been 9 years pill free here.  Vasectomy is awesome.  (his choice...)	9
0	Eh, I didn't take it as uplifting. To me, calling out to someone that "it will be alright" when you have no idea who they are or what's going through their head is on the same plane as telling someone to smile.  I don't assume he meant anything wrong but it's not intent that matters when you're invading someone else's day.	9
0	No.   If you want to stay, you could look at grad school, or becoming a professor if you've already done grad work.	9
0	I'm jelly! I've been on NuvaRing for years but being set for five is awesome.	9
0	You won't regret it; good luck :)	9
0	I just... wait. What the actual fuck? Just why would someone say that? To appear to be a cock?	9
0	Mine are definitely the saggiest in any given room. We're dangerously close to fried-egg-on-a-nail territory over here.	9
0	There's been some talk about them getting a CrimJ grad program, so going back there for grad school might be a real possibility.	9
0	&gt; No, no I don't. ... expect the pet owner to **be the only one** to deal with it...  Context is important.	9
0	Parents can react unpredictably if they are not familiar with a person or type of person. Especially if they have no past history with the other person. It doesn't mean the parent is violent or dangerous.	9
0	That phrase is means that it takes a community, as in, grocers, firemen, teachers, police etc..  As in, no family can exist solely on it's own.  Not that every adult is expected to pretend to parent the kids.	9
0	Hey I can tell you about some penis problems if you want!	9
0	So we should make offerings of wine and chocolate to appease the goddesses?	9
0	Wow, that's just all kinds of fucked up. I do hope that he gave up after that, realizing he was more likely to hurt than help you?  Or if he doesn't I would literally involve the police, because he is a direct danger to your health.	9
0	Good thing I can then!  Shame I can't seem to teach you that touching peoples kids is not ok.  Oh well.	9
0	Yeah, it's a bit of a stretch to sell a movie (produced, written and directed by men) starring a **straight-white-cis-man** that saves women from their lives as **sex slaves** as some piece of feminist propaganda; no matter how scrappy the lady sidekick is or how many feminist authors consult on the supporting characters (read: human MacGuffins). If this is Hollywood pandering to women's rights, just ug.	9
0	I think he's an asshole and an idiot  He was a teacher, he helped a *lot* of students. Any jackbutt knows you can't fucking do what he did. But he did.   Not only that but he's *married* or, was anyway.   Sorry if it's not coherent, I'm still pretty upset	9
0	I'm giving these ones a try now http://www.pinkcherry.ca/l-amour-pleasure-system-weighted-balls-in-periwinkle-in-periwinkle  and the vibrations while I walk are like :0	9
0	see, if i would to advice you in this situation, i would tell you to tell him you have a goatse (stretching/prolapsing of a man's anus/extreme gaping) fetish or be really into Sounding (inserting things into the penis), and then tell him to "image search it on Bing and you'll be in for a surprise ;)".  he sounds like a right shithead anyway. naps are awesome.	9
0	Of course.  Everyone gets wine and chocolate!  I'm in Canada so if you're over 19 it's cool	9
0	This is the gif I needed in my life, and that is a super uncomfortable situation :(	9
0	Well thank you.  And yes, I completely understand that sentiment.	9
0	Nope! Not up for grabs. We tried polyamory in the beginning but it didn't work - we were just waaay too into each other.	9
0	WHY?!?!	9
0	Haha I have a good memory for some stuff. Especially something that I actually followed for like 5 years.	9
0	I have this sinking feeling that you're Indian.   Edit: wow, I asked because OP said she isn't Middle Eastern, and I know a lot of Westerners mistake Indians for Middle Easterners. I was not trying to offend or imply anything.	9
0	You used the semi-colon wrong. A comma would've sufficed.	9
0	You still haven't told me how it fixes anything. Tell me, how is it constructive?	9
0	I think it's a bit of a stretch to call the guy a misogynist. Immature and weird, I grant, and he probably shouldn't be employed there anymore, since he evidently is unwilling to do his job, but nothing that I read in the article suggests a hatred of women. Just a dude who is excessively grossed out by menstruation, apparently.	9
0	We get both snapshots at once, if you will. Now nobody has to go hunting for the other side of the story.	9
0	Did those same people boycott Dredd?	9
0	My pets are my kids too. Doesn't mean that I'm an asshole to those who don't have pets or kids. I don't think that demanding I keep my kids away from you in a public place is a very rational request.	9
0	If you don't want to know everything there is to know about fannies, then *you are gay*	9
0	Maybe we have different definitions of sexy. I don't usually go for the dirty bums who convince me to drop out of school and use a fake name type.	9
0	Sttopp  it please :((	9
0	Haha, in that regard I do feel sorry for you :P   You're good at descriptive text, I'll tell you that much!	9
0	You mean at least like 40 percent of this sub? The humble brags get sooooooo old.	9
0	Truth. Long term relationship = can't stay out past 11pm. Can shoot the shit at a mates place, drinking, whatever. I've got a stricter curfew than Cinderella.   eta: HOLY SHIT I was making a joke about myself and my long term relationship habits. Sorry that you all seem to think I'm attacking you for some reason.	9
0	In Australia, we have what's called an RSA (responsible service of alcohol) and RCG (responsible conduct of gambling). These certificates enable us to work in pubs and clubs that serve liquor and have gambling.	9
0	Haha! There needs to be more girls like you out there.  EDIT: I didn't mean to be rude! I was trying to say she sounds awesome I wish I had someone similar in my life, that's all. I know a lot of girls but none of them are really into that kinda stuff.	9
0	How did you respond? I think I'd have blurted out, "Um ... WHY?"	9
0	I imagine it wouldn't be much different than it would for you, lack of enthusiasm, not hitting the right spots, the wrong partner, too much or too little spit, that kind of thing.	9
0	Since my sister told me about it, it's become a pet agenda to tell people that [long term use of "sleeping pills" is not really effective](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23432361), it's just a placebo with some negative side effects at that point.	9
0	There are ways around pantylines that aren't thongs. Everyone needs multiple types of underwear.   Besides thongs at that age introduce a whole host of things that really shouldn't be introduced. Are the girls going to feel bad about their pubic hair? Shaving down there is complicated--I have keloid scars from ingrown hairs.  Also, other girls having cute undies made me feel bad about my own more basic ones.  To me the worst part is that the mother needed to ask the Aunt to take the daughter shopping. Like, if its just about different undies then take your own daughter shopping.	9
0	Sorry to hear that. This guy sounds like a real dick.	9
0	It's the best feeling ever. I love when my boyfriend plays video games and I get to watch. It's so much better than tv!	9
0	I thought that, too, until his late nights alone turned into late nights with another night owl. Now, I think I'd prefer someone on a more me-schedule.	9
0	Excellent deployment of the Maggie gif.  A+.	9
0	Update: I am covered in crumbs.	9
0	I can have you home and happy by 8:30	9
0	That would drive me *insane*; I like to be in control of the controller (unless it's an fps - I'm complete garbage at shooters).	9
0	Indians do not like being called Middle Eastern. I'm pretty sure it's seen as really racist to mistake the two. I meant that as "I have this really bad feeling OP is about to say she's Indian, which is going to make racism of the guy she's talking about *a lot* worse"	9
0	Like I said, helpful to you. You have a clear disregard for the people involved and serve only to stir shit up.	9
0	Why is the account deleted? :(	9
0	[yeah I can, asshole](http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2015/05/gwendoline-christie-star-wars)	9
0	lol my tweet had a bit of karma and now it's -4. I guess we got raided by the asshole troupe.  you mention the book, then you mention the show. What the hell do you want to talk about? Pick one. If you seriously cannot tell the difference between GOT and whatever this movie is going to be, then how am I supposed to even discuss anything with you?	9
0	But, you have a wife. Why go out? Isn't that the point?	9
0	YESSS I have these too, but they're fuzzy pants. They're my absolute favorite jammies.	9
0	It's going to get better! I promise it will.  Breathe deep, treat yourself to something, and you'll get through it!	9
0	Honestly, I'm not a great gamer.  I get frustrated easily and often give up.  Most games I own, I've only played the very beginning because I get stuck and I just get bored trying to get past whatever I'm stuck on.  So I'd love to sit and watch someone play games that I'm interested in, but know I'd never be able to beat!	9
0	&gt; If I had the opportunity to do something reversible (vasectomy is reversible sometimes, but not always) that would mean I could not use them, and still be in control of whether I have kids and not have to ask my SO to take hormones with side effects...  Aka condoms?	9
0	I was asked to be the Maid of Honor at 20, going to school part time, and working full time. I agreed because I thought it was just a title, and had no idea the responsibilities that came with it. 0/10 Would not do again, unless I had a million dollars and no other work to speak of. Neither of those things will ever happen.	9
0	But that doesn't make a comment like that any more okay.	9
0	I can't tell if you're saying that just to say something or going for upvotes.	9
0	TBH, I feel like unless you are making her cum pretty often, you can't really complain about not enjoying sex as much with a condom on, though I do agree that I hate condoms, they smell bad and irritate me, but from a woman 's POV, it's a silly argument.	9
0	You are the best! Thanks so much for the link. See-ya I'm going shopping.	9
0	[Basically the same mindset](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a8/26/ca/a826ca1fcb32c665abc9673101e73116.jpg)	9
0	Wonderful!! I hope you enjoy your chill time. It's a necessity. Don't forget to treat yo self every once in a while. Even if it is just Netflix, comfort food, and pjs😀	9
0	Well, I am sorry that not all of us can handle changes as well as you can.	9
0	What is this, 1955? There is nothing sexual about a thong. It's fucking cloth. Stop sexualizing clothing items.	9
0	It will be a lot of late nights and help of the secret literary elf squad, but yeah :)	9
0	What's wrong with them?	9
0	I have this saved on my phone for when my anxiety becomes too much to handle. I hope things get better for you soon! *hugs*	9
0	Thanks for that.  Neither of these kids are ones she particularly likes, but as I said, because its a small knit group of kids, she does her best to stay friendly.    (I never remember your username but I do remember you flair and I always love your POV on things)	9
0	I live in a cat condo with my cats and the neighborhood cats because I have the good crunchies.	9
0	Again, you're just hurt that you've been called out. Now, I have more empathy for your good friend than I do for you.	9
0	I got stuck in Bioshock like a year ago and haven't had the stamina to go back and force myself through, so I totally understand how it feels sometimes. The Big Daddies make me panic and flail.	9
0	It wasn't her responsibility to fix anything... I am sorry if I gave that impression.  The admin was trying to sort out the issue and pulled her in because she was witness to several things and was trying to understand the baseline.  Apparently other parents had heard about the issue and called in.  It seems in her school, they acquire information and then deal with the issue at hand.	9
0	See above comment.  I wasn't very clear with her role.  She actually didn't have to talk to either of the kids.  Just the admin.	9
0	Ah ok; still, it may help for her to talk to them since they're in the same small group, if for nothing else than the fact that any work they have to do together becomes much more difficult with a nasty rivalry.	9
0	I just project a normalized version of myself onto people who are completely anonymous and make the assumption that they can figure out how what I'm saying relates to their context. I bet you it's  only like a 50% chance this person is a girl though. I doubt it's any better to assume. Assuming he's a straight male is also a pretty good bet in most of reddit.	9
0	None of that seems unreasonable to me. The lack of boys guidelines seems weird. So guys could show up in jeans/T-shirt?	9
0	Quick! Someone fire a TrollX invite to the author, stat!	9
0	Are you doing my dishes in return?	9
0	You're missing the point. It's not about comfort but more what's suitable for kids. Thongs wasnt't invented for comfort, it was invented for women to look sexier. Kids shouldn't look sexy, not even close. It's the same with high heels and make up. It's not suitable for children because it's not MADE for kids, it's made for grown women.	9
0	Well, my cat would *love* the treats, but she'd probably rather gnaw on your hand than chase the pointer.  She will only play with twist ties (preferably red), clothespins, and those little plastic pull-tabs from under the caps of almond milk and coffee cream.  She has unique tastes.	9
0	I read that years ago!	9
0	Make sex worse??? If your sex life is already bad, the problem is not the condoms.	9
0	Time to say goodbye, right? Right?  D:	9
0	That is so cool of you to try and explore your sexuality even in an LDR setting; you're going to just *explode* once you're in together!	9
0	Until he was on it though, it's a worry, not a given.	9
0	The use of the word "worse" implies that it is already bad.    If you are using the right condom for you, they really aren't that bad.  Trojan's Ecstasy is a good one to try.  And they are a hell of a lot better than HIV, HPV, chlamydia, herpes...  Birth control is not the only reason to wear a condom.	9
0	worse - bad or ill in a greater or higher degree   http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/worse	9

0	Ah, so a condom can't ruin a moment but a women condom can?	9
0	RIP vibrator. you're in valhalla now.	9
0	flash cards like a crazy person, freerice, and duolingo!	9
0	Upset? I love this sub but I still do not understand women.	9
0	Because it's my default when I'm making a comment that functionally has no dependence on the gender or sexually of the person I'm speaking to. I'm not interested in considering the particulars of the person when I make a short, inoffensive joke of a reply just for the sake of technical correctness.	9
0	I can't really understand it either. People keeping trying to tell stories in a single title. I think that maybe the flowers were at work but she didn't know until she got home?	9
0	.....you still think this is about Mad Max?	9
0	You seem so much more dedicated than me! I would love to travel everywhere and just be able to get around without a hassle. I'ms o paranoid when travelling to other countries about people swindling me or something. So I want to you know, not have that happen.  It'd be amaaaazing though.	9
0	Even with all the various forms of birth control out there, here's something to keep in mind.  *If you do the crime, be prepared to do the time.*  The entire point of sex is reproduction.   If you don't want to have kids, don't have sex.	9
0	I never said anything about abstinence programs. I was simply stating that if you are having sex, there is a chance of pregnancy.	9
0	Amusing, but...did that tweet really warrant an entire article?	9
0	what the fuck? no, it was never about whatever bullshit movie would've pulled this, they're all the same. I don't care if it was any other beloved nerd franchise, I wouldn't've given it a free ride. This is inexcusable, it's 2015.   what reboot nostalgia franchise hasn't taken a big shit on all it's female fans so far? Is it so bad to want ONE that doesn't either acknowledge our existance, or laugh in our face?	9
0	Im a guy and cant wait for Vasalgel and RISUG for this reason. I aint tryna here that "I'm pregnant" bullshit after being promised she was on birth control like I have seen many guys fall prey to.	9
0	It is I insist on only receiving oral sex until I am married.  I am doing my part.  jk	9
0	I disagree and I'll tell you why. Condoms lessen the sensitivity of the penis during sex. Sex doesn't feel as good or as intimate. However, if a man were able to take a daily pill and go rawdawg without fear of kids, I think many would. A lot of guys are scared of their gf/SO secretly going off of birth control. Some would feel more comfortable from double protection.  It's the same reason vaginal dams are not popular, but oral pills are.	9
0	I will take your word for it.	9
0	As a guy that takes medication every day, I would say otherwise.	9
0	Removed for:  &gt;No posts about other subreddits, threads, or users.	9

0	This is the police, rightly or wrongly the environment can become toxic b/c you basically get desensitised to all the bad shit. But that's what happens when you make people work a job where their exposed to that stuff for years on end without proper counselling or mental health advice.	9

0	I'm from the Northwest Territories so I'm also familiar with that level of cold and I'd still choose that over heat in a heartbeat. Maybe it's genetics or something. I'm just not bred for warmth.	9
0	Most of the time. Until my feels get involved. haven't heard from my SO in three weeks. he's in sana cruz for work for 6 months. It's a three hour drive. I am totally a sad banana over it. :|	9
0	I hate being that guy, but did you really think Boehner was going to accept something pro-choice?	9
0	I feel ya. :( My boyfriend and I won't be able to communicate through anything but sparse emails for a while this summer, and I am a [very grumpy duck.](http://funnyasduck.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/funny-say-it-to-my-face-baby-chick-pics.jpg)	9
0	I'm sorry, that sucks! But being sad is okay, it doesn't make you week, it just shows that you care.	9
0	I agree. I was recently hired and there are two others that do the same work. The guy who trained me copies me on all of his emails to customers and I do the same. The third won't. We have awful outdated technology so when she's out and someone wants something she did it's a pain in the ass. If she fucking copied us in the first place I could just pull it up that way.	9
0	Good lord..let's be friends. Grumpy duck is the best way to put it	9
0	My anti-depressants did this. My birth control did this. Fuck big pharma.	9
0	*hugs*    Always keep supplies with you, if anything they're handy if you come across an accident and you need something to bandage a wound with or something.	9

0	Oh, I never meant it to be that way! It's just the last time I made a post like this, a lot of people requested the link I was referencing.	9
0	In all seriousness I always thought shakin women's hands an introducing myself was a weird/loser/pathetic way to approach women, like sayin out loud "hurr durr pwetty grill reminds me of mommy", I really have issues...	9
0	Oh man, 'cute girl' is a great way to send me ragin'.	9
0	&gt; Feminazi is one of my most hated words because it gets tossed around with some sort of 'profundity', like if they throw this then your argument is moot!  So the female version of saying a guy has a tiny dick	9
0	Don't tell her anything. Leave town and don't tell her about it, so that if she decides to show up at your house or something, you won't be reachable. Is your mom a narcissist, or just maybe a bit overbearing?	9
0	Desperate guys with small dicks	9
0	Might be because no one plays like this, guy or girl. Talking in PvP is already pretty rare, let alone the amount of trash talking these supposed "male gamers" do. Wouldn't this be more appropriate to troll the trolls rather than just "male gamers"?  Furthermore, the footage is from Xbox yet she's using a PS4 controller that's not even turned on. Huh.	9
0	Because being fat is so bad, right?	9
0	There's wanting to be treated like a human and then there's #killallmen. Pick one.	9

0	Why? Characterize them as people! Write them just like men except they don't fall over when getting kicked in the groin.	9
0	It's because no body wants to listen to rock music from the 80s. It's literally garbage.	9
0	Is your ex a woman? I mean, I had a former friend like that once. I had to change some usernames on social media but I'm sure they still read/stalk my twitter account despite her being blocked.	9
0	You are absolutely hopeless. By not demonstrating how you've helped deescalate the situation, and lying about it I might add,  &gt; Someone else found the link for me in that thread as I was going to look through all the recent posts on here. &gt; I wasn't linking to cause drama, but since someone asked...   you've proven yourself to be a disingenuous little fucker. Not that little fuckers like you care. I came here for help and support. But I guess I was an idiot for that. Instead I become the punching bag for self sustaining circle jerk of psuedo love and care.	9

0	I sure hope you went to your neighbor's house and told them you'd lost your bank card and couldn't buy TP. That's what neighbors are for.	9
0	Okay, *in that context it makes more sense. The caps made it feel really aggressive   Edit : *spelling. Why you shouldn't reddit drunk   Edit 2: same thing	9
0	I believe it would be a bit more sensitive if you said "little person" script rather than referring to it as "dwarven."	9
0	I just don't really care about that sort of stuff really   Either way I'm a failure, why bother, right?	9
0	And I believe 98.5 WNCX cuts it off at 1985, except for when classic bands release new material.	9
0	I heard some GnR on an oldies station a few weeks ago. Made me feel old, and I'm 19.	9
0	my only issue is that he wanted to pay for her meal?	9
0	I'm pretty sure he didn't mean that every woman who gets an abortion is a feminazi, but rather that the label applies to any sick fuck who *tries* to get pregnant with the sole aim of aborting the fetus.   Similarly, today's "feminazis" go far above and beyond the egalitarian aims of feminism, advocating the mutilation or murder of men for no reason other than their gender in the most extreme cases.	9
0	last semester I called out a teacher for doing a credit-less "Extra" problem that involved calculating the angular momentum and velocity of a person on the top of a ladder that got pushed back from the window in which he was peeping. Teacher asked what movie this was from.  I wrote "invasion of privacy isn't cute, screw you" as an answer.  I've seen him reconsidering impending jokes ever since.	9
0	Exactly. One of these is feminism or egalitarianism, the other is feminaziism.	9
0	Ugggh Last year my boss left and I ended up inheriting the job. She left a very half-assed list of things that needed to be done throughout the year, fortunately I was doing most of them already (because she basically did nothing, just sat around and collected credit for work she did not do) so I was able to fill in *most* of the blanks. Nothing like spending the first six months at a job doing damage control!	9
0	euphoria is a common side effect of hepatitis C.	9
0	I'm sure there's at least one.  And as for the second, there are many who advocate for that stuff on social media. I doubt most of them are serious, but again, I'm sure there's at least one.	9
0	What was the restraining order for?	9
0	Hold please, will link something that has all the funny emojis you can make in chat...	9
0	So sitting in lap is a green light, thank you for the knowledge. I will be sure to put it to good use if the situation ever arises.	9
0	That cat is super cute	9
0	In the West we straighten our teeths, meanwhile in Japan they do surgeries to make your teeth crooked. Interesting cultural differences	9
0	While I agree that it's insensitive, that doesn't invalidate my original point: that getting upset over it is silly.  Getting upset will only reinforce the views of the people who currently use it.	9
0	Any time, literally *any time* I get a text from a woman, I tell my wife. I used to tell her every single time I was going to be in a place alone with a woman. (I can't always do that now, as I'm a lawyer and have to meet with female clients, and confidentiality and whatnot.)  Not a road I want to walk down.	9
0	I don't think anyone has a problem with you not liking '80s music; It's just the fact that you say "nobody want to listen to 80s music", "it's all garbage", "just general badness" that has people downvoting you. Also you really only listed hard rock, glam metal, and new wave '80s bands that you dislike, and that's only a portion of what '80s rock had to offer.	9
0	&gt; the analog is castration  Women who underwent FGM can still get a child. A castrated man can not get a women pregnant.  &gt; That's why it's called female castration.  Nope.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oophorectomy  I see you have done your research.	9
0	That's my thoughts too. It's like Christmas, I want to be surprised with the contents of the package. Big, small, I love it all, but don't ruin the surprise. I also agree about too big. I'd prefer to save my big dicks for strippers and keep them away from my vagina and mouth	9
0	I paid $2 delivery from Quality Foods and the groceries were priced the exact same in store like WTF. Get with the times, not everyone actually *can* leave the house and get food.  Like elderly people who are still able to live alone but aren't allowed to drive, and other disabled people. Ugh.  My excuse was I didn't have my license at the time so I had to bet delivery. Now. I just don't want to go out and deal with the bullshit.  Also makes it easier to judge the budget when you can *see* the total in the cart vs the OOOH look cocoa pebbles!	9
0	Er, not sure that 17 is the definition of CP...	9
0	Thongs are not comfortable at all, however, they do make you ass look good in thight clothing.                You do whatever you want, I don't think it's suitable for kids to look like grown ups.	9
0	Okay. They are assholes but they are a specific kind of assholes. They're feminazis. Total wackjobs.	9
0	Genitalia =/= gender, actually.	9
0	My dad was one of the few somewhat eventful vasectomies out there, but it was more that the freezing didn't take at first. The doctor started to cut and his ass went flying off the table. Both the doctor and nurse had a deer in headlights look about them. After giving him more freezing everything was fine, and I happily only have one younger sibling.	9
0	Thanks. She's not really speaking to me right now. I blame /u/AlenaBrolxFlami entirely.	9
0	Where did I say I was in the US? I'm British.	9
0	You were pointing out something that didn't need pointing out. The post you replied to was a joke at the ambiguity of _vargas_'s posts, not a comment on gender/identity, etc. You don't need to inject social justice commentary into every conversation you come across.  And the whole SJW movement is not about "caring about marginalized people", it's about the whole victim mentality and claiming women can never be sexist and PoC can never be racist etc. Someone who actually cares about social issues and does something about them is an activist, not a keyboard warrior like yourself.	9
0	Welp, nothing to do but burn your username to the ground and start over.  I'm not sure which is worse, the fact that someone can't get support in TrollY for admitting he made a mistake because it involved someone in TrollX, or that people in real life give a shit about what happens on reddit at all.	9

0	I got mine at age 18, had them on for 5 years. Expensive, often painful, but totally worth it :) one of the nice things about getting them when you're older is that you understand being careful when you eat so you don't pop a bracket, and that means you don't need to worry so much about avoiding foods!	9
0	A good friendship will ultimately benefit you far more than a relationship where both parties aren't as invested as the other.      It sucks now, but it might lead to something great - just not the kind of great you expected at this point.	9
0	I completely agree. I may interpret the original post differently (or at least parts of it) because that's not what I understood it to mean after I read it.	9

0	You're a baby.	9
0	Lol, that's fucking hilarious.	9
0	"Calling someone out" is pointing out what they did wrong when they're denying they did anything wrong.  When they point out what they did wrong to begin with and you use that as an excuse to kick them nonstop, there are a number of different phrases for that.	9

0	And those THIGHS!!!  Does this woman just spend her day doing squats?	9
0	I'm glad you called him out on his sexist shit. But I'm also blown away by the fact that not only did he think that was a legit reason to deduct your grade, but admitted to it over email. It's almost cartoon character level idiocracy. But you're the one with the "problem." Hmmm MMmmmm.	9
0	It would have been more accurate to say "what sex vargas is" and that's probably the best answer for this circumstance.	9
0	OMG that alone would have made me rage! Nothing like a sexist asshole who reverts to age 6 when confronted. I would have loved to point out his behavior directly. "Why are you rolling your eyes? Wouldn't you consider that disrespectful if a student did that you to?"  Good for you for fighting the good fight.	9

0	Not sure what you're meaning by the first comment.     You like what you like.  :)  For me, it def feels different.  Not necessarily better or worse.  I think also the idea that a girl is trusting you to do an act that most women feel is off the table.  Then when she comes from it...that helps too.  :)	9
0	Oooh nice. I might do that, if we can't rekindle our relationship.	9
0	I wish, there was no grant funding or TA positions. They gave no advice on how to pay for it. I thankfully am done but all your kind words really mean a lot. But it's why I'm too tired to fight it. Mostly glad it's over.	9
0	I like how the map in the background says "Assumption Park". Clearly where that awful person lives... How insensitive!	9

0	I thought so too!!! I was so disappointed. Never had sex with him again, and practically ran out of there once he finished.	9
0	That....was actually funny and really on point! They also made a version with no f-bombs for educational purposes; that's awesome! If I do a sex ed program/lecture/conference again I'll definitely work this in somewhere (with credit to the creator of course).   Thank you for this /u/The_Vork!	9
0	Yeah, those damn people linking the proof!	9
0	does the man one smell different or something? why does this exist?	9
0	Yeah - its just the mortgage payment split between the two of us is a lot.	9
0	Yep. OP's mom sounds like a textbook case.	9
0	Notice how everyone here wants to see it, even though they probably didn't care before? Sounds like good marketing (and blown way out of proportion).	9
0	Link to the disproved bits?	9
0	Maybe it's more sweat/water resistant? Or there's nothing different about it at all and they're just jumping aboard the "for men" train.	9

And because of the way they position the air holes, a smaller cup can hold more.  You can also check out [Menstrual Cup Forums](http://menstrual-cups.livejournal.com/) to compare different brands and sizes.	9
0	UGH SAME. I'm still on Season 10 and one of the yogis I follow on Instagram posted a blatant spoiler. :( Totally ruined.	9
0	I dunno, does it have a label that says something like "Safe (and pleasurable) to rub on your junk!"? Maybe that is what makes it"for men". :D	9
0	&gt;  Unique genomes can also be found in cancerous tumors  It's these kinds of absurdist arguments that hurt the Pro-Choice side.  As far as determining when personhood begins, the legal determination has been about when a baby can (arguably) survive outside the womb.  And why are you even arguing with me? I was giving reasons for why abortion makes sense legally and why the Pro-Life person OP mention was wrong? T.T	9

0	Well, the only true indicator of health is speaking to a doctor. BMI isn't good for determining overall health... most Olympic athletes have a BMI that tells them they're obese! For me, gaining a few pounds was great for my health, but everything is relative. There are lots of ways to guage whether you're too skinny, or just naturally trim. For example, my ribs used to be extremely visible, but now they have some nice padding. I also have more energy, get less foot cramps, and feel warmer! 105 can mean very different things for different people. Everyone has their ideal weight.	9
0	D: I have a polyp right at the bottom of the uterus but so far all it has caused me was pain if it is poked wrong. At least I am assuming that's what that is cause it's not the same as cervix poking pain. Are they supposed to hurt? What is the surgery like?	9
0	You know when you will be proposed to? Or am I reading that wrong? lol	9
0	I'm not suggesting you're committing sexual harrassment, not at all!  Men are generally pretty cautious these days to do with almost anything they do can result in someone yelling "RAPE!"	9
0	Change your name to OK_Stumpy	9
0	A fetus is genetically a human. A sperm or an egg is both not a person genetically or will ever become a person except through your labor. In this way a sperm and egg are not human as they are genetically 1/2 a person and are not capable of forming a person by themselves. A fetus just needs to stay where it is, a sperm and egg both require some action on part of either parent in order for a life to form.  So no, there is nothing wrong with masturbation because sperm is not due the same rights as a real person.	9
0	It's a 12-point gap system. They literally say it has to be 10.00 in higher. Totally bullshite!	9

0	When you have to resort to childish retorts like "are so," this conversation is not productive.	9
0	A friend of mine has a BMI of like 15-17, but she eats waaaaaay more than I do. She also does long distance running, weightlifting, and rock climbing, so she's kind of a beast. Everyone always comments that she needs to gain weight, and she's been trying like crazy for years to gain, but unfortunately she has the metabolism of a hummingbird.  edit: we're both 5' 7", I'm at around 125-130lbs and she's at 105lbs-ish.	9

0	Feminism is about equality, but apparently this new hateful strain has taken root recently, and I am more than a little alarmed. I only see stories about it online or in videos, but I'm in my 30s and not really directly interacting with any women's studies majors. So I have no idea how pervasive it truly is. I try to assume what I see online is half a state of over-enthusiasm due to just learning about certain issues and half is fake posts made by trolls. I guess time will tell if it's a twitch or full pendulum swing.	9
0	Well, unless what you intended to produce is bullying.	9

0	This may be jerky of me, but I posted a snarky status about how I was safe, and also listed a bunch of other past natural disasters that I survived through (that were nowhere near me).

0	And also are not drums. They are an aid to learning to play drums, not drums themselves. When you listen to a band the drummer is not playing on practice pads.   You really are the one who says no apartment dweller should learn an instrument. How freaking sad for your neighbors.	9

0	If you're (both) not into having a 'disciplinary' relationship, it's hella weird.	9
0	So just read the entire thread. No one is going to jump on the "snorted MJ and died" bit? I mean, Taylor Swift is being awesome but really, that isn't how the drug works. If you managed to snort marajuana you probably would die, its called choking.	9
0	Yeah mines a month late...I had one day of spotting and have consumed an inhumane amount of coco pops in the last 3 days D:  Fucking hormones!	9
0	Calling someone I'm getting sexual with "Daddy" is so disgusting to me.  That's what I called my dad when I was a kid!  I don't understand how anyone with a good OR bad relationship with their father would be turned on by that.  I mean if it's good, it just reminds you of your dad and you're like ew.  And if it's bad, it reminds you of a dude you hate and you're like ew.  At least that's the logic in my head.  Each to the own, but yeah, that's not for me.	9
0	Exactly! I've always found it funny how these MRA guys go on and on about how tough and masculine they are when they are so easily threatened. If they were really so tough it wouldn't matter what we do but any time women are portrayed as something other than doormats they get nervous.	9

0	I don't know if I'd want to give my nudes to google tho. There is probably a clause on their EULA that says "We own everything that you put on google forever". Maybe as a last resort?	9

0	Does that mean being a pedo would help in regards to calling someone 'baby' then? Baby is a super weird thing to call someone you're having sex with when you think about it....	9
0	As long as there's the association between the phrase and the person / thing (not just as a name) yeah.  It's super weird, but it becomes less weird if it gets you off. Different strokes for different folks.	9
0	A woman that can't find sex? Yeah, like that exists.	9
0	Because if you don't put a trigger warning on any idea people may not like, they decide it's hate speech.  God, I used to get so angry when people would say stuff like that and get worried about the "PC police." Social awareness has become a caricature of itself, it's fucked up.	9

0	I love this sub, but sometimes it does have it's /r/tumblrinaction moments	9
0	I know all of that. But without a signed document showing both parties agree to the stipulations, the extent of the license IS up for interpretation. Hence, the reason for lawyers and judges. Personally, I'm sure she's got a pretty strong case, especially given the emergence of revenge porn laws, but precedent IS lacking. That's why I called out knightofseashells without using absolute terms. That's how the law works.	9
0	It's because it's mad max. Most definitely. I haven't seen the originals myself so I can't speak about his character.   Edit: I'm not saying that its a valid reason but that's probably why they chose to get mad over this movie in particular.	9

0	Oh, cool.  I didn't even know it was out yet.	9
0	See this is why southern european countries are in the financial mess they are in and why I can never seem to get anyone from the Madrid, Valencia, Barcelona or some other office on the phone.

0	I would be thoroughly tempted to sacrifice a cup of coffee onto his lap.	9
0	Perhaps.  I go to a school with a very large and very loud presence of people I WOULD consider SJW, and frankly by the end of the school year (aka right now) literally anything social-justicey makes me exit a conversation, even though a majority of people really just want positive change.  It really only takes a few loud people who take things too far to make everyone look bad.	9

0	Oh, dude, coloring is cathartic as hell.  I used to do it at work in between 911 calls.  My sister did it all through medical school.  You just zone out and make things pretty.	9
0	Why *I* decided to "stick my nose into something that's not my business?!?"  Listen to yourself.	9
0	Yeah... I'm not going to bring that into this conversation.	9
0	Yes, it's a different level of joking and I acknowledged this - but neither is good. Nobody should have to be poked fun at because of their gender, because life is not Suffering Olympics and all of those jokes are not good in one way or the other.   You should have the right to be whoever you want to be, but I'm not going to start a joke hierarchy. Different people have different problems, and some cishet person may have problems that are "worse" or "bigger" than yours. Doesn't mean they get to poke fun at you.	9
0	Yeah I sent that video to the health teacher at my old high school, so hopefully a whole bunch of teenagers will see it and learn a thing or two	9
0	Problems that come from being a part of a marginalized group are part of what contributes to an individually difficult life. And trust me, I know about being part of a group that society punches down upon.	9
0	I was accidentally playing Metallica in the background when I watched this. Very confusing, but it made things much better.	9
0	I am perfectly fine with what I did. You just showed up out of nowhere.	9
0	If you don't feel like continuing the conversation, I'll cease it.  It seems like we have two different approaches to life. I look at everything through the individualism prism. To me, an individual is more valuable than a group as a whole.	9
0	Actually I love it, and I love round butts too. I'm truly a buttman.   But reading OP's description and seeing her gif I'm like "Hehe, you nasty!!"	9
0	Go read the other side of it again.  She said he wasn't a bad guy, just fucked up and she still considered them friends.  This wasn't your call to make, it was hers.  You took that out of her hands by drama-bombing the entire thing.  &gt; I have this handled just fine  Fucking over strangers on the Internet?  Seriously, aside from the original issue, the hypocrisy here astounds me.	9
0	Eeeh. I agree with what you're saying, but if you search on the MRA sub for Mad Max and poke through the posts there are some that don't fall too far from what this article is saying.  Edit: It has been super interesting watching this comment and the one I made below have wild swings in points. It's not my fault these people said what they said.	9
0	I suddenly need to watch this show. Only I can't let my boyfriend see. Cause he's going to think that I think he's gay-ish.	9
0	Haha ok ok I understand. Chill out fellow troll, I never meant for my original post to be so offensive. I was just, um, trolling?   But seriously I love all the dirty lil details of trollx and broness of trolly, that's why I subscribe to them both. I'm not judging anyone!!! Sorry if my original post was misread/mistaken as me hating on OP. Just imagine a sassy black woman saying "Girl, you nasty!"	9
0	I don't know who is worse MRAs or Triggering-Tumbleristas....     It's the MRAs. Mainly because they're always reacting to the TTs and taking it up a notch.	9
0	How does it work, then? Two people agree that they like hurting and and being hurt, they decide to explore those desires, and a sexual dynamic is born. Doesn't really seem all that complicated to me.  The dynamic doesn't magically become healthy just because both parties share complementary unhealthy inclinations.  Edit: All this said, people engage in unhealthy behavior all the time, for fun and thrills and whatnot, often with no lasting harm done. I really have no problem with that. But I do think it's kind of silly to pretend that things like sadism and masochism are totally normal.	9
0	sounds like a great reason to have a 15 minute bathroom break.	9
0	I judge her as an adult too and she's a pretty shit adult. :/	9
0	It's a dangerous hippocracy to point out.  TBH, MRAs can be pretty great feminist allies if we took the time to cultivate friendships instead of rivalries.	9
0	you didn't need to say it.  It was unnecessary.	9
0	Please look at usernames before you reply, else you end up looking silly like you just did.  I'm not the OP and I'm not a guy. Also, Jesus, WHY do people around here feel the need to look so hard for meaning in statements that aren't meant as anything other than what they state?	9
0	"He made me do it."	9
0	Yeah, a lot of people think I'm taller than I am and I'm short.  I have no idea why, I never wear heels.  I think it's mainly confidence.	9
0	That would be the reasonable answer...	9
0	I don't know, I thought ROK was an MRA/MGTOW/TRP type site. "Manosphere" sorts of things.  Then again, I guess I'm not that well-versed on the minute distinctions.	9
0	I think we're just gonna have to agree to disagree here, as is always the case when this subject comes up.	9
0	Redpill and MRA have so much overlap that its essentially the same. Anyone subbed to redpill is also subbed to mens rights and vice versa.  They literally both have 111,000 subscribers. They might have made it a rule that any RoK stuff gets posted in redpill instead.  Also search the acronym RoK, there is some stuff.	9
0	MRA? Also this makes my blood boil.	9
0	Well said, thank you	9
0	The very basis of everything I've been claiming is that you weren't; that what you were doing was wrong.	9
0	You "came in just like that" too, you know.  Seriously, other people exist.  And "submit" is not an argument.	9
0	I wanna be Master Blaster!	9
0	Do you want to fail your final? Because that's how you fail it. Ive had a problem with extreme procrastination over the years but I swore to myself that this finals season would be different. I would do my studying in uncomfortable places, staying off the Internet as much I could and getting enough sleep. Basically, I managed my schedule efficiently and maximized it. Everything worked out and I aced my finals and this was my post finals dinner to pat myself on the back.... [The aforementioned awesome dinner](http://i.imgur.com/cztSwku.png)	9
0	The posts I was seeing boiled down to "I'm not seeing this since it's been injected with feminism." Especially when talking about Eve Ensler's involvement.  I'm not going to link to them because I don't want to bring that drama here or punt it over there, but I agree with you that there were also some level-headed and more temperate comments as well.	9
0	Discussion continues.  I'm just as appalled at your behavior as you were at his.  Except with better reason - he was repentant and came here looking for emotional support while feeling like crap for admittedly fucking up.  You still think it's OK to treat people like you've been.	9
0	How rude. If the situation were different, I might tell his friends about his small dick, but there's too much potential for danger to do that.	9
0	Can women not enjoy a movie if there isn't a strong female lead?	9
0	I think that's kind of what the original image gets across.  So we can assume that OP is admittedly petulant and childish about doing household chores.  No need to high-horse about it.	9
0	I've been treating him just fine, thank you.	9
0	In many issues they are, but not all issues. To be fair, I can see why they are upset at some feminists and feminist organizations, I just think they make the mistake of painting all feminists under that same brush.	9
0	Yes it is.  To "call someone out" on something is to inform them that what they're doing is wrong, when they don't know it is, or refuse to admit it.  OP knew what he did was wrong and admitted it.  You aren't giving him information he needs.  I mean, you *could* take this opportunity to climb on your moral high horse and pronounce judgement, but there really isn't much point aside from making yourself feel better about yourself.  If OP's wife is having a hard time getting him to change, I doubt if reddit will succeed.	9
0	oh ok , was just curious	9
0	I get it but no.  The word Daddy is in my mind related only to my father.  I don't even understand how someone comes to separate the two in their mind.	9
0	Ps. See it in 2D!!	9
0	My and my friends reaction when today when.	9
0	Really! I tend to hate 3D but this had a couple reviews suggesting the 3D added something. I'll probably avoid anyway.	9
0	the "middle ground" approach doesn't always work my friend, sometimes people are just plain wrong	9
0	If you want anyone to take you seriously, you do. Opinions are garbage without supporting evidence. For example, I think it was wrong of you to link my post to hers because it served to exacerbate things between us, not help them. See? Opinion (Wrong of you to do that) + Resulting Evidence (It exacerbated things between us) = Valid Argument. I feel like this didn't need explaining but there it is. It's like I'm talking to a brick wall. Anyway, that's the last I'm going to comment on the matter. You win.	9
0	It'd be interesting to see a different perspective but dear god make it be any other character than River Song. At least for me.	9
0	&gt;Babe: Pig in the City  That movie always struck me as somewhat too violent. lolo	9
0	This had made me want to go back and watch all the Mad Max films.  But seriously, do I need to understand the back story, or can I start with this one?	9
0	Still awkward as hell though, am I right? Not a pleasant experience for all involved.	9
0	I know, right? I read all these guys complaining about pre-op transwomen not telling them about them having penises (which is dangerous for them), but how many times have any of you hooked up with some cute guy in a bar only to discover he had a little lollipop for a dick?   How many times do we hear them talk about how "5 inches is average", but then you hear them talk about how a woman should always shave?  Ugh... I need a drink. Small dick men make me so angry.	9
0	As someone who can't stand body hair, especially pubic hair, I sympathize with his feelings. Getting surprised with a full bush is not pleasant (guy or girl). His manner of vocalizing this could certainly has some work. Also I don't think the size of his dick discredits him from having opinions/preference about public hair... No shame in having a small dick. Not like it's his fault.	9
0	Really?? Downvoted because I think it's ok for anyone to have a preference on pubic hair and that it's not ok to shame someone based on their genitals?? What the hell ladies?	9
0	"That's cool.  I forgot to ask, how did his gender reassignment surgery go?"  What now?!	9
0	Dang dude I hope you were using "in jest" in jest	9
0	I did this! Totally failed that physics final that was 35% of my grade. Like "HOLY SHIT I FUCKED UP!" kinda fail. Made a B- in the class... I don't understand college math...	9
0	Isn't "men's rights activist" another subcategory of SJW?	9
0	I was about to comment on how stupid that title was and make a remark on my annoyance, then i noticed what sub i was looking at. Well played.	9
0	I really don't think anyone is boycotting this movie. But I see everyone is already having a field day with this so not much point trying to find out whats actually happening, lets just ride the hate train.	9
0	Not really.  Just means my tummy is flatter so I might not need the Spanx for the spring mess dinner at my husband's squadron I'm happy either way	9
0	Actually that's the best way to lose weight.  Keeps from rebounding.  For me, it's not about the weight loss it's more about the toning up the muscle.  I at a heather 135 right now and it's mostly muscle, but I still fighting the stomach flop/diastisis recti from my pregnancies.	9
0	Well, what's #4?  And what's a "jakers"?	9
0	sad "white man" is like a curse word now. downvoted to hell.  was just sincere question. nevermind	9
0	that makes one of you apparently , danke !	9
0	Why not?  Why should we waste a night on someone who not only won't satisfy us sexually *by default*, but who's so selfish that he doesn't even care about letting us choose whether to sleep with someone like him or not?	9
0	&gt; No shame in having a small dick. Not like it's his fault.  Shame? I don't know, that's kind of personal. But it's certainly much more important than whether a woman is shaved or not.	9
0	took me a minute , but i assume you mean by TRP is "the red pill". i look at that sub also. also r/guns , r/djent , r/imgoingtohellforthis . theres nothing wrong with speaking on mens issues and such. i think TRP is probably equivalent to twox , shitty , where the loudest idiots wins.  i am pro white and pro male , but I've rarely found anything cringe worthy in trollx so far. whereas everything on twox is cringe. just embarrassing to all genders.  this place is just more real and honest , pleasant to browse and the occasional real truthful laugh.	9
0	well , i don't know if you even looked at the GIF , but it is someone drinking infinite liquor , as if its so shitty that they must get wasted to even stand being there. that combined with the title is why i asked.  whatever though , next	9
0	Big wongs make a wife  Dunno	9
0	"white men" was in the title , an not needed detail put there. i asked the OP , and they replied with direct answer. so why you are going on is beyond me. sorry to be rude but I'm going to ignore you	9
0	Guy here too; definitely considering buying a ticket and skipping the movie.	9
0	jah buddy , don't take it personal. i would have down voted you for identifying as that too , unless you were making sense. the text does not show the eyes. the eyes are what you need to determine truth from idealogical blindness. at least i think anyway	9
0	You're right about the title. "Hobby Lobby" wouldn't break the character limit, and "getting my shopping on" sounds stupid.	9
0	Uncle Tom?  Really?  Dafuq?	9
0	The Mad Max movies are like Star Wars. Sure there's adventure and action and explosions, but the worlds they build and the characters that live in them will be what stays with you long after.	9
0	Numbing the throat to kill the gag reflex	9
0	Neither am I but i saw it imax and it was one of the best movies that i have seen to make such good use of the format. Awesome action, brilliant sound design, cool filming and decent characters. Gets started immediatly and got me hooked for the whole show. Im not a big post apocolyptic world fan, but now i wanna get stuck into the universe. The art style of the world was pretty sweet.	9
0	MRAs != Red Pill! They are not the same thing.   MRA accept that there are societal differences and inequalities for BOTH genders and try to point out or solve inequalities that men face in circumstances of law and life.   A good example of something that would cause an MRA rage is Halle Berry complaining about paying her ex husband alimony.   http://madamenoire.com/485548/halle-berrys-ex-claims-get-job-husband/  also this recent gem that was posted today:   http://sockdo.blogspot.com/2015/05/outrage-over-naked-lady-ad-on-bus-lot.html	9
0	Most of Reddit hates this sub, including me. I'm only here because /r/titlegore	9
0	it was a tech conference , what were you expecting a looottt of black men? lol.  forget i said anything , was just curious is all.   tschüss	9
0	[This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0E77TdYnY)	9
0	Sounds like someone needs to experience child birth since it ain't no thang. I mean if guys can get up after getting kicked in the balls, giving birth should have this guy doing backflips down the hall.	9
0	&gt; No shame in having a small dick.  Yes there is.  This thread is a clear indication of that	9
0	Well, I was having a decent night before I found this thread.  Thanks for reminding me that because I have a small dick I'm worthless and should just kill myself	9
0	What is it women thinking they can't ask a random cute guy on a date? Men have been asking random cute girls on dates forever and many have dealt with the rejection as well. Lets face it - girls who think they cannot ask a guy out are basically a bunch of cowards because they fear the guy might say no and they'll actually for once in their life know what is a normal day in the life of an average man	9
0	Lol so much butthurt in these comments..	9
0	Well, it would be dangerous for her if she said that out loud in the bar to his friends. Have some empathy.	9
0	also this is my first submission here so hi everyone, thank you for making me laugh regularly &lt;3	9
0	I would have said a witty one liner to him about it and embarrassed himself in front of his friends. What a jerk.	9
0	But it's a group of men and women killing a group of warlords and their minions, and they kill because they are attacked first. It would be like if a group of men and women were fighting Nazis in Germany during WWII. It's not really a gender thing as much as it's just that the dictator has an army, and typically that only includes men.	9
0	What? No, legally Blonde can't pass. She spends half the movie talking about her stupid ex.	9
0	I just don't know why things that could be pictures are posted as gifs :/	9
0	Yeah, there's one part where the 3D is forced and it takes you out of the experience	9
0	For me I hated her little smug 'Sweetie' comments and things like that. She worked as part of the two parter she was in, but after that she got on my nerves. She's worse than Madame Vastra and Jenny(Who are only saved because Strax is funny).	9
0	I do my best to never gawk but sometimes you just see someone so attractive you forget your social responsibilities.  ):	9
0	I have found that the bigger the jerk, the smaller the dick. Perhaps it's how they compensate for it. Please tell me I'm not the only one...	9
0	I haven't read it but can state with confidence it is not the greatest book of all time.	9
0	Oh I agree, hence why I said a lot of pleasure can be derived from the small penis.	9
0	That's good! But others may not feel the same - hopefully you can lead by your example. I was just explaining the rancor since you asked.	9
0	Hmm. I doubt he would object to repeated practice lol	9
0	How is it monday? Its saturday?	9
0	How is it monday? Its saturday?	9
0	Explain to me why you need to send your BF's dick pic to your BF... or to anybody.	9
0	and a pretty big circle from my experience ;-;	9
0	That's dishonest. Aren't you telling him, "I love you" while you're planning to break up with him?	9
0	It's horrible to be strung along, too. What's he expecting out of your next meeting?	9
0	Oh I got it...last night.  to the point where I couldn't walk for a solid hour after.    Weee	9
0	...Nah. The word is absolutely the important part. Otherwise you'd choose a different fucking word. It's father/daughter roleplay, and it's gross. I'll judge them all I want, like I judge people who like getting shat or vomited on.  edit: lol women	9
0	I appreciate the intent, but I'm a little uncomfortable with a man telling me which boys I do and do not want to date.  What about him sending the message to the boys who think this instead? Then everybody wins.	9
0	It's a healthy thing that you can recognise guilt. If you're concerned about how he'll feel, come clean as soon as you can. Good luck.	9
0	I don't get why people are getting so upset here. The dude clearly was shaming women with pubic hair (I've personally heard drunken rantings of a guy who said this) and OP simply heard that he has a penis on the small side, and she is just tickled by the irony that HE is JUDGING women when he himself is not "perfect" and clearly OP's friend was no satisfied with his abilities, small dick or no.	9
0	thank you!&lt;3 opie's gonna be ready to be picked up soon, i'm ready to go get him! &amp; we started jasmine on her thyroid meds this morning &amp; a facebook friend said they went through the same thing with their dog &amp; it didn't take long at all for them to get to feeling back to normal. i'm excited, i don't like my little girl to be all sad &amp; sleepy &amp; mopey!	9
0	i actually have to take pm the same meds as jasmine, just as at a much higher dose lol  what kind of dog do you have? jasmine's full grown at a whopping 49lbs lol we call her our "pocket boxer"	9
0	Welp that's kind of funny in a morbid sort of way. Humboldt is an 85 lb German Shepherd puppy! He thinks he's a human though	9
0	To be fair, when you read most of their complaints, it becomes obvious that they probably did not see the movie *at all*.	9
0	lol right? i keep saying "don't worry, i've been there!" your baby is already bigger than both of mine! our "big" boy is around 70 haha	9
0	DADDY LITERALLY MEANS FATHER  DADDY CONNOTES FATHER  DADDY IMPLIES FATHER  IF THEY DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THESE CONNOTATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS  THEY WOULD NOT USE A WORD FOR "FATHER"  Clear enough?	9
0	Really?  You thought women didn't mock small dicks?  What world do you live in?	9
0	Like anything it's up to writer to find their own style. There aren't really many hard and fast rules to writing outside grammar.	9
0	Afraid to say something, all my karma is from this subreddit. Trollx give it, trollx take it away. In all honestly, the guy is a bellend. I don't know how penis size comes into it but i'm not gonna loose sleep over it. Shit happens, people are always going to judge you in life. Gonna keep moving my dudes.	9
0	Thanks for this.  I've been worried about trying one.	9
0	I will politely disagree with you. That's about it. I think we won't come to an agreement here.	9
0	Good luck with your situation. I'm outta here. Your sisters here are savages. "Please be respectful"? I wish.	9
0	Came here to ask this.	9
0	I'm not sure (not the person who suggested it) but the soft cup is softer and disposable.  Soft cup is very different from a regular menstrual cup, so personally I would say you should just jump in with a menstrual cup if that's what you want to use. I've heard of people having issues with the soft cup and not the diva cup, so I would hate for you to be turned off by soft cup issues when its very possible you won't have those issues with a diva cup.    But you can also just try it because it's cool and apparently you can have sex while wearing soft cup!	9
0	I share these mutual feels. I spent a year in college and made two friends. The pain is real.	9
0	Wow, so mad just because you assumed something and fucked up. I'm over this, been over it since about 5 minutes after posting, but you seem to be stuck on this for some reason. Let it goooo~	9
0	Why would you think that?  Making fun of small dicks is encouraged among women and society in general	9
0	This is exactly how I feel, but with stuff like this:  https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/forbidden-stars-showcase/  Or this:  https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/star-wars-imperial-assault-showcase/  Or this:  https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/star-wars-armada-showcase/  Ughhhh mortgage why car trouble whyyy	9
0	Most people?  Half of the people here are perfectly fine with it and essentially saying small guys are worthless.  The one's who are angry are just women trying to be politically correct.  They aren't angry and depressed the same way I am because it doesn't affect them like it affects me.  This thread ruined any happiness and relief I got from just finishing the semester	9
0	I am *not* going to apologise for calling incest fetish gross.	9
0	:)  I can assure you that they've all tried and tested methods, with successes in even surprisingly small cities.   Good luck. And remember in the mean time that you have all of us Trolls.	9
0	"Ammunition"?.... Not to nitpick but that sounds a lot like revenge porn. Your mom should be courteous and delete it permanently. She's still cool as hell though.	9
0	And if I want something, that someone else wants me to want I can't want it?  Wow that sentence confused me	9
0	That's cool and all that your parents got a good laugh out of this but as a guy, I would be mortified and feel quite insecure knowing my penis was the subject of an unauthorized someone's laughter no matter how benign it is when they weren't supposed to get the pic. I can't imagine how my parents would react to the reverse situation with a smiley on my GF's boobs or vagina or how she would feel about it.	9
0	Pissing the bed is glamours? I'm sorry, I strongly disagree and I'm fairly confident anyone who calls that book glamours has never actually read it. TFiOS shows teenagers with cancer as human beings with their own lives and flaws rather than saints and martyrs like people in life often do.	9
0	You're a champ! You got this girl! Show Mon.. err Saturday who's the boss! And remember tonight you can cuddle with Ben and Jerry and Netflix they're always up for the Job!	9
0	I could maybe get why. They lived through some hellish shit, a average day to you may be a beautiful, and more importantly, peaceful day for them.	9
0	Oh sure, but I get it. Their formative years were filled with rocket attacks, rationing, constant death and destruction on a scale the world hasn't seen since. Then after that came reconstruction and the looming threat of nuclear annihilation, then still later Northern Ireland's fight for independence and once again there was fighting right at their doorstep. Most of their life has been filed with a very real sense of looming danger.	9
0	Excuse me, can I just tell you that Privilege is an accusation? It carries the automatic connotation of being wrongly favored and ignorant. Whether it's true to not doesn't matter. It irritates most people, so if you throw it out there you have to expect blowback.  You may not have heard that before.	9
0	Oh buu-huu. I haven't had any friends in over a decade now. Don't worry, you'll get used to it.	9
0	No, but I wouldn't take it as a command but rather as a suggestion. Enjoy what you have now because tomorrow the peace could be broken and everything you hold dear could be up in flames. That life's too fleeting to not appreciate every day you have. Don't look at them as just old farts babbling about how good you have it but as survivors of some great trauma who are trying to impart wisdom in perhaps not the most effective way.	9
0	Drunk you is the real MVP.	9
0	The way it is approached is super important. "You should smile! It's a beautiful day out!" Is a lot better than just, "you should smile."	9
0	Not at all but you can improve yourself but examining their perspective. After All wisdom is brought about by examining experiences. They don't have to be your own. That's all I'm recommending. Trying to understand their experiences and asking why they would call for you to do anything can teach you not only about who they are but who you could be, should you chose.	9
0	My reaction when you stank.	9
0	Not at all true. Even big boobs only weigh about 2-3 pounds each.	9
0	HIFW you use big words.	9
0	sad thing is you need to wear makeup at work.	9
0	fair enough. Not much i can say to that. Better than wiping mud of ya face i suppose.  I'm a male that's never understood the stripper thing.  Can dance well in any club for free.  Different strokes for different folks.	9
0	Lol on occasion you do, though it's usually when the man is quite old (over 40 or 50). I recall my (generally cool but not perfect) mother complaining about a male work colleague wearing short short that were not tight to the leg and revealed far too much! Apparently she and her colleagues (catering events) felt it was fine to tease him about how gross he was. I think the instance was pretty extreme in terms of the revealingness and the percieved unattractiveness. Totally want to acknowledge that I think you are probably right, just thought you might find the incident amusing.	9
0	Well, you can win by doing what they want.	9
0	Did he have a TelePrompTer hidden somewhere? Amazing he could speak that long without notes.	9
0	That's quite the... artists impression.	9
0	It would really depend upon when and how that conversation came up. Such as: "I'll keep my last name, but the kids can have yours."	9
0	Why? Maybe it's an American thing, i can't think of a situation where it'd be a problem, but maybe i'm making mistakes in my own projects.	9
0	Is it George Clooney?	9
0	They *should* extend that to her both that doesn't mean they will. Their age and experience doesn't mean they've become prime examples of a good person. However, their actions don't negate what can be gained from examining their viewpoint. They've lived through a lot  in their ~70 and probably won't be around much longer. The chance to learn from those experiences will soon slip away.	9
0	They definitely do though.	9
0	Na i understand why they go. I just prefer a chat in an informal way. Not saying you can't dance. Just saying that my idea of dancing is a bit more relaxed. I'de get stressed i had to pay you for fun.	9

0	Yes! It's all about being happy and healthy! I've been on the same road and it gets better with time and taking the time for yourself. Best of luck to you! :)	9
0	Well, I may have judged too swiftly. I'm glad you tried talking with everyone, and it sucks that your friend's wedding is going to be so tense.   But really, I think you calling her "bitch" and "chick" is not doing much for women in general. She's a person. Maybe an idiot person with an unnecessary bad attitude, but those kind of words will get side-eye from me in any situation.	9
0	I've only seen this once by a lady at a bar. I think she'd had too much to drink.	9
0	I first saw this ten years ago on the Internet, and I facepalmed. I still do.	9
0	I'm not trying to hurt feelings, but if saying "present" or "here" first really scares you, please see a doctor. It could be anxiety or even hypoglycemia. Your body does weird things and that's a bit excessive. Please seek help.	9
0	It still sounds dumb. :(	9

0	Sometimes I just get downvoted for being me. I don't quite understand it myself.  Either way, if it's not your face, don't worry so much about it. Can't recall ever telling a woman to "smile, beautiful" unless it was for a photo.	9
0	He's being downvoted for desiring violence over someone showing concern.	9
0	Good call with the hem tape; that can work especially with an all black costume and allow quick adjustments!	9
0	It took us a bit to figure out how to remove the protective layer on it, and we were worried it wasn't going to stick (it's...very old hem tape I found). But it looked good! Might use it on the abaya/dress hem next time as well, I am...really short. Didn't trip, tho!	9
0	While I obviously disagree with you on the point that someone's experiences aren't worth investigating simply because you oppose their attitude or actions (I would make a case for quite the opposite actually) I can at least agree with you that verbal harassment is unacceptable in polite society.	9
0	I personally think it's rude and wrong to desire to burn the faces of people who are concerned for you, but I guess cultural differences and all that.	9
0	That's true. It's one thing to share your life with people whom you consider friends, but it's another to send them a request and then litter their wall with seemingly purposeful hashtag/facebook buzzwords rather than just sharing their day..	9
0	She has no obligation (nor does anyone else) to see things from their perspective but doing so provides an opportunity to exercise her capacity for empathy which pays dividends is all aspects of life. Being able to empathise with those you oppose or in this case find offensive/disagreeable is an important life skill. Sun Tzu straight up says it's mandatory to be a successful strategist or leader.	9
0	Really? The victim card?  I haven't blamed anyone. I'm just heathy and people can't accept that.	9
0	You're talking to a guy who is in a pretty unprivileged position (unemployment) about male (his) privilege. I think that's kind of insensitive to do in the first place, though his response was absolutely inappropriate.	9
0	I'm healthy and obese.   And beautiful.   Point proven wrong.	9
0	Actually, Monkey, the articles pointed at me over 20 times don't have anything to do with my individual health profile which has been studied by doctors.   You don't want to accept that.	9
0	We're talking in circles.	9
0	And I think you're a decent person who deserves to post on the internet just to make people feel shitty about themselves.    Oh, no, I don't.   Guess you don't exist?	9
0	There is no arguing with you that will change your mind. Why should I spend the energy?	9
0	i truly believe that i am not a good person. i also happen to make decent money for someone my age. ive made money off people because they were too dumb to realize what i was doing.   i still tip hairdressers $10-$20 or give a waitress a decent tip after a meal. i dont think tipping makes you a good person.  its the intention of the kid. he took the $5 because he knew he could get away with it.  if the kid was presented with a similar situation but with $5,000 would he still do it?	9
0	A quick glance through your history shows that you are a straight Navy wife. I'm an anti-military lesbian. Totally different cultural norms there.   I'm saying that I feel downtowns were justified for unnecessary violent feelings. I also feel that you aren't the Reddit police and people are free to downvote even if you disagree with them.	9
0	I'm curious, in your opinion is there any way that a woman could choose to take on her husband's name such that it is, in fact, feminist of them to have done so?	9
0	That is insane. I understand if you personally choose to not be addressed that way, but to actually be offended when someone else refers to themselves as Mr and Mrs Lastname makes absolutely no sense.	9
0	If you think of marriage as a transfer of goods, I don't know why you ladies are getting married. A marriage is a union between two people, joining them as family to each other for life.	9
0	ITT: making a choice, regardless of what that choice is, is a feminist act.	9
0	...yes? We definitely do, that's a thing.	9
0	So how do you guys divide up the amount of time you share ownership of his balls?	9
0	As someone who's worked in public schools; I can tell you they just keep adding them on.  Here's a weird idea: Why don't sons take their father's last name and daughters take their mothers? Maybe make the other parent's name their middle name or something; and the family is referred to as the hyphenated form.	9
0	I have a hyphenated middle name. If I ever get married I will probably hyphenate my last name. IT WOULD BE HYPHEN-TASTIC.	9
0	That's kind of what's happened with us. I haven't changed anything officially yet (immigration stuff) but I like to use both. I really like my surname !	9
0	A better way to phrase it:  A Freudian slip is when you mean one thing but you fuck your mother.	9
0	I'm not really sure if I'm cool with my severe and debilitating mental illness being reduced to a cutesy joke name for trivia night.   By which I mean I'm totally not cool with it.	9
0	I feels you! Hilarious post!	9
0	When I was an undergraduate and needed something ironed I'd do cutesy puppy eyes at the nearest woman and helplessly flail around with the iron in front of her until she stepped in and did it for me.  I'm actually competent and quick at ironing, I just prefer making cheery small talk while watching someone else to actually doing it.   In my defence, I was cute enough to get away with it and that doesn't last forever. Make hay while the sun shines and all that.  edit: Still got it! Did bwinky bwinky eyelash fluttering at wife, persuaded her to wash my duvet cover.	9
0	But I'm not saying she has to do anything, I'm saying how I would try and take the situation and then suggesting it may be worth a shot for herself. I was just trying to have a conversation. For me this was just as much a excisersie to put myself in her shoes. I would like to think that were I in her situation I would try to at least make it somewhat constructive.	9
0	You're seriously overstating dick drawing if you think that the attitude spills over into different contexts and is uncontrollable.	9
0	Yep, advice animals is a good place to start	9
0	My sister and I are super close. I'm happily married, but when she decides to have a baby, I'm seriously going to consider a second kid so that we can raise the babies together.	9
0	Hey I made a post like that a while ago! Take a stand! Don't delete your account. laugh at his face and tell him to get fucked.  I reply to everything he writes to me with this:  http://i.imgur.com/jhRiEwZ.gif	9
0	I see it more as guys commenting	9
0	But obviously they are not gonna be drawing dicks on everything in ‛the real world'	9
0	Sorry. I can't help you there. :(	9
0	I don't draw them often, but when I do the reason is very simple: it annoys people and provokes a reaction. I'm surprised that answer didn't come up in the professors story (or it did and she didn't include it since it didn't help the story).   Thinking back to high-school, we pretty much just drew boobs, stick figures and cats. More fun than dicks with similar reactions. I didn't really see people drawing dicks on things until I came to North America.	9
0	And yet eating sterilized dirt is still disgusting. The fact that you're making excuses for another disgusting behaviour, and are getting angry about it, makes me suspicious. Either you are a fetishist (ew), or a SJW (ugh). Either way, you need to take yourself less seriously.	9
0	Stop being such a normie	9
0	I think that just means you like each other and won't be sleeping with anyone else, but want to take it slowly and not rush into it? I know I can get scared when I start dating someone especially if I really like them, sometimes in the first few months it's nice to just enjoy being with each other without a load of pressure, as long as you know they want to be in a relationship with you eventually but not rush into anything mega serious right at the beginning, if they don't want a relationship at all at any point, that's when you're in trouble.	9
0	this may not help that much.... but have an upvote =)   glad that douche is gone.. on behalf of the male population.  I am sorry.  some of us are douchebags but not all of us are.. I hope you find someone you can truly connect to.  happy hunting! =p	9

0	I had a half swollen eye last week as well due to testing some new make up work sent me. Sucks so much. Have you seen an optometrist? Mine gave me some great thingy and it cleared in 3 days!	9
0	When wasn't there a choice? Because, I'm pretty sure there wasn't a law that forbade women from keeping their name that had to be overturned, plus there is a long history of women who kept their family name. If feminism = choices, I'd rather choose liberation, thanks.	9
0	This conspiracy goes deeper than I even imagined. but either way, who cares. My last bf was a little over 6" (before we measured I thought he was over 7" at least) and he was plenty long enough. People are all different it's all relative if one is too short or loose or whatever. Plus girls absolutely cannot accurately judge a guys dick size without measuring. Plus I read somewhere that because guys usually look down at their dicks it looks smaller to them than it actually is!!! Crazy.	9
0	&gt; But why do straight guys draw dicks?  Because people keep asking this question.	9
0	Honestly, birthdays aren't as important to people after a certain age. I really don't want to have to be around for the birthday for everyone I know (or even most family) just because birthday. They happen every single year. *shrug*	9

0	While this isn't popular among a younger generation, I always try to respect the traditions of whoever is having me over.  For example, I might not agree with another religion, but if someone asked me to take my shoes off at the door of a temple I would.   You can always have different rules in your own home :)   I'm also assuming some level of context here- if they are telling you this as though you should be agreeing with them, well, react accordingly. But if it's general advice for where to sit, especially in more traditional settings, it's still true.	9
0	You can even have it on consecutive days, maybe. Just not the same day if that's not your thing!	9
0	No, we have separate beds for comfort reasons.	9

0	I can't say most girls actively prefer small dicks, but at the same time I think many find that better that something that would hit your cervix. (Ow)  In the end, if you read the comments, it's all about how you use the size you have. I've had good sex with a guy with a *very* small member, and it never was a problem.	9
0	Stop pretending that it's okay to demonize a group because you pay more attention to asserting revulsion towards the ones that do act on compulsions than helping those that do not.	9
0	All words are invented; I'm just tell you how they are currently used in the community of people who use this particular word.   I'm not a prescriptivist so go ahead and use it however you want.   I'm a descriptivist so I was describing it's common usage.	9
0	It's not a joke, I dislike Jennifer Lawrence enough that I downvote nearly every picture of her I see.	9
0	Thank you for your comment! I was already planning to try for more magazines if I didn't get this one, but hearing this from someone who's on the other side really means something! I just feel vulnerable putting something so personal to me out there :/	9
0	Am I the only one that sees no problem with this? Its just a seat. No one is saying that you're less of a person for not being the male head of the household. They are just saying that this is his seat and not to sit there. Sure, its super traditional but I don't see an issue.	9
0	damn, you look good. and it show's you've got a sense of humor too! the total package going on :)   Do you dress up funny often or was this for a special event? ever been to comic-con?

0	Well, then at least she's getting things done the way she wants 'em done!	9
0	Hahahahahahahaha. Sorry I know it sucks but if I could do this to my gf I would too. What you do is tell him you will get him off in other ways, do a Strip tease, blow him, tell him wait when he is about to burst, say "let's try anal" (if he asks why now tell him you need him inside you no matter what right now), and then get all lubed up, get him lubed up, get just the tip touching, then make a huge wet fart all over his dick and laugh.    He won't bother you for the rest of the week at least.	9
0	Sure, linguistsplaining, since annoyingly explaining word usage is a common characteristic of linguists.   Or tumblrsplaining (if I was actually on tumblr) since explaining oppression is a common thing tumblr people do.   Explaining vaginas is not a common thing trans people do, so the splaining has nothing to do with her being trans.	9

0	I don't know, I think there are a vast number of people in the US who have kids they can't quite afford.   And they get to have children!   Most of the time more than once.    I realize I can't speak to your exact situation, but maybe it's not a question of trying to afford it exactly.   If you two are in agreement that you want a child, go ahead and have one.	9
0	No, unsolicited dick pics are eye rape.  EYE RAPE.  It's very serious.  If your dick pics were not asked for, DO NOT SEND THEM. They are not cute, they are offensive.  Do Not Send.	9
0	The difference is that you can actually tell men that you don't want unsolicited dick pics, and they might actually give a shit.	9

0	It's certainly empowering when you see influential people like that who are unapologetic about being feminists; I still remember professors and speakers who were and are that way and it makes me respect them that much more.	9
0	I guess that is what I am saying, but with more emphasis on the idea of those extra-vocal 'trolls and flamers' reaching a critical mass, where they begin skewing almost all interaction, and repulsing the more moderate.	9
0	I have not.  More nuanced sounds good.  I'll check it out.	9

0	Feel free to read other posts for situations, since people asked.	9
0	One person.  You are talking about something that most women absolutely are deeply offended by, and you are talking about one person.	9
0	Hopefully more nuanced than, I don't know, pushing people that annoy you in front of trains?	9
0	Yes, Urquhart would instead manipulate a chain of obligations and blackmail into causing the person to either jump in front of the train themselves or have a unwitting patsy do it. Or he'd arrange for them to be *driving* the train when it runs over an innocent disabled man, wrecking the opponent from the inside.	9

Sure, they're unusual, but do we really want to start curing "different?"   Am I wrong in that kind of thinking? There are hyper-extreme cases, but that's not the majority that is in question I don't think...

0	Where did she call the people who do that disgusting?  &gt;"Calling someone I'm getting sexual with "Daddy" is so disgusting to me.   The antecedent of "disgusting" here is clearly the act, not the person who enjoys the act. I really don't understand why everyone is getting so hostile and defensive about this shit. Unless there's some other comment I'm missing where she says "UGH PEOPLE WHO DO THAT ARE SO SICK" people need to calm the fuck down....	9
0	Probably cause they are thinking of the extreme cases and not the cases where people decide they have autism and/or use it as an excuse to be bad people	9
0	Really I read that too, and it came across pretty clearly that they *did* know what they were doing and were allowed to get away with it.  You're right Im not a expert, and don't really care to be, but I have heard something of the controversary around the debate of whether it *even exists*. Like I said before, the idea that there's a sudden epidemic is questioned by some. The most basic issue, of course, being what you would define by "normal" social interaction.	9

0	I'm sorry, but I had to remove your post. TrollX is for memes and rage comics, not personal stories/photos. I know you've seen personal photos/stories every so often in the past on TrollX, but they were beginning to become overwhelming. At the behest your fellow TrollXers, the mod team has been removing them with more vigor and frequency.	9

0	We removed that too.	9
0	It's always been a part of the sub rules - there's a directive in the submission text to save personal images for IFF on TwoX. We have made some exceptions in the past.  Its up to you if you want to unsubscribe, but you're hurting yourself and your fellow TrollXers there, not the mods.	9

I guess it doesn't come through here but I was thinking this more in a half funny, half serious conspiratorial tone...like "hey this is a serious issue, but here's a way to deal with it that might be a little fun for you since you had to go through all that." Clearly completely hysterical over here.	9
0	Never said he purposefully disregarded it, but accidentally is still a problem--it makes no difference to your vagina whether the poop covered dick was there intentionally or not. I also didn't say to never forgive him--I just said to make him feel bad, meaning that as soon as he does actually feel bad, OP should then stop making him feel bad and move on.	9
0	Both my husband and my son are on the spectrum. I love them both more than anything.  Seriously, I wouldn't change them if I could.	9
0	I have a strong urge to link a video here but i know im in the wrong subreddit for it...  E: just noticed someone below referenced this video lol. (not the "order that would surprise you" one)	9
0	... And this is one of those /r/tumblrinaction moments on this sub these days.	9
0	really? this has happened to me before on accident and it was fine aka no ER or UTI.	9
0	Wasn't exactly my wording. I was saying "even if all the *insert bad negative things people are saying here* I don't care, still gonna watch it. Other people (read - not me) are saying there's some hidden agenda here meant to feminize men somehow, sneaking in feminist ideals in between explosions. I doubt the director or Charlize have any hidden agenda here. Even if they do I'm confident that I can still enjoy the movie, and if they challenge me with some new ideas I've never imagined, that's ok with me.	9
0	Agreed, but I think you can give someone crap without making them feel like crap, and to be fair he started giving crap first, as it were. Also everyone here is really overestimating my ability to make anyone feel like crap. My teasing is the weakest shit there is.	9
0	I haven't been watching this season, did those fucking dirt bags who ruined the books actually make Ramsay rape Sansa? I hope it wasn't anything like the Jenye Poole fiasco?   So glad I stopped watching.	9
0	He probably didn't bring it up with you because he knew you'd react exactly this way, or because it is such a fleeting thought for him that he doesn't actually think it's a big deal that needs to be discussed with you, which was why he was trying to have a private conversation about it without you.	9
0	Not all guys :(. I'm here and as far as I can tell I'm not a dick (pun intended).   Edit: Welp, shit. At the bottom of the page. You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.	9
0	Fair enough... although you can certainly feel like "oh womp, I really dun goofed" without feeling really miserable. This is also one of those instances where conveying tone would have really helped.	9
0	Sweet, sweet, wonderful closure &lt;3	9
0	Nor am I. I'm a big fan of talking about the issues calmly and honestly. But I'm also a fan of poking fun at people when they deserve it, and that was just the first thing that came to mind. I'm admittedly not the funniest person in the world but I have managed to stay in a very happy and loving 4 1/2 year relationship where we do this kind of lighthearted teasing all the time.	9
0	Nah'mean? And I doubt these people take their own advice.	9
0	I feel this is the point where we don't state our opinions and instead offer support to OP. It's like being ridiculed for feeling unattractive; you know you can't change it, you just need to stop feeling alone. For OP's sake, please delete your comment.  In any case OP, you know we love you. Keep on rocking the world. We've got your back! ;D	9
0	Ahaha Tinkerbell is the representation of a down vote fairy	9
0	That's exactly what I did last night. I felt nauseous after GoT so I needed something to take my mind off of it.	9
0	I couldn't agree more! I have no desire to read books about murderers, watch the news, or generally wallow in how awful the world can be. I can't even listen to NPR anymore; at some point they started spending 75% of their time reporting on war and death. I know that's the reality of the world, but I can't have it shoved down my throat all the time.	9
0	It's sad because you wouldn't say this if you have ever really loved someone.	9

0	Most viewer's objection to this scene is not simply "it should never be shown." Maybe you should actually read some of the discussions about the scene.	9
0	I wasn't invalidating his experiences? I just mean there is a repeated track record for violence towardswomen, specifically ones that do not relate to the story, were not in the books and one that were purposefully changed from consensual into a rape scene.  I don't think that we have to (or should for that matter) stop telling stories about rape and sexual violence, I think it just needs to be done in a better way.	9
0	But vinegar and soap do kill germs.   I mean, it doesn't mean that they kill all germs, but I have never gotten sick from going ass-to-mouth as long as I cleaned out really well beforehand. The risk factor is there. I guess that is why it is sexy?	9
0	I have survived rape.  Tell me about what should be offensive to me.	9
0	bruh.. s/he's giving you genuinely helpful advice, you don't have to accept it but you don't have to act like a teenager either      that gif belongs on /r/shittytumblrgifs lol	9

0	It's been a long time since I've seen it, but after the hour mark isn't there still Ben dead-not-dead Affleck to return after his not-death?	9
0	Bodily fluids? The things that transmit certain diseases (if you have them) and occasionally little pregnancy causing swimmers?  Exchanging these things.	9
0	Fine, I didn't get anything and was surprised that from 1 time ass to vag she landed in the ER. I always douche before anal/sex, maybe that's why I was fine (also other ladies here) honestly didn't get the downvotes since is a honest reaction.    is not like I was saying do it.	9
0	Completely right, new borns can have a stomach pH as high as 5, that isn't a challenge for most bacteria at all.	9
0	My dad is on the spectrum. I would never want another dad. I look for people like him to have in my life.	9
0	I have heard it was tamer than that.	9
0	&gt; douche  Also an option	9
0	I think in this case, it's entirely appropriate.   /high five	9
0	What goes on in behind the scenes of porn?	9
0	&gt;a large inoculation of bad bacteria  Seems like exactly what you'd risk getting in this case.	9
0	Good ol' sexism.	9
0	Shocked, and then refuses to do anything about it.   ETA: I just think it's misplaced in the story. It should have come at the end, when she gets brave and accepts and controls her powers. It's like musical premature ejaculation. She shot her wad too early!	9
0	The vagina is acidic which is why I was talking about acids.	9
0	If you get UTI's every month you should get a more thorough evaluation. That could indicate some other diseases and should be looked into. If you have more than 2 in 6 months it means you could have some other issue going on.	9
0	I feel like douche is appropriate here as they ensure vaginal health lol.	9
0	"...since Ramsay is clearly a bad guy and it's not like when Jaime became a rapist last season."  Jamie pushed Bran Stark out of a tower - straight up attempted child murder - and only seemed worried when Bran didn't immediately die. I don't think rape is that big of stretch for someone like Jamie.   *Edit: not condoning rape, just saying that from a character standpoint Jamie is a man who has done very bad things, therefore his being a baddie and doing more bad things is completely within character.	9

0	Not my situation (have a penis too much for that), but found it on imgur and thought that you trolls would love it.   What a lovely day!	9
0	Are men more often sexist towards women than women are? I'd say yes.   Are generalizations sexist? Also yes.   A lack of respect could easily come from his mother. My grandmother is very sexist against women. It's not uncommon.	9
0	(happy cake day, also yes I agree downvoting doesn't really help a situation at all)	9
0	Haha, my husband has a bit of a problem with this, so we made an agreement to keep his phone in the car while we're on a date. I'm going out to interact with him more, dangit!	9

0	it sounds like an accident. so can everyone who is so quick to judge OP's bf just shut the fuck up already?   glad you're okay, OP.  EDIT: whoops! not OP. I meant the top commenter. Not OP. Sorry OP. didn't mean to refer to you.	9
0	BV is usually the most common presentation I would think due to the "go pee after sex" rule.  Pee doesn't go into the vagina unless there's something wrong.	9
0	Eh... Yes...  Why?	9
0	&gt;It wasn't clear that you were asking how gut bacteria travel to the vagina.  Really? But that was the topic of the discussion.  &gt;As far as I know the bacteria did not travel from your gut and settle into the vagina  I was more asking about the specific case of mixed anal and vaginal sex. Like wouldn't the bacteria from the intestine be able to survive fine when introduced to the vagina because they presumably tolerate the acidic environment (which apparently isn't always the case).	9
0	That does make sense though I'm pretty sure that there are some bacteria that will get there later by surviving stomach acids as the flora isn't always constant.	9
0	Yeah, I'm sure some of it comes through, but there is a difference in gut flora if you came out as a c-section baby.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3110651/   &gt; While CD is necessary in modern obstetrics, the procedure appears to shift a baby's first bacterial community.	9
0	Irrelevant Fun fact: You totally reminded me to take my birth control after forgetting this morning. Thank you.	9
0	Take care of you.	9
0	If you, a woman, has a straight, single, male friend... they want you. At the least, they want to have sex with you. It's as simple as that. Sometimes this applies to non-single guys too!	9
0	And I'm not going to stop criticizing dishonest behavior or anyone who facilitates it.   Do you think the reason people disagree with you is because they've never faced hard decisions in this arena? I've had to make decisions like this before. It wasn't easy and I didn't get what I wanted, but at least I can say I didn't help someone do something cruel to their partner.   It's entirely possible for someone to have gone through similar experiences and still think it's wrong to get or stay involved with a cheater.	9
0	Ugh, he's a jerk for doing that to you!	9
0	The reason they use "daddy" instead of "father" is because there's an element of age play going on as well. It's a kind of substitute for pedophilia.	9
0	I dunno, maybe everyone is taking this a bit too seriously.   Honestly it just seems like a different way to say that he likes her nail polish and kind of flirting. Granted it's a really shitty way to go with that but man it does not seem so extreme as "PEOPLE ARE POLICING MY BODY".	9
0	Typical guy: Horrible timing.	9
0	i used to get sooooo much shit for redditting at the table   but then my boyfriend got his first smartphone and now he is equally guilty	9
0	Too many exams to cherish this age atm.. thanks anyway tho haha	9
0	I am ok with occasional ATM or ATV. On the couple of occasions I've done it, there's been no big issues.	9
0	Dude, spoiler alert! I haven't gotten that far and now I know someone named Ramsay is going to rape Sansa...not cool. :/	9
0	Yeah, people telling skinny me to eat more (when I naturally had a high metabolism but actually loved eating) are what caused me to overeat and then feel bad about it and then make up for it by under-eating. Not a fun experience.	9
0	May I ask why s/he broke up with you? Did you cheat? If you didn't cheat, then I don't see the problem...	9
0	Honestly, if you put some brewers yeast up there and then take a sugar bath, a lot more dudes would love eating the girl out because now she tastes like beer.	9
0	Upvote for Labyrinth reference!	9
0	Meh...I mean I feel like as long as you don't post things that are mean or sexist you'll be okay. It's good to be thoughtful of what you're saying to others!	9
0	Her BF just made a mistake. Everyone's allowed to fuck up sometimes right?  Everyone makes mistakes!	9
0	The only way not to abandon someone who needs you is to help them cheat on their partner?  &gt;Dude, I got to teach someone how to love again.  And this was only possible through the avenue of infidelity?	9
0	I was broken up with last month and I've gotta say, if you can't stop crying at 1AM, it really is super therapeutic to send him a text of a string of "fuck you for..."s. I nearly immediately stopped crying because I got all my thoughts out and knew that he knew most of the ways he'd hurt me. I know it's really hard right now but you're gonna be okay. Just don't bottle anything up. Say what you need to say when you need to say it. And make sure you've got a puppy handy to give you bunches of kisses.	9
0	Oh my fucking god. You...You're my hero.	9
0	She don't have to. I'm not twisting (phone made it twittering lol) her arm. If she has my kind of humor she would appreciate this.	9
0	Really? Sticking live cultures for fermenting beer into your vagina is gross and wouldn't taste good? I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.	9
0	What book was it?	9
0	Honestly, we were all young once and people who are calling him disgusting should a little more understanding about the situation. You two weren't right for each other, and he was dumb enough not to know you were serious. You are probably awesome and he missed out; if he was a total dick about it instead of being upset about breaking him then he's definitely a dick. But if he felt that you didn't trust him or something along those lines, he may not be all that bad.	9
0	I'm 27 and can still pull this shit. I know what I'm about.    Edit: not trying to be rude, had more of a Ron Swanson vibe going in my head.	9
0	Right, but there's yeast in it naturally, so why not supplement it? Just like you do with probiotics for your tummy. Exactly.	9
0	Oh, he's getting a divorce! Or separated.   I also vaguely recall him sorta supporting men's rights a while ago...The wife lives in another state and has their two sons for part of the year.   She also still has access to his bank account, and he is in the military.   So, clearly, a majority of his probs are all on him.	9
0	Agh! Sorry. I meant to include the tag at the beginning. To be fair - the episode prior they made it clear that Ramsay was going to marry her (which has been out for a week) and we all know what an ass wipe he is. Anyway sorry for no spoiler alert.	9
0	I did that today! Now when I open Bacon reader it is all trolls, all the time! :D and a couple other things that I'm still on the fence about.	9
0	A+ level disappointment isn't really just "meh" though... that's definitely more on the side of disliking it than being neutral. I definitely get being tired of the hype though.	9
0	You sure she's not pregnant?	9
0	Glutes for the doods.	9
0	Open for everyone *assuming they can physically perform the task*.  E.g. I'm ALL for lady firefighters, but come on, you have to be able to BE a firefighterto be a firefighter.  Calling for gender equality that will result in hurting the people you will serve isn't the way to go.  (I'm referencing lowering standards for testing to be a firefighter, resulting in letting in more women, resulting in fewer firefighters physically able to carry out tasks expected of a firefighter).	9
0	Surely your sister is the one who will be mad at you for shaving your head?  Aren't you going to be in her bridal party soon?	9
0	Hopefully remotely controlled by real people - still not sure how I feel about robits being in situations where they may need to make decisions on who to save and who to leave behind.	9
0	I just mean, if you were 20lbs lighter, would you then be 10lbs underweight? Who decides what the right weight is? Is it on a bar graph? Scatterplot? Bell curve? Ironic pie chart?	9
0	Places smart people go? I honestly know less men who aren't feminists than who are. (man, 25, Canada)  But I do see men who are clearly not feminists, they are not my crowd. So my advice would be, try meeting some male friends of a friend's feminist SO?	9
0	Ohhhh I'm from Atlanta and really miss it.  It's a great town.  Let me know if you need advice!	9
0	Yeah, probably. I'm mean, we seem to be agreeing, but for some reason this feels like an argument, so just to confirm - trigger warnings are useful, and Reddit mocking them is harmful, as is their misuse elsewhere.	9
0	It's been a good 10 years since I lived there.  Sounds like you're on a budget?  It kinda depends how funky vs. elegant you want to be.  My favorite neighborhoods are Little Five Points, Morningside, Midtown, Avondale, or Decatur.	9
0	to me it's not a great story if it involves such terrible things for entertainment.  The only exception I can give is Law and Order SVU in which they always catch the bad guy and bring him to justice. I love that show for that reason.	9
0	YEah, it is. Nobody wants to see that shit.	9
0	I have never had a girl do that to me...	9
0	Community Emergency Response Training?	9
0	Woah! Don't go overboard!!   Just kidding! Paint those toes! :D	9
0	That's because the 'Golden age of SRS' ended a few years ago. Back then, snowflakes really did use things like trigger warnings and 'shitlord' unironically and all over the place. Now it's mocked so hard that only the craziest of the puritans still use the terms seriously.	9
0	The question is, did you tell him you would?	9
0	What are you talking about? You wanted to know why people mock trigger warnings and SJW approved insults, and I pointed my finger at the culprit.	9
0	Awww that sucks; is there something else maybe? Like any medication you're taking or are you anxious/depressed/stressed?	9
0	Never posted there honey; you should stick to the Tia/FPH/SRSsucks nexus of reactionary circlejerks. You're clearly not capable of operating outside of it without throwing people under the bus for having traumatic experiences you laugh at but will never face.	9
0	Right, but doesn't tss go away basically right after you remove the tampon?	9
0	&gt; Greece is a bunch of islands in the Mediterranean sea.  &gt; Holy shit, how are people upvoting this. Is that you America? Knock it off, you are shit at geography	9
0	Ahhh ok; yeah, arousal can be.more difficult in older women, but, there are medicines that can help with that (especially bloodflow). You should ask your Doctor about it if yory haven't already. But still, props on the body working; that's great building up to sexy time or not!	9
0	That sounds like trp stuff	9
0	I can't?!  Damn, then it must be my imagination.  Going to need someone for some verification just to be sure... and science!  Edit: for all you downvoters: thank you for taking the time to do that!  If i would drink alcohol then by now had open up a bottle of wine, run myself a bath, lit someone candles and listen to the radio.   Ah well, Wineless it is.  "it's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice"                                         -scooter	9
0	You are overthinking it.	9
0	We are being nice to people we are attracted to because that's how we genuinely feel. There's no conscious malicious plan, human brains are just wired this way. And hoping for something in return doesn't make being nice fake or dishonest.	9
0	For the past three years around Christmas my abusive ex has messaged me on fb asking to catch up. I'm too much of a ninny so I politely declined both times, but I'm seriously considering responding with "No, you piece of shit. I would rather drown in sewage than see you again."	9
0	I could see where she is coming from. I've heard that in the sciences there can actually be a high degree of sexual discrimination and sort of a "boys club" mentality. I'm not sure to what degree that is true, but it could certainly burn someone out to have to deal with that. I wouldn't buy it if she was saying women can't have a passion for science or the intellect for it, because that is a load of rubbish.	9
0	&gt; Greece is a bunch of islands in the Mediterranean sea.	9
0	Omg that is horrible! Stupid Artists &gt;:( You may be able to find a struggling artist on some place like deviant art that may be cheaper? They'd be more excited about doing something i'm sure.	9
0	I dunno.  Covers aren't cheap.  I paid like over $150 to this dude.  Gone. :(  Figure a new edition should have a new cover amirite?	9
0	Yeah a traditional artist it may be over $150 but often times some artists on Deviant art will take a lower commission if they are personally new to doing commissions. It's worth a look. Don't lose hope though! You can always go for a more simplistic look or something for this one and that'd be easier on your wallet i'd think. If you're into that?	9
0	I had a basic cover for the first time I self published.  It didn't grab anyone's attention and my book didn't sell. :/  I have a buddy who's able to photoshop but his computer is in the process of melting down.	9
0	Also [this](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/188k68yzol1z8gif/original.gif) and [this.](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs1/3013583_o.gif)  edit: meant to say "someone I *thought* was cool"	9
0	I like how he complains that people take information and put the biggest spin possible right before he said that the "feminist machine" was vilifying "all men who don't follow that perceived narrative".  What it sounds like actually happened is some bloggers got lazy.  They also confused one batch of douchebags for a slightly different batch of douchebags.	9
0	I read this and thought, how can you ever forget?! Surely you can feel it in your vagina?	9
0	I had no idea. Too many random strangers over the years tell me I need to dye it. I always assume it's out of fashion.	9
0	That's so wonderful! Congratulations! I wish you all the best and an easy transition!	9
0	Sorry about that, your names all look the same ^^;  Also no offense, but I just copy pasted that because I got tired of people not doing their research and just believing what people say on one site ^^;	9
0	Haha, that's a new level of geekery.  I salute you.	9
0	And I'm one of those people who is **disproportionately** bothered by those on Reddit, who don't actually know either way, but must come shit on things by claiming them false, because gut feelings?  The desire to shit on things?  Kind of like how this woman shit on this little girl in Disneyland. This sub is my Disneyland. Why do you have to shit on it?	9
0	&gt; I don't really give a shit	9
0	Facebook games are terrible for this. They make games that are essentially social marketing.	9
0	Well I'm posting so many comments because I did the exact same thing :C I had my suspisions, but I also immediately jumped to conclusions. That is why I'm trying to tell as many people as possible that it's all fake and propaganda. MRA's are unfairly being labaled as extremists, and by people who "claim" to be for "equality" (many modern day feminists). Which honestly pisses me off :C	9
0	Sorry, I wasn't clear. TrollX is great comfort to behold for the same reason the post's joke is funny. There's just ubiquitous stuff intrinsic to guy culture that is almost impossible to escape.  (Even on TrollY sometimes, to be honest.)  Sometimes I just want to hang out and hear what the other half of the human species up to.	9
0	I was like 17 so it was super embarrassing. Not to mention I left my top in there, and the guy who gave it back was the lifeguard I had a teenager crush on. I wanted to sink into the floor and die 18 times over.	9

0	I teach my kids not to put up with anyone's ridiculous bullshit. As they grow older, and more eloquent, this involves teaching appropriate responses to rude and unwanted actions, yes. And "Suck my ass!" is an entirely appropriate response to a complete stranger who felt entitled to comment upon your clothing, choices and gender bias in four nasty words!	9
0	If you did one second of research, you would see that Return of Kings (the site that posted this garbage) is vehemently against the MRA movement.	9
0	Oh I agree, its totally immature as fuck. Thats what makes it awesome.	9
0	Not mine.  My son's busy believing he's a tiger. *rawr!*	9
0	well, i think keto is restrictive while being lenient within the confines of the diet. you absolutely cannot eat a great number of things (carbs, sugar) but everything else is fair game. for me, the difficult thing was ascertaining precisely what i could and could not eat, which was really just a matter of looking up nutritional facts online and downloading myfitnesspal.	9
0	Holy. Shit. I have *never* heard of this in my life, and I'm not really sure how, since I pick at my skin and bite my nails as well. I always thought it was just a bad habit and it's never been enough to be very noticeable, except the nails. I always thought the nail biting was because my mom took away my pacifier when I was less than a year old (oral fixation type thing) and I never guessed the picking and pulling was related.  Wow. Thank you.	9
0	This comic is about equalism, not egalitarianism. Thanks for playing.	9
0	I was going to respond to your points, but you're already being a total asshole about it so instead: Fuck off.	9
0	Um, any trick to finding more women like you out there? I asking for my friend. No really, I have a GF in real space.	9
0	Huge trigger for me. There should of been a warning. I lost mine in a very similar situation but with no one watching.   A lot of people are not happy with where the show is going.	9
0	Time to go grinding. If it wasn't for that nasty insecurity trait...	9
0	I agree. I can't help it though! A) Everything looks delicious. B) Most of the food looks like stuff that I would never think about... [EXAMPLE](http://hipfoodiemom.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Apple-Walnut-Tart-with-Maple-Custard-Baking-A-Moment.jpg). IT'S SO PRETTY. I CAN'T.	9
0	What about guys who are nice just to be nice and have no expectations whatsoever?   I think that's called being a human...  Edit: Sorry I didn't follow the circlejerk ladies. Some of us actually act like decent human beings.   Edit 2: YES MORE DOWNVOTES.   Edit 3: You know if something is really downvoted, people are more likely to open it. Curiosity gets the best of people.	9
1	That's not really the point of the piece, I think. It's more about the aggressors than the masked woman. Their escalating, aggressive behavior, and how little it took to provoke it, is shocking.  And the artists went out there that night hoping to get something meaningful on film. In that context I think the idea that "she put herself in a terrible situation" is kinda nonsensical. The situation being edgy was the entire premise.	10
1	**I'm a person just like you, with hopes and ambitions.**   Ch'yar ul'nyar shaggornyth, vugtlagln vulgtmm.  **I don't deserve hate just because I'm trans!**   Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!	10
1	all trans people are merely vessels for our lord cthulu	10
1	&gt; Hey, everything aligned. Phew. Guess I won't have to buy him boobs for his high school graduation present.  Randomly in this otherwise nice and supportive article, the myth that all trans women's breasts are implants gets perpetuated.	10
1	I love how poverty was just a bullet point and not a focus.   Racial issues are totally what's hot right now.  Non-white, especially black transwomen are very much visible as topics of discussion.  Transwomen and especially transmen who are in poverty are nearly invisible. I find it sad how this article doesnt even mention transmen at all.	10
1	What is with haters and their obsession with dogs? "Mentally a woman? What about mentally a dog, isn't that crazy?" "You want to let men marry men? Next thing you know, they'll let men marry dogs!" "You're having consensual sex with three different people? Why not throw a dog in there, too, ya freak!"  I just don't get it.	10
1	So GAS? Uhm...uhm...uhmmmmmmmm. I dunno if in the future I wanna get GAS.	10
1	Who had 2015 as the year cracked would become trans positive? I had  2065. TYBJ	10
1	That Cracked article was... good? Informative?  Where am I??	10
1	&gt; A person who calls herself a woman is a she, a person who calls himself a man is a he, a person who checks private parts for verification of gender is called a sex offender.  This is a great line!	10
1	It was still pretty cringey. Using a trans awareness piece to mention how religious people are the nicest people ever is pretty gross, considering how many transgender people have been turned away by religioun-affiliated homeless and women's shelters.	10
1	Jenner didn't really say what pronouns to use. All anyone said about pronouns was that Jenner asked them to use male pronouns during the interview since it would be the last interview done "as a man." So it's a little confusing what pronouns should be used now that the interview is over. Plus a lot of people were commenting or whatever anytime someone said "she" or "they" that it is disrespectful to change pronouns before a person asks.   I really wish Jenner had specified.	10
1	Here's the thing, that's how the public viewed trans women back then. As mentally unstable men. It's just offensive and insulting. The trans phobic part is when everyone found out that she wasn't a Cis Woman. The crying game scene, everyone's reaction to finding out. The sleeping around with everyone. Ya it's transphobic.   addtion, to be fair the movie is old enough to drink. No wonder I didn't come out then.	10
1	Please don't post Daily Mail links.	10
1	Don't post daily mail links! They have systematically attacked and outed Trans people over the years, they are not our friends and we should not support them by helping to increase their advertising revenue.	10
1	They're essentially the internet tabloids.	10
1	I really wish people would stop with the "born a man" garbage. It's like  * nobody's born a man, they're generally born a baby * from what we've figured out about the neuroscience of being trans it doesn't even seem to necessarily be true?? * also it's been used to attack and demean trans women since, like, forever  It really isn't cool and needs to stop.	10
1	Dead name.   Born a man.   Biologically male.   Surgery as the milestone for completion of transition.   If we play the Trans article drinking game with this one we'll all be dead from alcohol poisoning.	10
1	I have only one response to this.  Wat?	10
1	SO, this is purely conjecture on my part, but I believe I understand what is happening here.  He appears to be a very specific kind of crazy. He is the kind of crazy that sees being transgender as a matter of identity and supports it, while seeing homosexuality as some sort of intentional behavior that should be criticized. I don't think we should be waving victory flags over this guy.  If I'm wrong, and he's pulled a complete 180 on all LGBT issues, please correct me on this.	10
1	no, I'm sure you're right. I do however wonder which sex Santorum doesn't want Jenner to marry now though.	10
1	"Rick santorum have a snickers"  "Why?"  "Because you forget to be a raging dick waffle when you're hungry."	10
1	"Thanks."  "Better?"  "Better. Now let me tell you how gay marriage is undermining American values."	10
1	Good on Santorum for his statement on this point.  No way would I ever vote for him, considering his stance on most LGBT issues and wars against them "evil" foreigners and for "us" bankers and other multinational corporations who "need" total deregulation.  Nobody is totally 100% wrong and evil, and Santorum has sort of shown us this, finally, to our welcome surprise.  May Santorum continue to progress, without our votes but with our full encouragement that he change as a person.	10
1	Also, from a purely cynical view, Jenner is also a rich Republican. So not denouncing her could be a financial decision. But, honestly, I'm not sure if that makes a difference.	10
1	And which sex wouldn't Santorum wish Jenner to DIVORCE???	10
1	I don't think this is pandering. It'd make no political sense for someone whose entire base are religious righters to support a trans person.	10
1	Money can't buy love, but it can buy Republicans' support…	10
1	Pretty sure the santorum definition was [Dan Savage's work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_for_%22santorum%22_neologism).	10
1	I've had a guy 'compliment' me that I "wasn't going to be some sissy and instead adapted my body to fit my role". This guy supported insurance coverage for all medical aspects of transition yet was against marriage equality. I don't think you can just divide people in pro-lgbt and anti-lgbt, the world (and the people in it) just isn't that simple.	10
1	Jenner specifically stated that he wanted to keep male pronouns for now. Calm down.	10
1	&gt;adapted my body to fit my role.  Ah, the 'muslim paradigmn'...*transition away the gay*...lols	10
1	Who goes to the bathroom in a sink?! I know this is satire, but is this really a thing?	10
1	I think the point is that these are things that happen (peeing in a sink, peeing on a house/lawn), but no one is spearhead-ing a movement to stop them. People are more upset at about a trans* person in the washroom, then they are about another ciswoman peeing in the sink.	10
1	lol i think the point is more that they would have to be peeing in a sink for anyone else in the bathroom to actually be able to watch them....not that anybody actually does that...it's really not a thing that happens	10
1	BTW Jazz Jennings loves mermaids.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Jennings#Personal_life	10
1	At the big scale, I hope this won't imply worse treatment for trans prisoners in general.  At the individual scale, I can't feel pity for Michelle Kosilek.  I believe she's anguished.  Okay.  She's a murderer.  Her various attempts to escape punishment bespeak unrepentance.  A person can be trans and still be really, really horrible.	10
1	Great. And since most prisons these days are for-profit the chance of any prisoner receiving the bare fucking minimum level of adequate care just went out the window.	10
1	And they're still exclusive to females, now it's just all females!	10
1	Then you don't believe everyone has a right to necessary health care.	10
1	&gt;We investigated differences in corpus callosum shape at the midsagittal plane using MRI for different subjects: **normal** males, **normal** females, and subjects with gender identity disorder (GID)  Ugh.  But thank you for the warning. We need more of those warnings for PubMed.	10
1	The wording "normal males, normal females, and subjects with gender identity disorder (GID)" is rather :S. How about males and females with and without GID...  Edit: Never noticed it's from 2005, that explains it, but doesn't make it better.	10
1	Frankly, I'm just glad they didn't try saying shit like "transsexual men" to mean trans women.	10
1	This study's pretty old, as trans stuff goes - it's from 2005. Cut em some slack on linguistic quibbles, it's good data.	10
1	'stuff like this' Offers proof that it isn't just psychological. And if you look into 'stuff like this' you'll find that gender differences in neurology seem to be all about statistics, hence it being used as a sole diagnostic tool being very unlikely, while it does support our (transsexuals) claims of not being our assigned sex.	10
1	I don't know how I feel about this. On one hand, this is awesome and I love that this is gaining traction.  On the other hand, could our opposition use this as a civil union of sorts and tell us "you have Mx, that should be good enough that I don't have to call you you preferred pronouns"?  Just my thoughts on this.	10
1	Some people use different pronouns, like zie, or xie, or sie, or e, or they, etc. These people are just as trans as the rest of us, but for one reason or another don't want to use he/she.  I think you're doing a lot of otherifying yourself, by putting yourself against non-binary people. We're all fighting for the same team.	10
1	Wait, so because the majority of people identify as male or female, it isn't worth the effort to affirm the genders of those who don't?	10
1	And as long as it's an option, (and not something that's assigned to all trans people) nobody has anything to complain about.   Except maybe having to learn how to pronounce it, but that's just laziness.	10
1	Equivocation is not the same as using a term that is a superset of two other sets.   A gender-neutral term is in no way affirming of the gender or lived experience of a man or woman, whether that person's gender is the opposite of what was assigned at birth or not.  "Trans" in that headline did not just *include* genderqueers; it *meant* "genderqueer".  It's the same as forms and drop-down lists that give "male", "female" and "trans" as the three gender options.	10
1	A ... *Christian shoe* promoter?  What exactly makes a shoe a *Christian shoe*?	10
1	Thanks for shitting on the first honorific I've ever felt any affinity for.  Will certain bigots use this to try to side step the right and proper way to address binary trans people? Almost certainly, but that is because they are bigots and for no other reason. They will find ways of othering trans people regardless, so it would be nice if you would aim your hostility where it's warranted and not at another group of marginalized individuals.	10
1	It is really disheartening, as someone who's only recently realising their place in the trans community to wander into a comment section where a bunch of binary trans folks are loudly and vehemently complaining about how a smaller, more marginalized group within their numbers is getting a little boost because it *might* be used against them by bigots. You realise this is exactly the same as the LGB community throwing trans people under the bus because of how they reflect on them in the eyes of bigots.  You are attacking trans people because of what bigots might think and do.  Thanks so much.	10
1	1. I think Mx. is optional  2. This is a victory for non-binary people :) A little positivity would be nice!  3. I'm really sorry if you misgendered or even misunderstood by any of this, but honestly everyone here knows it's not a blanket term and hopefully the people writing the dictionary will know that too.	10
1	Christ, calm down. No-one is shitting on you. This is literally a new tool for a subset of our community to use. Just because a magazine misused it doesn't mean you're suffering from erasure. Are people calling for Bruce Jenner to be a Mx?	10
1	I read through his Twitter the other day. He claims he did it as a social experiment to see how people would react to something they deem as offensive. It sounds like a poor excuse to save face. The guy screwed his chance at being a game developer for the rest of his potential career. It isn't often that a game is too offensive to be published on Steam.	10
1	The soles have been saved.	10
1	This is why you don't operate on the "squeaky wheel" theory when you work in HR.  TL;DR - A store manager went rogue, mistreating the plaintiff during her transition, when she finally went to HR they stated the manager was not following policy but wanted to refer to their supervisor for assistance in fixing the situation, but never followed up and the store manager continued to be an ass.	10
1	So happy to see her case is finally moving forward. Victoria is a wonderful person and did not deserve this sort of treatment whatsoever.	10
1	This is exactly what I assumed happened as soon as I read the article.  Now we have to see how B&amp;N handles this mistake.  I hope they do the proper thing I'd hate to have to stop going to B&amp;N.	10
1	"won't someone think of the children."  such eye rolls.	10
1	&gt;Cameron Langrell was a teenage boy who felt trapped in the wrong body.  Every damn time. Even in death, you can't avoid being misgendered by the media.  I wish the best for Cameron's parents. They sound nice.	10
1	Fuck man these stories are always hard to read. I hate it when they misgender a person too. I want to slap the writer.   Kids are cruel. If I ever came out in high school I'd have faced a lot of bullshit. I can't imagine what they must go through. That takes a level of bravery that I never had and in some cases I still lack.	10
1	Standing to pee is something I'm gonna miss if I ever decide to get surgery.  (See flair xD)	10
1	What are the 10 things? I don't have headphones on me right now.	10
1	The last night in my hometown before I left for surgery my friends had a party at their place.  One of the last things I did before going to bed was to walk out in their back yard (no one else was around),  I stood in the middle of the yard and pee'd standing up for the last time.	10
1	God I hate number three so much, it happens to me all the time.	10
1	number 6, because porta-potties are fucking nasty.	10
1	Seriously dude you are in the wrong sub. Please take your hate speech elsewhere.	10
1	&gt; How is it hate? its the truth, and sometimes the truth hurts.  Science disagrees with you. But hey, don't let facts get in the way of your self-righteousness.	10
1	It's ignorance of the highest order.  If you think any of us are in denial about our chromosomes or our bodies, you're the one who is acutely delusional.  We are reminded of them constantly either by the mirror or by assholes on the internet.  This is our daily challenge.  And no we don't harm ourselves because we're delusional.  We harm ourselves because we are hounded, harassed, abused, discriminated against, and woefully misunderstood by chronic fucktards.. yes I'm talking to you.  Depart now, or stay and read but shut the fuck up you disrespectful twat.	10
0	Point being she could have avoided a lot of what happened? I'm not sure how else to explain it.	10
0	&gt;  for every TPOC who is attacked there's another white trans person who is denied a job, housing, or is also attacked because of their gender identity.    Good thing TPOC don't apply for jobs, right?    edit:  &gt; Typically by other blacks.  What a vile and smug little sentence to slide in there. As if black transgender victims of violence are less deserving of the community sympathy because "tsk tsk, the blacks are doing it to themselves."	10

0	&gt; the fact that you're blaming white transpeople for this specific issue   Excuse me? Where am I doing this?	10
0	There are not many older trans persons in general because of the lack of resources until very very recently, I only have experience with young transpersons, Perhaps I should have left the age variable out or used it for both groups.   I could find citations if you'd like, but you can google "trans person assaulted or trans person killed" as easily as I can. in the majority of cases i've seen, its been by a black male, again i'm happy to google if you're not willing or able.	10
0	I don't feel like the existence of privilege (white, male, or otherwise) is inflammatory. And if it is, it really shouldn't be.   &gt; What I'm seeing here isn't a show of solidarity with fellow transwomen and transmen, it's promoting race-biased ideological infighting.   I agree with you here.	10
0	And in case you missed me asking the first time ask   &gt; You're shouting about wanting division from the white community     Where did I say anything to this effect? Are you confusing me with someone else?	10
0	The girl in that story is cute as, lucky guy. I personally wouldn't think anyone really needs to be told, but if it's important to them, all the best to them	10
0	sure, but saying that gender is concrete and immutable by 5 years old is demonstrably untrue.	10
0	I'm in the same position and it's still fucking with my head	10
0	20% of transgender people voted for the GOP? LOL.. I absolutely needed a good laugh tonight, thank you.	10
0	I stopped watching it about 30 seconds into the video. The reason is that they clearly do not understand the difference between gender and sex. Gender is defined by what's between your ears, whereas, sex is defined by what's between your legs.   They aren't altering their gender, they are altering their looks and in some cases sexual organs to match gender.	10
0	&gt;he's a woman  &gt;HE'S a woman  &gt;he's A woman  &gt;he's a WOMAN  &gt;he's a woman	10
0	Oklahoma is typical of GOP-controlled states:   It's heathcare offers NOTHING to the transgender population toward transition -- zero support.  For 10 years it paid for an aggressive campaign to uphold the state's ban on gay marriage.    LGBT employment discrimination is not protected here either.  So tell me why I'd ever vote Republican again?	10
0	rick santorum stance on lgnt - a simple search yields his hatred of the LGBT community	10
0	This is crazy, I live right near Smith and they have always been exclusive to females. I know quite a few lesbians from that school haha.	10
0	I used to work in the jail system and we always separated trans people or people with varying genitals and other physical changes that would denote sex. There was never an issue and we had plenty of hermaphrodites and trans people stay in all male GP without incident.	10
0	I suppose, it's interesting considering different levels of transition and what Smith has been for years, like would they accept someone who is all male but on HMT? Just interested in how it will work.	10
0	In [this Episode of the podcast Young Talk](https://soundcloud.com/youngtalkpodcast/young-talk-episode-02), [Annie Mok](http://heyanniemok.tumblr.com/) riffs on the idea that Hans Christian Andersen might have been a trans woman. Might just be some headcanon but its interesting to think about nonetheless. Here's [part 1](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/hazlitt/comix/swim-thru-fire-pt-1) of a comic authored by Mok about Mermaids.	10
0	74% accuracy? sorry that's only slightly better than tossing a coin!  So lets say 0.5% of population is trans, the remaining 99.5% is cis. Will round up the test's accuracy to 75% cos it won't matter.   If this test says someone is trans there's a 24.5% chance that it's a cis person, and a 0.375% chance that it's a trans person that's correctly gendered. I think you can see the problem with the test.	10
0	Kinda. I think the lack of nonbinary or agender identification and the assumption that gender can't be fluid sort of poisons it.	10
0	So what does it mean for the 25% who fail the gender test? Are they fakers?  Go look up positive predictive value on Wikipedia. It's interesting I guess, but about as useful as finger lengths.	10
0	under the constitution they're not. You don't have a right to a service.	10
0	You're right about the speedy trial. But the constitution is right, you can't change it, it's what the country was founded upon. You do not have a right to a sex change, it's a service you pay for. I mean I guess it's different if you're in jail (because you can't make money) but outside of jail you must and should pay for it.	10
0	While this works great for genderqueer, third gender and such, it's pretty much irrelevant to the trans population, most of whom would prefer the honorific of their preferred gender.	10
0	I struggle to believe this'll go anywhere further than Ze, Xe, Zer, and any other words.  Also, I do not want a fucking Mx. before my name; this isn't going to be a fucking blanket term for the whole transgender community. Stop touting it as though it's for all trans folks.	10
0	There are several clear issues with that definition, the short definition basically excludes binary people, and the 'full definition' groups transsexuals with transvestites (ugh) and say they both have a gender identity that doesn't match the [assigned] sex at birth. which is just wrong for transvestites (which is a word I'm pretty sure isn't used that much anymore).	10
0	WOW! Despite the overwhelming majority of transgender people identifying fully as male or female, the marriam-webster definition is synonymous with gender queer and doesn't even INCLUDE old-boring-binary-trans! This does not reaffirm my point at all!	10
0	I don't see it as self determination. I have a medical problem and I'm getting it handled, I would have loved, for many years, if I could get rid of it an easier, more socially accepted way. I'm not fighting for self determination anymore than anyone else who gets a birth defect surgically fixed. I'm all for it, but it's not really my problem. People seeing it as my problem is a problem to me though.	10
0	Genderqueer excludes people who identify with a third gender which is actually pretty common in different cultures. Non-binary includes everyone outside of the gender binary of man or woman.	10
0	&gt;We harm ourselves because we are hounded, harassed, abused, discriminated agains  Maybe theres a reason for that? Embracing mental illness is very harmful behavior. Just as people tend to avoid addicts, psychotics, the mentally retarded, etc... it is a natural tendency to be turned away from and even hostile to people that are not the norm. it is instinct to be offended by people with gender dysmorphia.	10

0	Genderqueer implies that those people fall out of the bounds of a gender. For people within a third gender, this is exclusionary. Non-binary includes everyone outside of the gender binary. I'm not sure if I can be clearer.	10
0	I dunno, whenever I go pop into those comments I just laugh my ass off. Maybe it's just me.	10
0	Yes. As long as we have "gender", we are under an arbitrary, artificial set of restrictions. Some people never run into those restrictions (bars) for a wide number or reasons. That doesn't mean they aren't there, you just don't "see" them.  They are happy living in a small little box, or they willfully ignore that there is a lock on the door and never try to open it, or they beat down one door and never notice the one farther out.	10
0	Of course it's not how most people view gender. MOST people don't accept transgender either. And it's better described as an Agender experience. Calling me an ideologue though is an ad hominem argument and doesn't invalidate my point. Besides I don't see anything wrong with "zealously advocating an ideology" that I believe in. I'm not a troll, I'm open to changing my mind but just saying "That's not how their gender is to most people" doesn't hold water with me (or probably MOST of the people on this board).	10
0	Gender neutral uniforms already exist. They're called trousers!	10
0	I am opposed to both boarding schools and school uniforms, but I think this is still a positive development. It removes *one* of the reasons why I am opposed to school uniforms.	10
0	Has the second one *ever* happened to you in real life? This is like a straw-situation. The only people who butt into conversations like this in real life are jerks anyway.	10
0	You must remember that as a filmmaker he's not expressing his personal views and opinions, he's making a commentary on what's currently out there now. Don't hate the guy because what he's observing is ludicrous.	10
0	except the point of the joke is that his porn addiction has gone too far. someone could insert anything in there, maybe say, 'jewish grandmothers' and the joke's premise wouldn't be that jewish grandmothers are disgusting, but that the lead should... not be into so much porn.   chicks with dicks and guys with tits is just an easier punchline. is it lazy? yes. is it offensive? yeah, kinda, but i'm not really bothered.   and it's not like people have a right to not be offended anyway.	10
0	In hind sight were probably better off. A group of girls can be evil little monsters.	10
0	Anything helps, feel free! I'm at the limits of what I can do to help as well.	10
0	Agreed, it won't stop them. But with only 3% of rapists spending a day in jail according to RAINN, I'd be happier to have an extra chance at snagging an asshole off the streets.    Edit: I may just be still pissed that my attacker also received no judgement, AND went on to reassault.	10
0	I get that. I just want the conversation to be had instead of ignored.	10
0	Yeah, so... I understand that. Trust me. I'm trans too. That argument really doesn't... There *is* additional risk. But you're right, short of carding people in front of the bathroom, it's not happening.	10
0	It would certainly help. There would be an air of certification behind the marker. Of course, there are places that don't allow trans folks to change their documentation properly, but they'd have to change to make that easier for these bathroom bills to work right.	10
0	Excluding trans people from bathrooms may be "working as designed", but it's clearly not working. Why would they want to change it? Because it isn't working.   And yeah, with the marker and with enforcement, I think it would be fine. People would then have to realize that we're just people, and it's not a scary thing. I think there's got to be a better way to do this though.  I just don't have a solution that can't be weaponized against trans people.	10
0	some visual artists are just bettr off sticking to what they r good at...	10
0	&gt;They don't care about getting a reaction  O.K.	10
0	It's like being a womanizer.  Their dicks still get rock hard at the sight of an attractive naked woman.  But their short sighted primitive brains can't understand that upsetting the source makes them loose fap material.	10
0	I'd be willing to do so, if they can order me 10 gram Chinese Nembutal?	10
0	Meh, its regular trolling.  Nothing too targeting, just annoying.  I wish   I had a Chrome Extension to block all of these shitposts.	10
0	Fair enough, I more or less chalked the thread that this was part of with the same idea, general trolling, but the extent this poster went to to specifically target trans people's experience just rubbed me harder the wrong way.	10
0	Actually he said he wants to be a comma, like the literary thing, and used the trans experience as a joke for it...	10
0	Didn't figure there was much thought, I didn't think it was wildly malicious, but this kind of stuff happens all the time, and leads people to thinking it is okay, so i typically say something. This time I was just unsure what to say.	10
0	given the conversation that lead to it, and the proximity to the often-used invalidation toward transfolk, I feel that was it's intent there. To be fair, I haven't seen that copy pasta before.	10
0	That's how I see it too. Passing means trying to appear cis. In that sense, it  is a  sort  of  deception,  but  it is also something many of  us have to do in order to stay alive.	10
0	With how intertwined being read correctly AND passing as cis is currently, I don't think it's deception at all. The conditions are flawed. We make do with the conditions as best we can.	10
0	Yeah, true enough.	10
0	The catholic church (and any others) do not deserve praise just because one person from their order isn't trying to orstracize trans people while still condeming them to hell. A trans person who calls themselves catholic is either masochist or delusional.	10
0	No, such changes only affect trans people who are LGB.  So, this is not an "LGBT" victory.	10
0	while some people *try* to pass, some people pass without trying.   passing has nothing to do with intent, it's how your expression is read/interpreted by others.	10
0	no, *pass as* means being viewed/regarded by some other person(s) as a member of a group.   that acceptance, view, and/or perception exists independently of whatever intent/motive (if any) the "passing person" had. that has nothing to do with deception since many people can "pass as" something without even trying.	10
0	It's really troubling to hear such a big name misuse words like 'bravery' when they really mean 'courage'.  If you're not familiar, I suggest reading [this article](http://www.differencebetween.net/language/difference-between-courage-and-bravery/)	10
0	I got one word for this girl: medicaid. As poor as she seems to be, it'd mean free mones for as long as she needs the economic help.	10
0	really tired of seeing white trans folk write about how they could be killed at any minute for being trans when that's not really what the data shows.	10
0	ya, and ur trottin out every usage of that word *but* the one that applies to how *we* use it.  whatev, i'm done with this. Feel free to have the last word if u want it, 'k. :)	10
0	I'm sorry if this offends, but I can't see how anyone can be LGBT and religious.  Like, if God exists, (s)he's got some explaining to do. We don't even need start with LGBT issues. We can even start small.	10
0	Therapy is needed badly, its a mental illness and they need real medical help. You cannot be two genders. Anyone that says otherwise has a screw loose in their head.	10

1	I live in St. Louis and we see people like this every year protesting PrideFest. Churches will hand out water bottles to parade participants with notes attached that are like the signs the people in the video are holding. Or they will smile at you and give you a pamphlet filled with hate. Its disconcerting because they seem like nice people but their message is so hateful.	13
1	He said as he drew the katana from its sheath. He took his stance and calmly inhaled. Judas lightly tossed the coinpurse up and caught it before scoffing. The guards encircled Jesus and drew their weapons. Judas bowed with a flourish before he turned to walk away.  "Kill him" He ordered as he made his way down the path.  The first guard lunged, and was quickly dispatched by a swift swipe of the katana. The other guards grew furious, and entered the fray. Soon it was clear to Jesus that this was it. This was his moment of glory. The moment he would be remembered for.	13

1	&gt; racial vilification &gt; you are effectively slandering a race  Islam is not a race. Islam is a religion. Criticizing a belief system, slandering it, fighting against the effect it has on people or societies, is not the same as doing the same to a person or people based on immutable qualities like race.  We need to stop conflating ideological criticism with racism.	13
1	There's a difference also, between criticizing a racial culture, and actually spreading hatred, slander, or lies about a race just based on  their common physical features. One is racism, the other is just acknowledging there's a cultural problem that seems to be consistent.  There's also a difference between inciting riots or lynching, and simply spreading stereotypes.	13
1	She's correct, but there is absolutely no way she'd be this pissed off if Christian extremists shot and killed someone making fun of Christianity.

I also find the future a little more hopeful when I think that maybe religion is losing it's "sacred" place in society.	13
1	You can't just lie to people like you used to.	13
1	I've been thinking about this for a while now as well.  How does capitalism continue to work when technology is so good that you end up with far more people than things that need doing or are even done well by people?  Even a basic income guarantee, the best idea I've heard to address this problem, seems like a limited solution.	13
1	Do you really think a regular truck driver could stop a crime syndicate...? The truck would have the ability to call the police if the doors opened for whatever reason, I'm sure the locks would be better too, they could pick better routes to have the truck to drive through, and honestly truck drivers cost more to insure and pay, so I still think it would be worth going with automation.	13
1	Maybe capitalism as an economic model dies as something better takes its place. The first step is a post labor scarcity society, which we are approaching, then a post resource scarcity society, then finally a post-currency society.	13
1	The article failed to mention the greatest benefit to self-driving trucks: no more semi truck games of highway leapfrog. No more "I'm going 66mph and the truck ahead of me is going only 65, I'm going to tie up traffic for 15 minutes as I creep past."	13
1	What makes you think a driver would try to stop bandits attempting to hijack them? I bet corporations have policies stating that the driver should do absolutely nothing to be a hero in such circumstances.	13
1	We're better off fixing the problem of conservative bias in Economics.	13
1	So let me make sure I understand you here. Conservative and liberal bias are both just as bad as each other, except liberals are worse?	13
1	I'd wager it's because it's very hard to remain a conservative once you know what social psychologists know.  Not without an enormous cognitive dissonance.    If that's "Bias" then we've just decided to call 'changing your mind in light of facts' a bias, which is silly.	13
1	You forgot gumption, moxie and stick-to-it-iveness  &gt;Do you think conservatives are against food security, parental education level, school quality, or the ability of parents to provide enriching activities outside of school?  Yes, in that they think the gov't has no role to play in providing these services.	13

1	[A dremmel makes short work of the phrase on coins as well.](http://i.imgur.com/hW9Dg.jpg)	13
1	I feel like this is more a symptom than the actual problem, and (as much as I agree that having the phrase on our money is bullshit) arguing the point now is just baiting the fundies into making more irritating Facebook posts. The good news is that the underlying problem (religion) is definitely on the decline. Hopefully it won't be long before this change could be made without exciting enough of the population to be newsworthy.	13
1	This just seems so utterly unimportant to me. At this point it's just a relic of an earlier time and removing it isn't going to make anyone's life any better.	13
1	Note how much effort goes into *preventing* any free thought.	13
1	What is it with Christianity and instruments of death? Their savior is displayed on an execution device and the execution device is the symbol of the faith. May as well have a religion of the noose or the guillotine.  And now, the name of this movement is a reference to a quote that equates a full quiver to a full nursery. May as well be a gun magazine. "Yep I've got plenty of bullets ready to shoot and kill people" = I have a lot of children because I cum a lot in the right place.	13
1	These people define backward.	13
1	[This](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/nolongerquivering/) is a very good blog about the Quiverfull movement, from someone who was raised in it and eventually left.	13
1	That's the point I think. They're supposed to be "God warriors" and by having so many spawn they ensure that their 'army of the faith' is strong in numbers... Hence the full quiver...    Faith (and spreading it) is very much a war to a lot of Christians like this.	13
1	&gt;The truth be told, our reasoning generally parallels that of the abortion culture   Abortion is a culture? Last I checked birth control prevented a lot of abortions.    To me this reads as "we are losing people in the church so we better start making more since we can't bring them in from the educated crowd."   Scary.	13

0	The sad part is there are definitive benefits to fasting.  It's just not very well researched so people are prescribing it improperly.  Like for kids.  Or people with diabetes.  Proper study would determine when fasting would be benificial.	13
0	Ah that's ok, we don't have anything like that in Australia ... it must be in California or some hippy shit place like that ... *clicks link*  WHAT THE FUCK AUSTRALIA WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK	13
0	So why do Muslims do it?  Why is fasting a big part of religious enlightenment across multiple cultures?  If we can turn chewing bark into a medicine (aspirin) then we can learn some of the techniques that have helped people in the past and why.  Like fasting.  Of course, you can't patent fasting.  So there's little funding for that kind of research.  Without research people will continue to prescribe it based on anecdotes rather than data.	13
0	Fasting helps regulate hunger, helps regulate insulin (which may be why these people thought it would work, but fasting can't work miracles), and improves brain function.  The body gets kicked into serious mode as the survival instincts fire up.  It's difficult to deny that there are benefits to fasting, but research needs to be done to better quantify these benefits and how they can be used as part of a treatment plan.    Some info to start: http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-16/lifestyle/sns-201301151500--tms--premhnstr--k-i20130116-20130116_1_mark-mattson-calorie-restriction-calorie-intake	13
0	I bet you have taken medicine derived from willow bark.	13
0	There's some evidence to suggest that intermittent fasting is the best method.  While calorie restriction provides some benefits, skipping eating for a day (of course, so long as its tolerated) can trigger hormone changes, particularly switching the body to ketosis and provides a better control over the hunger signal which can be helpful to people with eating disorders.  This is why I'd like more research on the subject.	13
0	Specifically, there's 3 types of hunger signals the brain sends. There's, "Hey, the stomach is empty" and then about 12-24 hours later, "Hey, we need food."  Though not recommended, when you do hit about 2-3 weeks, that's when "We're starving" gets sent out.  Many people only experience the first and end up going from full stomach to full stomach and gaining weight.	13
0	isn't that where like timothy mcveigh came from?	13
0	&gt; offensive speech must be protected  Here in Australia we have rules against racial vilification in our Racial Discrimination Act. The government made a move to remove this law as increasingly right wing shock-jocks were being called up on it for making sweeping generalisations about people of a particular race.  I stand for freedom of speech, but this is an interesting case where you are effectively slandering a race. If you said something untrue about a person they can take you to court, but if you say it about a race of people, you are effectively protected.  I'm not sure where to draw a line on that one.  http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-04-30/george-brandis-ill-informed-on-right-to-be-bigots/5375302	13

0	First time ever i will agree with that dumb cunt Magyn Kelly	13
0	Nothing was 'absurd' about what she did. She takes issue with the inherent violence of apparently a lot of Muslims, and the mentality that a free nation should tread on eggshells around that religion so in order to not incite its adherents to murderous rage. She acted within the law, within her rights and within the cultural limits of America...    Kelly does deserve 'special credit' for her position in this case , because there are already so many (quite liberal and painfully well meaning) voices eagerly trying to generate as much buzz as they can about 'the limits of free speech'.	13

You guys crack me up pretending to value all human life above anything else and then someone does something you dont like and you think its morally ok to send someone to prison for using a treatment that the parents were dumb enough to allow. You dont fast if you're diabetic you will die, you eat sparingly and work shitty food out of your diet to rectify your metabolism.

0	That's optimistic.   Trucks carry different loads. Trucks have different engines of different states of repair. Either of these can dramatically affect acceleration ability, top speed, and fuel efficiency at a particular speed.  It is almost certain that multiple algorithms would be developed and shipping companies would have proprietary software.  This is the real world. Not a theoretical programing exercise.	13

0	Oh forfend that they would regale the audience with incidents that supported the proposition.  That the opponents to the proposition failed to reach even that level could be interpreted as exemplifying the relative strengths of the argument.     If you would prefer statistics to back the proposition, FIRE maintains a fairly extensive archive of instances of suppression of expression on campus and descriptions of the issues at hand.  I do not think it is out of bounds to suggest that there is a illiberal strain in the progressive left that would sell out classical Liberal values for the intellectual equivalent of a ham sandwich.  !	13
0	ever watch c-span?  our government starts sessions of congress and senate with prayers - do you really think this currency thing has any legs?  face it, we live in a christian country, just put up with it until enough of their grandchildren grow up atheist and can finally SEPARATE church and state maybe 300 years after our country's founding.  even currency scanners are christian - i've tried crossing out "in god we trust" with a sharpie, and a lot of machines you feed paper currency into won't recognize the bill anymore.	13
0	The fact that this is an issue is insane - stop caring about bullshit like this.	13
0	No, I really don't care.	13
0	No one is saying you have to believe in it, no one is saying you have to like any of the guys on the dollar bills or even the country the currency originates in. Most of us have better things to do with our time than ruminate over some archaic shit written on money.	13
0	This is the best answer here. Maybe after all the big problems are behind us we can focus on things like this (and no I'm not talking, 'there are starving kids in africa so who cares about problem x'), but right now this just seems so trivial it's not even worth talking about.	13

0	&gt; I'm expected to hand the cashier a piece of paper espousing trust in a deity That I don't believe in.  Why does that matter?	13
0	This is just a bunch of symbolic nonsense.  You have to pick your battles and some wording on a piece of paper or metal is not going to make much of a difference.  Everyone would be a lot better off focusing their energy on the *important* stuff, like maintaining separation of church and state.  And lots of other stuff.  I wish people would stop worrying about symbolic bullshit.  Even if the phrase was removed, what good would it do?  Seriously, what would happen?  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  But if you spend your time pushing back against proselytizing in schools, that actually is helpful.	13

0	I'm... not sure that anything in this is new.  It's just radical Christianity.  I don't know of any denomination that doesn't touch upon these ideas in various ways, whether greater or lesser.  So this is a fringe group based on the ideas that the larger mass was already espousing.  What's new or special about them?  And more importantly - what good are we doing by drawing attention to them as if they were worthy of any attention?	13

0	Why is this comment being down-voted?  Not a fan at all of your screen name but your comment is spot on.	13
0	I believe in the death penalty yes but I also believe the litmus test for guilt must be extremely high. If there is even the slightest shadow of a doubt then it should be taken off the table for that case. In case where guilt isn't a question and the argument is about what type of punishment is appropriate then the death penalty should be on the table so to speak.  The question of the victim's pain and suffering should not be forgotten when sentencing someone who is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, guilty; like the guy from the case I linked to above.	13
0	Yes, because the criminal who raped your sister in front of your parents and then killed them all deserves to live.   Its  logical and unemotional justification of capital punishment.	13
0	Happiness comes as a result of society. With a society that cares about you, problems people deal with in other countries becomes nonexistent, you have a safe existence with all you need, both in good and bad days, that makes people happy!	13
0	Some smart people claim Christian politics is influenced and controlled with mossad ideological subversion?$!.	13
1	&gt;But the ridiculous fever-pitch of it all is wearing thin: “I think a lot of kids also will kind of wake up at some point and say, ‘This feels a little suffocating, some of these ideas feel like it’s really being jammed down my throat,’ which is a good reason to kind of question it, right? Like, why is every week, you know, global-warming week?”	17
1	Serious question: Do you think the climate change policy implications proposed are better than the proposed implication of climate change?  I'm skeptical because anything we do to measurably affect temperatures (basically co2 emissions) will have drastic effects on the economy... FAR more than the 5% p.a. GDP loss that the alarmist Stern report claims will result from global warming.  It would also be incredible regressive and lead to far more damage to the third world then climate change ever could(from much higher energy prices).	17
1	You forgot noted researchers Clooney and Affleck.	17
1	&gt;The three main political parties have barely uttered a word about the environment and even the Green party seems to be prioritising an anti-austerity message  The Guardian, in the midsts of its massive climate campaign, must be utterly crushed to discover that they can't even get GREEN candidates to talk about climate change much.	17
1	What do you guys think about some of the reactions from the crowd? They strike me a bit fanatical, like at those churches, where you hear people scream in the background while the preacher talks: "Hallelujah!", "Thank you Jesus!", "Amen!", "Praise the Lord!" and so on. I mean, yeah, it's cool stuff, but calm down, it's not cold fusion or warp drive. Although the warp drive is looking pretty good this week, I think...	17
1	Quite unexpected... from the HuffPost, that is.	17
1	&gt;To suggest, as Naomi Klein does, that all 'we' need to do is stand up to 'them,' force evil corporations to leave lots of carbon in the ground, strike a few zeros off some faceless billionaires' bank accounts to cover the bill, and then happily carry on living the good life is trite and, ultimately, dishonest.  I like how even in the author's critique of Klein he can't come out and say it. Its not "dishonest", its completely fantastical and not even within the realm of possibility.	17

1	It's winding down to anti-capitalism.  I work in finance and when I ask the higher ups about the recent anti-capitalist movement, they tell me this example:  &gt;Take all the wealth in the US and make a pool of it.  Distribute that pool so that every working adult gets an equal amount of it (liberal wet dream).  Wait 10 years and check back on the population.  You'll have millionaires and poor people even though everyone started out with the same amount (conservative reality).	17
1	&gt;The fact that the colossal construction of wind turbines and solar installations also causes dramatic landscape blight is the sad irony of this green story. A journey through Gabriel-Germany is now like a green tunnel of horror, a roller-coaster ride through vast tracks of destroyed nature, a subsidy-grave filled with turbines and panels.	17

1	Well, the debate matters because folks here are saying he lied about his study. That fact that people here argue the conclusions of the study speaks volumes to how important it is.	17
1	Wow ... how harsh and ridged the orthodoxy is protected. You have an eminent scientist with phenomenal, world-renowned credentials. He voices an agnostic view ("We simply don't know for certain") and he's excoriated as if he just argued the world is flat because the flying spaghetti monster told him so in a dream.  I'm sure it won't be long before the most extreme and fervent begin to eat their own for not being "pure" enough.	17

I don't think I've ever seen courses on "How to Debate a Flat-Earther" or "Making Sense of Big Bang Doubters" or "How to Deal with Creationists". Why is Climate Science any different? Don't you think that maybe Climate Science is trying too hard? Why can't we just let good science prevail on its own merits?	17
1	Well, I sure hope they achieve their goal of learning to communicate better.  I can think of 1,000 things they should do.  1, link historical tidal gauge data to your predictions of sea level rise, 2, discuss the million hurricanes that have hit in similar areas over the past 200,000 thousand years and say why any one similar storm is climate change, 3, stop saying our children won't know what snow is, etc., etc.	17

1	Which happens **all the time**, by the way:  http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/warming-links.html  http://www.weather.com/news/news/global-warming-summer-20120703  http://blogs.kxan.com/2013/07/01/global-warming-related-to-australias-hottest-summer/  https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2015/04/more-than-half-of-hot-extremes-due-to-climate-change.html	17
1	Also, [India is shutting them down](http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/05/06/india-charities-greenpeace-idINKBN0NQ25F20150506)	17
1	&gt;We’ve had our own busted predictions. Perhaps the most preposterous was climate alarmist Tim Flannery’s 2005 observation: “If the computer records are right, these drought conditions will become permanent in eastern Australia.” Subsequent rainfall and severe flooding have shown the records or his analysis are wrong. We’ve swallowed dud prediction after dud prediction. What’s more, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which we were instructed was the gold standard on global warming, has been exposed repeatedly for ­mis­rep­resentation and shoddy methods.	17
1	It almost looks like warmer weather and more CO2 would somehow be good for food production. I know, weird, huh?	17
1	Good article (though it's 2 years old).	17
1	Lew writes transparently bad editorials and gets them published in "science" journals as research?  As one of Watts' commenters points out, Lew carps centrally about "unabated" warming, then goes on to admit to a "slowdown," which of course by definition means "abated" from a faster state.   There apparently is no bar low enough to prevent seepage of his propaganda disguised as pseudo-science.  What a shit hole the University of Bristol must be to pay this man to spew.	17
1	&gt;Professor Stephan Lewandowsky, from Bristol’s School of Experimental Psychology.              LOL...	17
1	I appreciate your comment and I will take it into consideration. Meanwhile let me reciprocate by offering equally useful advice to to you: Please comment on /r/climate instead of here; there you will find fellow climate cult members who share your peculiar religious beliefs.	17
1	It is a light at the end of the tunnel that a candidate actually has the balls to take this massive hundreds of billions of funding dollars bull by the horns. And this wont be easy, it wont take just balls. But this guy has brains and a brilliant mouth as well.   Still, I dont fancy his chances too high. The leftist mob, the liberal mass media, will do their usual poop-flinging, their hateful yelling, their childish mocking, their violent "protests", the usual intimidation tactics. Cruz will need strong allies, and the left will do everything and more to try and isolate him.  Im looking forward to this fight.	17
1	&gt;Professor Lewandowsky said: “We scientists...  Speak for yourself, wacko.	17
1	&gt;It seems reasonable to conclude that the pressure of climate contrarians has contributed, at least to some degree, to scientists re-examining their own theory, data and models…  So we skeptics are causing... actual science?    &gt;So why might scientists be affected by contrarian public discourse? The study argues that three ~~recognised~~ *recognized* psychological mechanisms are at work: ‘stereotype threat’, ‘pluralistic ignorance’ and the ‘third-person effect’.  Guess not...  In the world of the climate cult... There is no skepticism allowed, thus ACTUAL science MUST be due to problematic "psychological mechanisms" that are leading scientists "to overstate uncertainty and under-communicate knowledge."	17
1	Did anyone expect anything else?    That said, I'm against government funding of anything unless it can be provably shown to have a positive economic multiplier.  I have a hard time seeing how climate change research could have a positive economic multiplier, Weather... yes. Climate change... no.	17
1	Academic freedom is only for the majority opinion.	17
1	&gt;As climate data continues its stubborn refusal to conform to doomsday models, global-warming activists have focused much of their effort on attempting to discredit critics, apparently in the belief that “science” means suppressing inconvenient information to make hypotheses look better. A major theme running through these efforts is the supposed financial “conflicts of interest” facing scientists whose work is not funded by ideologically pure supporters of catastrophic man-made climate change theories. To put it bluntly, the warmists insist that anyone who disagrees with them is a dishonest puppet of reckless and greedy fossil fuel companies.	17
1	Pollsters, the media and the climate lobby have been utterly gobsmacked after the Torries crush Labour in the UK general election.  Renewables subsidies will be slashed, fracking will be expanded, the economy will thrive, and the climate lobby will be shut out of power for at least another 5 years.  Cheers all round.	17
1	I predict a landslide in most western countries for economically liberal parties(aka conservative/right of center parties).  Globally, people are wise to the BS the left talks.. and the polls show it.  Now if we can only get rid of the war hawk collectivists on the right... we would be golden.	17
1	The philosophy of science is literally the art of logical skepticism.  The art of climate "science" is psychological conditioning that would make Goebbels proud.	17
1	OMG, so much butt-hurt at the Guardian... quite satisfying :-)	17
1	Unfortunately, UKIP did not fare well either (in terms of seats, anyways)	17
1	arent uk conservatives pro carbon tax?	17
1	We're about to find out ...	17
1	What Cameron says and does about climate is very different.	17
1	But any editorial opinion or prediction of earths doom should be read as fact.  Or 97% of the 2% of true believers will get you!!!	17
1	Well how many grants have been given by nasa earth sciences and the federal govt to universities and scientists to follow the warming mantra.   You never hear of an agw denier landing a huge research grant now do you?	17
1	Wow, same as U.S. politics. Democrats, insist their way or the highway and then got clobbered come election time. The media is like "Republicans need to work with Democrats." In the U.K., the environmentalist lackeys get tromped. The major quote in the article is "Conservatives must improve their shaky record on green issues..." Pfft. Sure they do.	17
1	Well at least that solves the problem of the ocean levels rising	17
1	Labour has become the muslim party. Thats why.	17
1	This sums up the cult perfectly.	17
1	It will just shake out the free market haters...	17
1	Such is the state of climate "skepticism" in the brave new world of climate McCarthyism they are busily creating, folks.  Because nothing says "skepticism" and critical thinking like attacking the person, not the content.  Don't go there and vote people.  Just point and laugh.	17
1	That is all they can do..  They can not dispute the state of play at this time.	17
1	Last few times I posted to /r/skeptic one of the regulars came out of  the woodwork accusing me of being a racist or a nazi or something (apparently I'm on one of those "lists"). Despite my requests for supporting evidence, my posts were severely downvoted just based on that accusation. So much for the so called skeptics. The mods aren't the only cancer there -- the whole place is a cesspool.	17
1	they are so in love with the idea, they can't let it go. people don't love the truth, people try to "make true" that which they love...yes, even "scientists" do this.	17
1	Serious question: Why do so few people pay attention to these inconvenient truths?	17
1	I love to watch the warmists dance.	17
1	Your grandpa was a wise man.	17
1	Yeah, but if we deny energy expansion to Africans we can probably prevent a good three, maybe four hundredths of a degree warming by 2100.  Who *wouldn't* think consigning hundreds of millions of people to shorter, more brutish and desperate lives in exchange for that is a good idea?  I mean, c'mon deniers.  You gotta have priorities.  Imperceptibly less warming eighty five years from now for millions kept in abject poverty today.  It's a fair deal.	17
1	&gt; Who wouldn't think consigning hundreds of millions of people to shorter, more brutish and desperate lives in exchange for that is a good idea?  Well, they're "brown people", so to the enviro-elites they don't count as human.  I wish I was joking, but fundamentally *that* is their position.	17
1	&gt;Africa is where the population BOOM is going to happen.  It's [already *been* happening... for decades now.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria#Demographics) (Would you like to [know even more...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Nigeria))  And quite frankly, regardless of the delusions of the "enviro-elites" they're NOT going to be able to stop it (nor even really "slow" it much) via some "treaties" or "agreements".	17
1	They're just anti-human. They assign more inherent worth to "nature" (whatever that means) than to humans (apparently humans exist outside of nature), be they black or white. If they had a choice to press a button which kills off 90-99% of humans, many of them would press it without a second thought.	17
1	The *alleged* externalities of fossil fuels.  Take away the already solved problem of particulate pollution, and the rest of the eco-apocalypse is derived from falsified climate models and pseudoscience surrounding the term 'species'.	17
1	From the Wikipedia link you posted:  &gt; On October 25, **Sandy hit Cuba** as a Category 3 hurricane, **then weakened to a Category 1 hurricane**.  This article talks about hurricanes in the US. Sandy had winds of 80 mph when it made landfall in New Jersey, which according to the [Hurricane Wind Scale](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php) is Category 1.  ̶W̶h̶o̶'̶s̶ ̶l̶y̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶h̶e̶r̶e̶?̶	17
1	I missed the "in the US" portion. Honest mistake.	17
1	FTA:  &gt;But you can be sure that when the current drought in U.S. major hurricane strikes ends, that, too, will be blamed on humans.  You can take that one to the bank.	17
1	Indeed. Because it will actually be because of a prevailing warm phase of a well-understood climatological cycle called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which was what was responsible for hyperactivity with numerous major landfalling hurricanes from 1995 onwards (and in the period 1926-1969), not GW.	17
1	&gt; The projected effects of global warming on hurricane formation and intensity are minimal  then why does nearly every climate scientists and alarmist out there have a history of saying, "hurricanes will be stronger and more frequent?"	17
1	Oh yeah, A̶l̶ ̶G̶o̶r̶e̶, M̶i̶c̶h̶a̶e̶l̶ ̶M̶a̶n̶n̶, S̶t̶e̶p̶h̶a̶n̶ ̶L̶e̶w̶a̶n̶d̶o̶w̶s̶k̶y̶, John Cook is so much better!	17
1	Hey!  Thanks for adding an informative comment to the discussion.  I mean that.	17
1	I love how they claim "there's no evidence the models as wrong".  Um, sure, because unless someone has invented a time machine there is no way to do that. But making unfalsifiable claims doesn't mean they are right, either.  Further, they rather gloss over the fact that while there is no (impossible) evidence that proves them wrong over the long term, there *is* plenty of evidence that they are wrong *now*.  Why on earth should the default position be these things are correct in their predictions for the future when they are almost totally wrong today?  Total absurdity.	17
1	Absolutely, and for the exact reasons you mention. Hurricanes' windfields expanding as they undergo baroclinic interaction is absolutely ordinary, and hybrid systems making landfall in the Northeast were very frequent in the '40s and '50s.  Not only that, but there's fully tropical cyclones which exceed the size of Sandy as well. The only tropical cyclone-specific reporting that's offended me more in recent years was calling Haiyan the strongest typhoon...	17
1	Here's one about GHGs emitted by the metallic inputs of  various types of energy: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/renewable-energys-hidden-costs/  Here's one about integrating intermittent sources into the grid:  https://theconversation.com/counting-the-hidden-costs-of-energy-12710  The key tables from the latter:   Price at 10% penetration:  $/MWh|Low|High|Mid :-------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------: Nuclear|1.7|3.1|2.4 Coal|0.5|1.3|0.9 Gas|0.3|0.6|0.5 Onshore Wind|16.3|20.5|18.4 Offshore Wind|20.5|36.0|28.3 Solar PV|14.8|57.9|36.4  Here are the prices at 30% penetration:  $/MWh|Low|High|Mid :-------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------: Nuclear|1.4|2.8|2.1 Coal|0.5|1.3|0.9 Gas|0.3|0.6|0.5 Onshore Wind|19.8|43.9|31.8 Offshore Wind|28.3|45.4|36.8 Solar PV|28.3|83.0|55.6	17
1	[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/35hpec/engineers_in_the_netherlands_say_a_novel_solar/cr4in6o) is the top comment on the same story on /r/technology. No further comments needed.	17
1	&gt; [...] the summary for policy makers, the only part of the report read by international organizations, politicians and media is **written under the very close supervision of the representative of the countries and of the non-governmental pressure groups**.  Ugh...	17
1	Point 16 isn't right.   I looked in the comments expecting to see a reaction, and was pleased to see *rgbatduke* (that's Physics Prof. Robert G. Brown of Duke University) address it.   http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/05/12/22-very-inconvenient-climate-truths/#comment-1932077	17
1	&gt;1) anthropogenic CO2 is trivial.      2) CO2’s impact on the climate is trivial.      3) IPCC’s models don’t work.            The rest is unnecessary noise.        Best of the Comments.        Sure there are problems with several of the 22 arguments made, but over all this is enough to bring all of our assumptions into question.	17
1	Even people who write for HuffPo are trying to distance themselves from Klein's particular brand of crazy:  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/till-bruckner/naomi-klein-climate-chang_b_7148090.html  I've tried to engage with the anti-capitalists a few times to try to understand what they are thinking.  I have yet to get a clear picture of the alternative they think will replace capitalism.	17
1	I often wonder, does it even make sense to compare any kind of local observations to the long term average? I think Willie Soon said it best: **the average American has one boob and one testicle**.	17
1	She is the textbook definition of champaign socialist.  The very system that she decries is the one she exploits, routinely, to make money to be a global jet-setter. So she is a hypocrite on a massive scale on multiple levels.  Worse, it's like she lives in opposite world. Virtually everything she claims about economics, the opposite is true.  How or why anybody takes her even remotely seriously as this point is beyond me.	17
1	I'm also the tallest I've ever been since I was born. And the last 13 years have all been record years for my height! At this rate I expect to be taller than Shaquille O'Neal by 2020.	17
1	This is the warmest friday before a saturday on an even date in january 30 days after a blizzard, ever.	17
1	&gt;This is not climate denial of the Republican sort, where people simply pretend the science isn’t real. This is climate denial of the status quo sort, where people accept the science, and indeed make long speeches about the immorality of passing on a ruined world to our children. They just deny the meaning of the science, which is that we must keep carbon in the ground.  Obama is the best Republican President of my lifetime.	17
1	Because it's funny Muffy, because it's funny.	17
1	**Et tu, Brute?** This is priceless! There is so much cognitive dissonance when the reality doesn't match the utopia in one's mind!	17
1	&gt; and indeed make long speeches   Does The NY Times not know how politics and politicians work? Was Bill McKibben born yesterday?	17
1	&gt; And his nonbinding pledge that America will cut emissions in future decades may ~~make~~ ensure that the upcoming climate talks in Paris ~~less of~~ are a fiasco ~~than~~ similar to earlier talks in Copenhagen.  FTFY Bill.  No, no, the pleasure is all mine.	17
1	Nothing will ever be Copenhagen level fiasco again unfortunately, the levels of expectation are far too lowered.	17
1	And Obama said "Hell Yeah, I'm going to let Shell drill in the Arctic, what are the climate activists going to do? Vote Republican?"  *Obama may not have actually said this*	17
1	The sounds of a thousand journalist keyboards can be heard, writing updates to their series of posts about the plucky young teens, who'd forced the government to act on climate change.  *Just kidding, they'll completely ignore this inglorious defeat and the precedent it sets*	17
1	Bill Nye is like the Ronald McDonald of climate change.	17
1	There's reality, and there's the liberal fantasy narrative. The reality is, coal and oil are  how we get our power. They're cheap, clean, and we know how to extract and handle them. You don't just shut down our existing power sources for some fantasy pipe dream. Obama is a lying idiot, but even he knows that.	17
1	&gt; a lying idiot, but even he knows that  so true. LOL  people like him are like jackals or hyenas. They just don't care about truth, because they know the other jackals in their pack don't care about it either. It's all R-selection, they plan to collectively get what they want	17
1	Actually he's more like the Beavis &amp; Butthead of "science".  Edit: With apologies to the genius that is Mike Judge; I meant more that (like Beavis &amp; Butthead) Nye is a "cartoonish caricature".	17
1	Do not defile the work of Mike Judge in such a way!!!!!    Edit:  apologies accepted	17
1	Ugh... the circle jerking is nauseating...	17
1	Bill has done more to discredit the cult of climate hysteria then any denier, except maybe Al Gore.  Most rational adults grow out of watching TV shows about clowns.	17
1	Came from this article.   http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/11/antarcticas-increasing-sea-ice-restricting-access-to-research-stations?CMP=ema_632  The article itself is surprisingly tame, considering the source, but when i got the the bottom of it... I spit my drink everywhere.	17
1	LOL  here, enjoy - http://takimag.com/article/the_theology_of_climate_change_theodore_dalrymple	17
1	Expect it to be full of climate change propaganda.  Don't forget he stands to personally make a fortune from the Crown's rights and cut on off-shore windfarms.	17
1	But its not the worst drought...what lies.  Of course what do you expect from a source which is too chicken to even allow comments on articles.  Even NASA says 1934 was much worse.  http://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/10/14/nasa-study-finds-1934-had-worst-drought-of-last-thousand-years/	17
1	New research is imminent that will show that we miscalculated the size of the sea ice in the past, and that this "record high" sea ice is actually a record low.  Everyone panic now!  I don't know of any actual research as such, but the alarmist community is so desperate for something like that, its inevitable that some psuedo-proxy bullshit study will claim it sooner or later.	17
1	The melt is mostly on one little peninsula.  How does that freshwater make it all around Antarctica so evenly?	17
1	Can we also apply pressure to call the believers 'idiots?'	17
1	I've always wanted to live in *1984*	17
1	Alinsky Rules for Radicals:  "Ridicule is your most potent weapon."	17
1	&gt;Some clear evidence that it was actually warming would be a start.  &gt;As would some evidence of the vitally important water vapor feedback, not to mention the tropospheric hot spot.  &gt;Oh, and some climate models that actually WORKED.  I like Judith Curry's conclusions at the end of her article.	17
1	Time for Abbott to refound the Climate Commission and put Lomberg as its head.	17
1	I like this one, it shows what they are doing now down to a tee.  I'll post some maps, name some science guy, and we will call it the truth!!!	17
1	&gt;Wait you actually read the National Geographic article?   Unlikely. There has been an upsurge of the kind of soft focus comments above, where the poster affects an authoritative position, throws about a few keywords, and says basically nothing.	17
1	&gt; As scientists it is no longer sufficient to simply arrive at an estimate; we must bound our estimates with some level of confidence.  Just for the record - it was *2015* before they made this breakthrough in climate studies.	17
1	Freeman Dyson theorized about using nuclear propulsion in, among other places, the upper atmosphere. I'm sure your ideas for interplanetary travel are better.	17
1	Your planet is ruined. Mine is better than ever.	17
1	&gt;The whole point of science is to encourage disagreement and keep an open mind.  That sums up exactly what I don't like the whole "consensus" idea about science.	17
1	Ugh, Connor's emails are so annoying and frustrating to read. All he does is Appeal to Authority and Pascal's Wager. I found Dyson's last email very satisfying. And it's literally like an atheist/agnostic arguing with a religious fanatic.	17
1	Yup, Carl Sagan had an almost religious belief in a nuclear holocaust. He even  predicted that the Gulf War Kuwaiti Oil fires would generate a catastrophic nuclear winter  with continental sized impacts of "sub-freezing" temperatures. But at least Sagan was legit scientist with over 300 peer-reviewed publications, whereas Reddit sex-symbol Neil Degrasse Tyson has about a dozen.	17
1	I'm curious.  Did they film this in an actual location, or was it all CG?  If it was an actual location, then those landscapes already exist.  Surely she isn't so dumb to think the whole world will become desert.	17
1	And when the oil-well fires didn't turn out like he expected, he changed his views. Lesson, there.	17
1	"Do you agree with me?" &lt;insert any answer&gt;. "So you agree with me."	17
1	Still Conner published the interview despite getting his ass handed to him in a pretty embarassing way, let alone giving a heretic a platform. Hat off to that.	17
1	Its collapse "would significantly contribute to global sea level rise"   We need numbers, not alarmism.  Are we talking a whole millimeter ocean's rise here, or much less?	17
1	It seems to me it's been shrinking since the end of the last ice age. I think I even read about explorers around 1900 reporting parts were collapsing away. This would be before any significant Co2.	17
1	It is only a matter of time before the FCC gets involved in Website content.	17
1	&gt;they already give the science (turned climate) sub special privileges  How so?  AFAICT, the science sub is run within the latitude given to moderators  (Some of whom have taken that subreddit to an almost-hilarious extreme, at least when it comes to any talk about climate).	17
1	There is always [voat.co](https://voat.co/) ;-)	17
1	If there are any here who agree that 100% reduction of net GHGs is possible, I'm curious how you think this will be accomplished.  I looked at the document provided at the site, but it gave no clear pathway.  How would you do it?  In fact, even if you don't think it's necessary to reduce GHGs (a little or at all), how would you go about it?	17
1	&gt; Ban all use of fossil fuels.  Well, except for the army.  You'll need them mobile when the food riots start.	17
1	Also known as full something or other.	17
1	also, every living organism is gonna have to stop breathing	17
1	Only a weak case needs to be bolstered with propaganda tactics,.	17
1	Thanks for posting this! Very interesting to read about the rhetorical fight bring waged, which very well may be the front lines in the battle for climate science!	17
1	Closed minded, ideologically wacko, foaming at the mouth batshit crazy- but yeah, not immature.	17
1	I prefer to think of them as Alarmists, or Zealots, or perhaps Cultists.  Most of them are just sadly misinformed and missing most of the information;  we see this kind of "wedded to the idea so much they ignore all else" from time to time.	17
1	Chicken Little had unadjusted hard acorn data and a falsifiable hypothesis: no comparison whatsoever.	17
1	Off topic because the political class has distanced itself from the movement. Pfft.  /r/Politics is working overtime to keep their bubble secure.	17
1	Morons. Morons everywhere.	17
1	I made the mistake of pointing out facts and how China is rapidly increasing Co2 emissions (massively!) and I think they deleted my post!  Ugh.. just amazing. I marvel at this bizarre 'fake China' they are creating - this environmentalist king thats 'showing up' the greedy Western wasters.  meanwhile... i do believe none of us will even know HOW MUCH pollution increases in China. I mean.. you just get the official reports. Which reports massive massive increases year after years (so they should btw).	17
1	This was also a winter of 2013-2014 comparison against 2014-2015.  Last year's winter was one of the coldest in decades in China.  I made a post pointing that out.  We'll see if it gets deleted.	17
1	Not even halfway through the year and it's the Hottest Year Evah!^TM	17
1	Their economy is imploding.	17
1	Isn't this exactly what is supposed to happen?  Didn't President Obama promise exactly this?	17
1	&gt;The message is always, "We're running out of time; we've only got five or 10 years to turn things around, but we can do it if we put our minds to it."  &gt;That was the message in 1990, in 2000, in 2010. How can we still have five or 10 years left? The answer, Geden says, is that scientists are baking increasingly unrealistic assumptions into their models.	17
1	In short:    1. we dont deny facts. We just dont believe in their predictions. Predictions are not facts.   2. In the worst case humans will return all the CO2 back into the atmosphere that plants once took out of it. Back when all the now fossile carbon was still atmospheric CO2, has there been a "runaway" greenhouse effect? Obviously not.   3. No living thing can live without leaving a mark on its environment. All living things multiply until no more increase is possible. It is the most natural thing. Cutting our life line fossile fuel is as logical as comitting suicide out of fear of death.	17
1	... since the BBC had their way with him. Read his past, he has been very sceptical of catastrophic climate change.	17
1	When did the Guardian get overrun by climate clerics? They have a new climate excuse/fear article every day now.	17
1	"If you torture the data long enough, it will confess." -- Ronald Coase	17
1	&gt;Rare joint statement by world’s first and third biggest carbon emitters calls on developed countries to honour pledge of $100bn annual climate aid by 2020  Its totally not about the money though.	17
1	The question I've always brought up about all Mad Max movies. If in fact we are running out of oil, why in lords name would you have a supercharged big block V8? Don't those burn a fairly large amount of fuel? Would it not be a better solution to use, I don't know, a diesel engine which can run on peanut oil (or veggie oil as well as others). I get it looks awesome and sounds amazing but still, really?	17
1	Hey *kriegson* do you have anything to do with this *kriging*? ;-)	17
1	Much like the original series, logic goes out the window because big block V8s are awesome and deep down, nobody likes vegan hippies.	17
1	The first three words of the article you posted link to [the paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/10/5/054007) (my highlighting):  &gt; We present an updated version of the radiosonde dataset homogenized by **Iterative Universal Kriging (IUKv2)**, now extended through February 2013, following the method used in the original version (Sherwood et al 2008 Robust tropospheric warming revealed by iteratively homogenized radiosonde data J. Clim. 21 5336–52). This method, in effect, performs a multiple linear regression of the data onto a structural model that includes both natural variability, trends, and time-changing instrument biases, thereby avoiding estimation biases inherent in traditional homogenization methods.	17
1	Sometimes you gotta just blow sh*t up.	17
1	&gt; For one, why would the rain cease to exist and the earth become nothing but a desert? With rising sea levels (and an increase in ocean surface area) and higher temperatures, I would believe that some places will be getting more than enough rain  They stopped calling it the "greenhouse effect" for a reason, it was bad marketing.  Greenhouses mean plant growth and life.  Can't scare people with that phrase.	17
1	"We told you there would be fewer hurricanes!"  Must be nice to be able to say 'I told you so' no matter how wrong your predictions were.	17
1	Seems they've finally grown too ashamed to base their forecasts on climate change propaganda needs, only to seem them go wrong.	17
1	I see you met my spouse.	17
1	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad  Yea, kinda fits.  If a scientist goes against your religion... take him out!!!	17
1	Give it a week, and the news media will start spitting out that the lack of hurricanes will damage local fisheries up and down the coast.  The water will become stagnated and fish will have massive kill offs.  And all of this is because of CLIMATE CHANGE!!	17
1	Just their careers and reputations if they don't play along....	17
1	I'm pretty sure I understand climate change now:    If it gets hotter its climate change. If it gets colder its climate change. If we have more hurricanes its climate change. If we have less hurricanes its climate change. If the ice caps melt its climate change. If the ice caps increase its climate change. If the oceans rise its climate change. If the oceans decrease its climate change. If we have droughts its climate change. If we have heavy rain and flooding its climate change.    I think I got it now.	17
1	Up until that point, all criticism was silenced. ClimateGate opened the door to dissent. Besides, the fraud goes way deeper then that but zealots have eyes and can't see. They have ears but can't hear.	17
1	Academic freedom is only for the popular kids.	17
1	Nice article, another blow against science.    Modern witch hunts, nothing less.	17
1	Lomborg's crime was making bigots feel like crap about themselves.  They can only respond with more bigotry.   In the long run, this episode is highly enlightening -- and should be publicized.	17
1	Clearly he doesn't need to answer these questions because climate change is unquestionable!   ^^^/s	17
1	As I've said before science is and will forever based in skepticism. If one isn't skeptical about the findings of others then there is no point to having science, there is no point in trying to prove anything wrong. This is a sad day for science.	17
1	Throw it on the "reasons for the pause" pile.	17
1	Can't be on much today (doing sciency-stuff that some of my trolls don't believe I do) but just had to post this.	17
1	There is no more unscientific cabal than the low information climate change mafia.	17
1	The only thing dangerous about "climate change" are the policies the eco-nazis propose to "fix" climate change.  We are only fucked if people are stupid enough to give in to the hysterical extremists.	17
1	The article brushes so close to the truth that it's hard to tell satire from reality. It took me a second when I read the title.	17
1	The Onion is starting to do climate change satire now? That's a good sign.	17
1	Why not? Everyone else is.	17
1	Welcome, good to have you here and thanks for your post.	17
1	Bernie Sanders is a long-time committed Socialist of the old school; the goal of global warming is political and it fits his ideology. He's in it for the end game payoff of what it promises to bring. No surprise there.	17
1	I feel sorry for my former state. It is experiencing the perfect storm created by the confluence of a 4-year drought and a 20-year rule by leftist ideologues. Like watching a train-wreck, it's interesting to observe from a safe distance who or what survives after this is all over.	17
1	When Hollywood started mocking climate change it was a sign for *the beginning of the end*...	17
1	Just in case I get misinterpreted here, it's still my position that certain people, however, most certainly are fucked *because of climate change*.  Need to make sure I'm unpopular on *both* these subreddits :).	17
1	That's ridiculous.  Greenpeace would never do anything unethical like fake evidence or damage historic and/or cultural sites.	17
1	What? A leftist, liberal organization faking their evidence? Who ever heard of such a thing? I'm shocked, I  tell you, shocked.	17
1	Thinking of starting a blog that archives all these reports of climate data fraud. It's getting out of control, and is seriously damaging the credibility of all sciences. I catch myself doubting even the most robust, objective scientific discoveries now because of how corrupted the field of climate science has become.	17
1	the only thing that would be surprising would be to find out that they *weren't* doing anything unethical or deliberately misleading.	17
1	NASA is infested with Alarmists and Alarmists pray for destructive hurricanes.	17
1	WTF...   these people need to be put in Jail.	17
1	When I first heard Rick Perry say that he'd dismantle the EPA if he became president I thought he was koo-koo, but lately... I don't know... I think there are more koo-koo's in the EPA than anywhere else...	17
1	It has effectively become a joint operation of government and green interest groups.	17
1	You're a personality-challenged fruitcake, but I don't want you locked up (or even forum-banned).  That's because I am a better person than you.  ... unlike eco-fascists, skeptics are not afraid of debates.	17
1	He knows weather because he is checking the forecast for the course.	17
1	You must love all the responses you get. Keep up the hilarious work. Some of us 'get it'.	17
1	The leader of the free world is a talented public speaker with a background in community organization and a great speech writer. you could fill a library with what he doesn't know.	17
1	At this point I can't help but wonder, is Obama the worst president ever?	17
1	The difference between me and Obama though is that I cannot ruin an entire country with my ignorance.	17
1	I'd put him in the bottom ten, and he certainly loses points for presiding over such a marked decline, if not the fin de siècle of "America." Still, he's standing on the shoulders of far greater Progressive luminaries and notables. An impotent, ignorant, and ignoble leader such as Obama was baked into the cake generations ago.	17
1	I honestly wonder if he himself believes everything he says. I mean, come on, climate change is the greatest challenge of our time? Did we fix unemployment, outdated infrastructure, healthcare, education, the war on drugs, etc? Poll after poll shows that climate change scores very low on American's concerns, so whose president is he anyway? I thought that's all politicians care about, opinion polls! /smh  Edit: grammar	17
1	The Obama Presidency will be the benchmark failure against which future failures will be measured for generations.  He is the today's version of Guy de Lusignan.	17
1	You left out world-class liar. Obama is the most gifted liar I've ever seen.	17
1	No, your incompetent policies did that Mr. Obama.	17
1	I can do this too.  Aliens created Muslim terrorist cells.	17
1	During the last 18+ years when there was no change in global temperature?	17
1	The heat is there, you just can't see it, measure it, or record it, but trust us.... it's there!!!	17
1	So in other words, you are confirming that he was indeed a lead author. Also, if being a petrol engineer does not give him the requisite expertise, why did the IPCC commission him in the first place?	17
1	I knew this was objective and scientific when I saw the 'Number of McDonalds Restaurants' chart.	17
1	Ad hom -- addressing the person instead of the point.	17
1	You did note the comment he replied to, yes?  You can't cry "Gish Gallop!" for one and not the other.	17
1	Well now, *that's* inconvient for the Alarmists.  He's right of course--there's little to no evidence supporting the manmade hypothesis.    Let's watch as the man whom the Alarmists once praised is attacked by the armchair scientists!	17
1	Don't forget battery disposal!	17
1	The first and fifth bullet points are mutually exclusive, barring an atrocity.	17
1	Don't forget the amazing amount of energy, mining, and chemical waste that goes into *creating* the batteries.  Electric cars do have benefits, but they're not the green panacea they're made out to be.	17
1	1. They're being honest 2. They're considering nuclear energy  This puts them in the top 0.1% of warmists.	17
1	I'm on disability.. just the tax subsidy that the *buyer* gets, is roughly $14,000,  nearly twice the amount I'm afforded to live on for a year.	17
1	Which is, in fact, what the cited article says ...  &gt; Our bottom line: the identifiable influence of human-caused climate change on recent drought conditions in the Fertile Crescent was almost certainly not the so-called straw that broke the camel’s back and led to the outbreak of conflict in Syria. The pre-existing (political) climate in the region was plenty hot enough for a conflict to ignite, perhaps partly fuelled by recent drought conditions—conditions which are part and parcel of the region climate and the intensity and frequency of which remain dominated by natural variability, even in this era of increasing greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.	17
1	It is astonishing that anyone would seriously float such a claim and be listened to. That the President of the U.S. would do so says a lot about just how blinkered and uninterested in actual truth he is.  It's a propaganda war now being fought at the highest levels of the U.S. government against its own people.  A ridiculous shame, all of it.	17
1	I just did. Less people are going to have to support more people. Or you don't understand how the economy and social security programs work?	17
1	Yeah, but if you use mathmagic to take warmer temperatures from somewhere else and kinda... smear them into the troposphere, then it turns out there totally *is* a hotspot there.  And that's real, that's a fact.  Why trust your lying measurements and observations when they don't tell you what you want, when the wonder of applied statistics (you gotta cherry-pick the exact technique first, natch) does?  It's *science* people.  Love it or *you* are a filthy denier.	17
1	Science is all about adjusting the data to fit the theory.	17
1	&gt;you gotta cherry-pick the exact technique first, natch  That is what real statisticians are actually obliged to do. You chose your test beforehand, apply it, and you must take what you get.  What these clowns apparently have done is to iteratively tweak and adjust the statistical techniques and data until the result they want just happens to pop out. Needless to say, this is a big no-no in statistics, and very much in bad faith.	17
1	Appeal to authority is the safe harbor of the ignorant warmist.  They say, "Yeah, so you're smarter than ALL those scientists?," and shut off reasoning of their own.    Also prevalent is the non-sequitur argument that Arctic glaciers are melting, therefore uncontrovertible evidence the planet is doomed.  It impossible for them to imagine glaciers melting harmlessly after a Little Ice Age.	17
1	nah dude, if everything in the world doesnt remain exactly the same its 1) our fault  and 2)we all gonna die	17
1	While that is true...  it is also has many anti-modernism and anti-capitalist sentiments.     CAGW just gives them a battle cry.   They don't give a dam about science,  once you understand that, there is no point in reasoning with them.	17
1	It is a faith - prior data about the Medieval Warm Period and last interglacial being hotter than now and that we aren't heating up since 2000 are irrelevant.   All live in poverty for the sake of Mother Earth, obey the priests who get to travel to the human-free edens the peons aren't allowed to see, ideally living child-free but free to have sex while sacrificing all for the sake of the logic-free deity.	17
1	Alarmists used to be quick to point out that "weather is not climate".	17
1	The far left has to inject their pernicious views into everything everywhere or nobody would bother to think about them.   That is the case when views are incoherent and lack reason, you must promote them.	17
1	That prognostication pretty much sums up what passes for global warming science.  Andrew Dessler is described as a climate scientist and Professor of Atmospheric Sciences. One wonders about this 'science' when a global warming science luminary like Dessler makes such profoundly wrong predictions. Most people would be embarrassed, apologize and work to retool their prognostication models; that doesn't seem to be the case here on all 3 counts.	17
1	"Utterly  clueless buffoon".  Every time someone cites Dessler this should be quoted.	17
1	His science ineptitude and mindless bloviations are in the Algore-level category. Bill Nye is equivalent to ten thousand global warming skeptics in the good work he does unintentionally generating doubt and ridicule about this political movement.	17
1	I thought patriotism was bad this year -- that's what all the cultural Marxists tell me.	17
1	never let the public forget:  [Paper proves Bill Nye's faked 'greenhouse effect' experiment is also based on the wrong 'basic physics' ](http://hockeyschtick.blogspot.com/2014/08/paper-proves-bill-nyes-faked-greenhouse.html)	17
1	Um....  http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Texas-is-vulnerable-to-warming-climate-2079164.php  Sorry, but your guys are (at best) sending mixed messages.  There's some *slight* advantage to that in that whatever happens you can point to it and yell "global warming!"--but mostly it just makes Alarmists look like religious zealots.	17
1	Just saw [this picture of Austin downtown](http://i.imgur.com/SB68hoQ.jpg) taken this afternoon.	17
1	Dude, come on, you can't predict drought and heavy precipitation at the same time and be taken seriously. That would be like a doctor saying *I give you a 50% chance of dying and a 50% chance of living* and then taking credit either way.	17
1	Oh yes, global warming predicts everything including complete opposites. That is the beauty of global warming, if it's a drought, it was predicted; if it floods, well,.. it was predicted as well!  Global warming is so special it can be anything including complete opposites; the impediment of logic is thrown away!  How can any person believe in this crap and still consider themselves reasoning beings is beyond me.	17
1	~~Climate Change~~  ~~Climate Change Denial~~  Climate Change Deniers are a Threat to National Security.	17
1	&gt;“There is no strategy, and anybody who says there is, I’d like to hear what it is,” McCain said, appearing on CBS News. “Because it certainly isn’t apparent. Right now we are seeing these horrible reports, in Palmyra, they’re executing people and leaving their bodies in the streets.  &gt;“Meanwhile the president of the United States is saying that the biggest problem we have is climate change.”	17
1	It's ~~disingenuous~~ funny how he uses area to measure Arctic ice and mass for Antarctic ice.	17
1	When they use the phrase "extreme threat", I might worry. It's like they're not even trying anymore.	17
1	Echo chambers? Isn't that what happens when you shut down debate &amp; ban people you disagree with?	17
1	As Tim Ball pointed out (if I recall) it seems some people really need religion. In lieu of traditional types, many people these days are turning to climate change to give them purpose and a sense of moral superiority.	17
1	Self-righteous people are drawn to causes which enable them to be self-righteous.	17
1	Hey look, 97% made it in the first paragraph...  Is it 2011 again?	17
1	They just keep using it, even though it's been exploded as phony for years and years.	17
1	Agreed....I'm kinda more worried about the people who want to rape my wife and chop off my head than a theoretical hundredths-of-a-degree change in the climate.	17
1	I first heard of him on Discovery Channel as "The Bad Astronomer" and at that time I thought it was funny, but now I realize it was an apt description.	17
1	It should come as no surprise that many of our baser instincts that were once expressed through religion are now expressed in another guise.  Take natural disasters, for example. At one time, people ascribed them to divine retribution for man's wicked behavior.  Alarmists still maintain this simple anthropocentric view of the world. That is, they attribute natural disasters as mother nature's punishment against man for befouling the environment with his evil C02.	17
1	Yeah, but climate change caused Obama's daughter to develop asthma.	17
1	&gt; 97% of the ones that had a position said man was at least partially at fault.  Not actually true.  No attribution statement was needed.  To **not** qualify as the 97%, the paper had to claim AGW wasn't real **and** propose an alternative mechanism for the warming, natural variability didn't count.	17
1	Your point makes the 97% claim even more absurd.	17
1	Are you now, or have you ever been, a Climate Change denier?  Have you ever bought stock in, or financially contributed to, any Koch owned business, gas, oil, or coal business?  Do you or do you not use privately owned transportation?	17
1	How dare you use that model!!!    Please use the future models that have been adjusted.    Thanks	17
1	[this is pretty good](http://business.financialpost.com/fp-comment/claim-that-97-of-scientists-support-climate-alarm-cannot-be-supported). in a Canadian financial paper yesterday	17

0	Because in the End, Life will find a way.   All this talk about, about extinction and tipping is non constructive and boring.              Ring the bells too loud and people go deaf.	17
0	well illogical didn't seem to think this would happen. And where do I make it seem like a revelation?	17
0	Why can't we just use the one that get caught in oil spills and fry them up?	17
0	They own space. Raising money shouldn't be an issue.	17
0	Which is why you need some form of enforcement mechanism to stop profiteering.	17
0	They are not cutting only global warming research, they are cutting all Earth sciences from NASA. This is the kind of data that is used to track blizzards and hurricanes, tsunamis and the expansion of earthquakes. It is also used to make weather forecasting, track dust storms, ice cover, land usage, bird migration among others. No other agency has the money or the knowledge to do so. If you want to gut global warming research from NASA just say so and be clear. This approach is shortsighted and leaves the US exposed to disaster. This is being sold as global warming, it is not.	17
0	No it is not. This is the data that is telling you whether it is going to rain tomorrow. It is not an experiment of any sort. The cuts will cripple our ability to do weather forecast. This is not global warming research. Skeptics should be against them as well. It is this data that ultimately will show whether every scientist is an idiot. You love to quote the satellite record to show that there has been little warming over the last decade. Guess what, there would not be such record without the NASA Earth sciences grogram. This is not political. This is the kind of data that keep us safe.	17
0	With what money and what motivation? Everything is being cut and sent to space research. Private contractors doing earth science still feed on tax payers money. Other than that, what non-government company would spent 150 million to put a satellite into orbit just too see how much liquid is there in the clouds or what the temperature is at their tops? This is crucial data for weather models but it does not have an immediate profit (but a huge long term one) that a private company could exploit. As for NASA, they still have a reputation of being the best at what they do, I don't think anyone challenges that.	17
0	Whatever your position is on AGW you must agree that only data will settle the argument. We should not stop collecting it. There are many other reasons besides AGW why we need to keep studying the Earth.	17
0	And yet we appear poised to break the annual global surface temperature record. Again.  You would almost think that sunspot cycle isn't the primary driver of the climate right now.	17
0	Wrong. Less than 1 % of NASA budget is dedicated to global warming research. Supplying ISS was supposed to be done by american private companies like spacex which still are having a hard time catching up. Whatever your position is on AGW the cuts are irresponsible. You think it is punishing NASA for not agreeing with the right while in reality it will decimate our ability to do basic things like weather forecast. Does anyone here know what Earth sciences are? Or everybody thinks it is all global warming research?	17
0	So according to him NASA must be defunded for not believing NASA data that NASA scientists created using NASA satellites. I don't follow Steven Goddard blog but, is he always this much of a moron?	17
0	You didn't even address his issue in his comment...	17
0	Lol, these deniers and their high school science skills. It is literally hilarious. Try the opposite, cool water to -20 C in absence of anything else. See how water "reacts" to try to come back to equilibrium, but don't hold your breath.	17
0	Also his lake examples are embarrassing and show his lack of knowledge about how bodies of water can behave when they change temperatures.	17
0	I think you misunderstood what he said... but good job trying to sound smart.	17
0	It  freezes at -36 C. Stop embarrassing yourself.	17
0	Or him "forgetting" that lakes undergo stratification, so a lake will rarely ever be a single temperature  (unless the water at the top of the lake is 4C obviously). Which means right from the very beginning his examples are wrong.	17
0	Ok. That prediction was very accurate given that +2 is the best estimate of warming from our historical emissions now in 2015 (8 years later). What is your point?	17
0	NPR shouldn't be giving air-time to the anti-science fringe.	17
0	I'm saying that this guy doesn't understand the well known stratification that lakes undergo.	17
0	At least we don't think the temperature of the entire lake will be 0C, unlike you deniers.	17
0	The onus is on you to prove that now. The predictions made in that article are perfectly consistent with what we know today. My evidence is in the link you posted and then basically every IPCC report since then, the current NASA website, etc. all just open public knowledge.   The most likely situation is that you read it wrong, but that's up to you prove otherwise.	17
0	Hello there!  John answered here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/34tcge/science_ama_series_i_am_john_cook_climate_change/cqyr85v  I had a go myself at some of the questions here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/34tcge/science_ama_series_i_am_john_cook_climate_change/cqym0x0  Please "Reply" to either if you are worried that any concerns were not sufficiently addressed!	17
0	Don't worry everyone, Sherlocks on the case.	17
0	What does this have to do with current climate change? Is it a general attack on contemporary climatologists based on a NYT article from 40 years ago?  *I can't reply because people are downvoting my posts. Is this how you win your arguments?	17
0	I am sorry, but could you explain what this graphic is meant to represent? Also, where did you get it? What is the context? Is there some peer reviewed scientifical publication that explains and corroborates it? The same applies for your alegation that the publications of NSIDC are lies. Can you present any proof for that?	17
0	I'm not sure which "him" you mean there. Are you saying that because that question was answered in John's second round of answers, people chose to "dismiss" John?  That would be a shame. But I wonder that such behavior may not just be a pretext to ignore information/a source that challenges one's worldview AKA motivated reasoning.  I don't know what "crusher crew" means. I have worked with John on several projects, including the MOOC through edX and the Cook et al. (2013) paper on the consensus.	17
0	Relax. Is called homogeneous ice nucleation. Water does not freeze at -20 C because there are kinetic constraints to it. Only at -36 C the thermodynamic driving force is high enough to overcome those. Thus how most ice cloud form. You see formation of ice at  0 C near the surface because there are a lot of surfaces that lower the energy barrier for ice nucleation. Thus why it is so wrong to blindly apply Le Chatelier principle, which refers to thermodynamic equilibrium of chemical reactions, to the whole climate system. When was the last time you saw something in equilibrium (immovable, unchanging) in this planet? Aren't the earth sciences fun?	17
0	I see the pot's calling the kettle black as well.	17
0	No need to get agresive, I just want to understand what his point was.	17
0	Except for two (not minor) problems with your thesis:  1) The oceans *are still heating up*. In fact, they are storing many times as much energy as the atmosphere is. They aren't releasing heat, they are still adsorbing it.  2) Solar activity has been declining for *fifty years* at this point	17
0	&gt; Would you believe it was eight years ago today that the United Nations predicted we only had “as little as eight years left to avoid a dangerous global average rise of 2C or more.” This failed prediction, however...  How is this a failed prediction? It's looking likely that the temperature anomaly will reach +2°C this century, and this is largely due to the lack of serious carbon emission curtailment over the last 8 years.  The article reads as though it was predicted that there would be 2°C of warming by 2015, which would be a ridiculous mischaracterisation.	17
0	I'm not surprised you have never heard of that saying before.	17
0	&gt; Even IF the planet warmed 2C by 2050, by then the technological singularity very likely will have happened  Technological singularity by 2050? You don't know what you're talking about.	17
0	Lose what? Lol I can see you like to act like a child (not surprising)	17
0	It's spelt dude. You lose again.	17
0	So these scientists from 40 years ago and current climatologists are the same people..?	17
0	This just seems like people looking for evidence to support their viewpoint. A theory from a small minority of scientists 40 years ago when climate science was relatively undeveloped being used to dismiss a widely held and tested theory today?	17
0	That human-released green house gases cause a rise in global temperature. Of course models aren't 100% right, that's impossible. Why have many different models? Because there are many different approaches to modeling the Earth's climate, and taking the approximation of many is a way of triangulating to increase accuracy.   Where is the denier's model? Where are their papers? I read the literature- why aren't they participating in the scientific dialogue? I don't mean blogs, I mean peer-reviewed publications.	17
0	There are approximately 100 papers there. Out of the thousands of papers on the other side of the equation, my point stands.   No, they aren't. People posting on blogs and places like this subreddit isn't the scientific dialogue. I've read over 200 peer reviewed articles over the past 8 months, and many dealt with this topic, how many have you read?   So, down vote me so I can't post, and call me a liar again. Is that debate to you?	17
0	So you're not addressing my point? Also, climate science is a hard science, what makes you think it isn't?	17
0	You just gave up when the only challenge at hand was reading a rather simple article correctly.   Implausible accusations?  What?    Checkmate!	17
0	Do you live under a rock?	17
0	Are you just being ignorant again Florence?	17
0	Where did he say he could see into the future?  Are you saying that if 2015 is the hottest year on record, you will believe that the Whitehouse told NASA and NOAA to make it the hottest year?	17
0	&gt;Stop downvoting stuff you don't agree with and the same will magically happen to you.  If any person has any sort of differing idea, or makes a correction to you guys, or even asks a question as Benthinksit did, this sub automatically downvotes them. Weird huh?	17
0	You dont even need warming. Humans are killing species left and right!	17
0	Destroying an entire planet is usually reserved for villains in scifi movies.  I hope all you climate deniers feel guilty for what you've done.	17
0	It's cute when you guys play with your little court jester.	17
0	So because animals have gone extinct in the past without the help of humans, means humans won't have an effect on animals going extinct in the present/future?	17
0	&gt;Since some guy on a video says it, it must be true!	17
0	Being religious, that's offensive because that will actually happen at some time. So, technically, they're *a lot worse* than the hucksters on TV telling us they know when Jesus will return because they're guessing when something will happen that will never happen versus something that will but the knowledge to which we are not privy.	17
0	&gt;  but to say humans are the only cause is to say nothing.  No one said humans were the only cause. But in many instances humans are the main cause, or play some part in the reduction of population numbers of species.  &gt;You can not punish the entire human race.  Please refrain from hyperbole, as no one is punishing the entire human race.  &gt;Sorry, not everybody cares.  Everyone should be aware at least, you shouldn't be ignorant of your surroundings.	17
0	Ok then, please attempt making a point - any point whatsoever - about the article you posted.    Until you do that everyone that reads this will continue making the assumption (probably correctly) that you interpreted the article incorrectly.   It's your stage - say something!!	17
0	This is anecdotal evidence, and is equivalent to someone pointing out a hot summer and saying it's because of global warming.	17
0	Yes I agree. It's frustrating to see both sides of the debate do it because it's more like ammunition than evidence.	17
0	99%. Now Florence, are you trying to say that because of this, humans should not worry about driving other species to extinction?	17
0	Care to answer any of my questions Ms. illogical?	17
0	So it's obvious that the arctic ice is reducing at a relatively quick rate is this not something to be concerned about?	17
0	thats very surprising, coming from the American Energy Alliance  &gt;It was founded in 2008 by Thomas Pyle, who previously lobbied on behalf of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association and Koch Industries	17
0	LOL...  maybe in loony land.	17
0	Please dont flame, I'm sincerely curious. I stumbled across this sub and in reading your post, a question came to mind.   What is political about global warming?	17
0	Oh no! How will the people of San Antonio ever survive?? Creating a new route is too much of an inconvenience, they a l might as well move to a different cities now.	17
0	You're being silly. It's an endangered spider, reroute the highway. You're making it sound like it will be a catastrophe if the highway isn't being built in that location.	17
0	/u/jimrosenz  what do you think?	17
0	well you completely ignore the salient point that this 'research' is paid for by the very industry who benefit from the precise findings, is that not a bit iffy?	17
0	im still waiting for your responses /u/florinator, /u/ozric101	17
0	Wait, do you actually think fossil fuels don't cause any harm to the environment?	17
0	&gt;LOL, it's "allowed to flow" from a man-made reservoir!  Of course it's allowed to flow, that's how dams on rivers work...  &gt; You should also check out water treatment plants, they are amazing pieces of engineering, they actually filter and clean the sewage! Crazy Star Trek stuff, I know!    And where do these water treatment plants put the treated sewage, Captain Oblivious?	17
0	&gt; &gt; one that has brought us to the precipice of environmental destruction  &gt; Do you really expect to be taken serious with that kind of statement?  Did you or did you not say this? If you did then I responded to the correct post.	17
0	Hey, you are known for your far out assumptions about what people say. I figured I try it out.	17
0	or our increasing use of fertilizers (which are much better at growing hardier and more productive plants than just increasing CO2), and advancing farming practices.	17
0	The article states that there is FAR more money behind global warming proponents than skeptics with no numbers to compare or sources. This is just an editorial opinion. Read it as such.	17
0	I am not making an arguement. I'm saying the article doesn't properly support its claims so it's not rearly worthwhile reading.	17
0	Gmt = global mean temperature?  If so, there are many variables which affect this over selected time frames such as solar intensity, volcanoes, ocean currents, radiation, etc.  While i am very skeptical with respect to climate change modeling, it is an undeniable fact that co2 results in atmospheric warming.  my understanding is that about 1/3 of the modeled warming can be attributed to co2 and the rest is based on assumptions of positive forcings which i believe to be highly suspect.	17
0	You are why we climate skeptics get called deniers...	17
0	That's how voting works. Unless you *win* you lose.	17
0	I don't know, how many grants? You don't know either. My only point is that the article makes unsupported claims and isn't going to help either of us become more knowledgeable on this topic. Do you normally 'hear' of who gets awarded huge climate related research grants? I'd bet you don't have a clue. FYI AGW deniers do get research grants (eg Willie Soon, Richard Lindzen ect). I agree probably not as much from the public agencies you mentioned for a variety of reasons, some valid and some probably not. I don't know. Again, the OP's article isn't going to help us here.	17
0	UKIP voters got what they deserved.  If they had had the foresight to relocate, and all live in one geographic area, then they would have got more seats (as the SNP voters did - they got 50+ seats with less votes than UKIP).  Of course, being idiotic rightwingers, the UKIP voters did not think ahead, and spread themselves all over the country, resulting in many wasted votes.	17
0	Based on what.. why are you suspicious of the UN?	17
0	No not all fertilizers are made from fossil fuels (only nitrogen fertilizers are. P, K, S, CA etc are not). But I was not talking about fossil fuels to begin with anyways, just that pumping large quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere is not that effective as a fertilizer as compared to other fertilizers.	17
0	Wind Turbines actually kill birds at a similar rate to any other building or structure; there's nothing special about wind turbines that cause them to kill birds. Estimates of deaths per year ranges from as low as 40,000 to 500,000. For arguments sake, let's suppose they kill a million birds.  That's 1/70 of bird deaths by automobile That's 1/500 of bird deaths by windows That's 1/152 of bird deaths by power lines Let alone bird deaths due to domestic cats and other predators  A little context goes a long way.	17
0	Not necessarily. For example, birds will travel in a north south direction along the foothills of the rocky mountains, but as we all know, the predominant direction of the wind I'm the foothills of the rocky Mountains is from the west	17
0	You should look at the minimum extend in september and you see a difference!	17
0	Seeing as Denver just had its [4th warmest start on record]( http://www.thedenverchannel.com/weather/weather-blogs/2015-currently-4th-warmest-in-colorado-history) , not sure what you're trying to insinuate.   I live in Denver and mowed my lawn Saturday.  I shoveled my deck today.  By Friday I'll have all my flowers planted.	17
0	Sorry. Not too familiar with logical fallacies. Could you tell me how that is not an example of an argument from ignorance? Or am I not understanding your point? Or is this an example of an ad hominem attack?	17
0	Statistically speaking, [this paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096314000163) gives a somewhat interesting statistical assessment of recent temperatures. [This paper](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/pd/climate/factsheets/canwarming.pdf) addresses your question more directly. The amount of change is significant, and the rate of change is even more important.  Not sure about your second point... it isn't a theory because there's abundant evidence to show that it has already happened, but theory is used in attempts to understand it, by both sides. In other words, scientists develop and use theory to interpret evidence and make projections about future change or lack thereof.	17
0	Zinger. Thanks for clearing that up. I've been defaulting to an informal fallacy by suggesting that an editorial lacks informative content. /s  Obviously I committed an even worse logical fault by continuing this exchange. Cheers.	17
0	NO, we can't. But the difference during april is minimal. (-2.6%/decade). The difference however is huge during the month september.  The albedo difference is huge in september 2014 compared to 1995.   Look at the following page: http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/  Figure 1. The anomaly between 1995 and now is nearly 4000 km³	17
0	The arcticle is about the sea ice minimum (september-october); yet the author of the website compares the results of 5 may.	17
0	But was it a brutally cold winter for Denver though?	17
0	This ignores quite a bit, especially any consideration of a globe destroyed by fossil fuels. What the author also fails to consider is the massive externalities inherent in fossil fuels. There is a reason these projects are opposed by people who live in the places the projects are pursued: fossil fuel extraction, refinement, and combustion is toxic and destructive. Most of the time foreign labor (nearly slavery) is brought in to work the projects, leaving locals even more at a loss. If the West wants the best for the poor, they should stop colonizing them for their fossil fuel resources and start investing aggressively in renewable energy projects and civil society to combat corruption.	17
0	That blog post is pure horse shit. Why bother posting such crap? He takes one date talked about in that BBC article then compares it to a completely different date. What a lying misleading cunt. Judging by the blog post's comments section such dishonesty is working. Just horrible.	17
0	&gt;So, where did all this ecobabble come from? Well, as I recall the first ecoword was “ecology”, which from the Greek root words means “the study of annoying stuff”.  Anyone who takes this man serious, even for a single second, is an absolute moron.	17
0	I hope you're not laughing at the dead Northerners.  That could also make skeptics look bad.    Sandy was the largest Atlantic Hurricane ever in total diameter, spanning over 1100 miles.  If damage and size and flooding and deaths and destruction and cost in dollars and total precipitation are not factors in your hurricane scale, then your hurricane scale sucks, even if it's the "consensus" scale used by scientists.  Hmm, "consensus" science, where have we heard that term before?    Edit:  Storm surge too.  And perhaps "towns cut off from civilization except by air and national guard".  Sandy had records for all those in NY state.	17
0	I'm aware that this computer is powered by FF, and I would like to change that here and everywhere, and I think rich northern nations could afford to make that the development priority. They don't because they're captured by the FF industry. We don't need them for electricity anymore. New capacity doesn't need to be centralized FF generation controlled by corrupt bureaucrats. It's a matter of cost, and it's northern elites that are keeping their hoarded capital from deploying out of greed and then blaming people who are rightly concerned with ecosystem collapses and the real, ongoing, documented, toxic, and destructive effects of FF development.	17
0	&gt; Um, actually we're at a record high snowpack  Not according to [this](http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/ftpref/data/water/wcs/basinsweplots/co/basinplotstate15.gif?). This low snowpack might be the reason the reservoirs are higher than average (higher than average temperatures could increase snowpack melt thus increasing the volume of the reservoirs).  Also your 85% reservoir volume is overly optimistic, because you are forgetting about the longer lag time for snow to melt and make its way through the water shed. Also, you can see from the chart I have given you, there was not a large quantity of water added to the overall snowpack from this storm.	17
0	&gt; The amount of sea ice in the Arctic is essentially identical to 20 years ago.  There are 7 300 days between 1995 and 2015. He chose two of those and then makes that claim. You can't say much with such limited data. If he cared to look at more data he wouldn't say such foolish things.	17

0	Calling coal and oil clean is quite the stretch, don't you think?	17
0	Just not the ones that eat fish. Can they do that with the Wind Ultrasonic Technology (WUT), I think they can. I believe they can. I see a new fast food franciese in the making.	17

0	Ice melts on antarctic shelf and refreeze in the sea.	17
0	Hi I usually come out against climate deniers. But this article is from Counter Punch, which is an excellent mag. And it criticizes PoMo which is also good. Climate change reality is really really bad, but Counterpunch is really good.	17
0	&gt; Even Lewandowsky's own side  No, this guy is disputing the consensus of 97% of scientists.  Denier!	17
0	Huh our winter had record high temperatures with little to no snowfall in the mountains which shut down the ski resort in February.	17
0	You guys are clearly retarded.	17
0	Calm down there ozzy. I was replying the guy saying his winter was cold and snowy. Did you also give him the same speech?	17
0	Oh really? because I don't see you giving him that speech. Did you forget, or are you working on it?	17
0	The mountains and skiing are almost always better in the Rockies and west. This year was most likely just an anomaly.	17
0	I'm jealous, looks like you had more snow than my resort did. Which is weird considering I'm canada	17
0	Where did I state this winter was representative of climate? Since when is snow in may an anomaly for most ski resorts in california?	17
0	Who said I was in california? And again, since when is snow in may an anomaly for most California ski resorts?	17
0	Anthony:  I was born and raised in Fresno County in 1950s- early 1970s where I developed my climate passion (well before global warming issues).  You don’t see winter storm warnings for the Southern Sierras in mid-May too often.  It’s not like they haven’t had enough snow this season.  http://wattsupwiththat.com/2011/05/15/late-low-may-snow-in-california/  Yea, seems like it doesn't do it much down there.  But since you DON"T live in Ca, you wouldn't know that.  I do note it's from 2011, but it's snowing in the same place today.  So the write up still has weight.	17
0	Well to start off I said MOST California ski resorts (Places like Mammoth often get snowstorms in May), and you were giving me articles about lake tahoe ski resorts getting snow (again, not unusual for those places to receive snow in May). Now for bear mountain and the article you posted, they don't usually receive snow this late (although not unheard of) and the reason they had all these events planned so early was because of the warm weather and lack of snow throughout the winter months. They figured they would be safe, and not have to deal with snow.	17
0	Humans have already ruined one planet, why would we want to start ruining more?	17
0	Hello there!   The mods at /r/science seem very confidential and discrete.  As to "doxxing" why not make an account devoted to nothing but peer reviewed science postings? Get that verified, satisfy the requirements of /r/science and askscience when posting, and face no repercussions if someone IDs you?  Why would people treat you badly offline for posting something on reddit that is just a peer reviewed science paper?	17
0	Hello there!  Maybe I just don't know what "doxxing" means? I thought I did, and that isn't compatible with the flair process at /r/science. So maybe there's more than one meaning?	17
0	Also, without phosphorus there is no DNA.	17
0	Because it is a childish taunt. Climate denier may be a ridiculous term, but it doesn't make the speaker sound immature.	17
0	Hello!  Well, that *is* what I thought it meant. But I don't understand how this relates to the /r/science flair process.  You provide the mods with verification support and they keep it confidential and will even delete the email you send as verification.   So how is this self-doxxing? You are under no obligation to be super specific about your field or provide any identifying information publicly.	17
0	Hello!  But doesn't "doxxing" mean that you're publicly being outed?  How is voluntarily, privately telling specific individuals your real life identity, who keep it confidential, doxxing?	17
0	This Pope is a disaster.	17
0	Technically Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen only make up 92ish% of the human body. Also the forms that Carbon, and Oxygen are not primarily in the form of CO2 I the body. Now the body is 57% water but that does not really contribute to the addition of hydrogen or oxygen to the body, as the body doesn't usually break apart the water molecules.	17

0	&gt; think the Nile stopped flooding annually for a while around then. Could be related.  It possibly could be related, but the Persian Gulf does not play a role on the whether or not the Nile floods or not and high sea levels will not directly stop a river from flooding annually (unless there is am earthquake near the mouth of the river which reverses the flow of the river)	17

0	Sorry I was thinking Mammoth mountain getting a storm in 2011. Although [Big bear lake](http://www.currentresults.com/Weather/California/Places/big-bear-lake-snowfall-totals-snowstorm-averages.php) does receive snow in May some years.	17
0	No... it doesn't. There's no killings of denialists.	17

0	another consequence that has been predicted since at least the early 90s.	17
0	the global warming is not pausing. this will, in all likelihood, be the hottest year BY FAR.	17
0	the best analogy is that climate change acts to load the dice to favor extreme outcomes for weather.	17
0	The level of dumb in this thread is, statistically speaking, over 9000!	17
0	....yet every single post and comment you have is about climate change, and denial of it.  LMAO. gg astroturf  ill be visiting here from now on early and often!	17
0	no. this year is supposed to be a monster el nino, just like 1998.  which is why the claim that it hasn't warmed can even be attempted.   but lets make a bet if you feel so strongly. 100 dollars ok?	17
0	that only counts if you:  1) only give a shit about USA 2) don't consider Sandy a hurricane, despite only being outdone by Katrina in terms of cost of dmg  I agree that the Atlantic Basin has been quiet, and hurricane genesis involves a few factors. its unclear about what the effects of windshear might be, but about the limit of where predictions can be made is that the potential for more intense storms exists by virtue of increased water temperatures.  there have been 5 cat 5's in the pacific in 2015 already.	17
0	the cause of Bostons extreme cold weather was caused by a persistent ridge near Alaska. high amplitude event. this happened through most of winter-- hence why cali is dry and hot and Boston got hit as bad as they did.  speaking of Alaska, that ridge is still there. its 40 degrees above normal all this week in Alaska above the arctic circle. all of the snow has melted way ahead of schedule, and its about to be 24 hour sunlight there.  can't have it both ways you fucking dipshit.	17
0	Funny that whole fiasco was found to be bullshit. Keep using it though please.	17
0	none of those things matter though, and they are all set up by one degree or another, arctic amplification. that's the point-- zonal flow was almost non existent this winter. that could be the new norm.  and the point is, this week, its about to get real north of Alaska. if you don't appreciate that ice reflects most of the suns rays that hit it back to space, and oh by the way, its 40 fucking degrees above normal on the shore of the arctic ocean and they are about to have 24 hours of sunlight for 2 months, then you are too incompetent for this conversation.	17
0	Antarctica is gaining ice because the glaciers are flowing into the sea, and the freshwater sits on top of the salt water and it freezes easier...  but the ice melts all the same every year. there are only significant differences as the ice gets close to to March minimum. Antarctica is not at risk of melting out anytime soon....  but the arctic is a litttttle different. most of the sea ice there is 1.5-2 meters thick.	17
0	More crop supporting reigons would be all well and good, but negitive effects will likely outweigh the benefits.   Some already warm crop supporting reigons will become less arable with the warming climate, changing rainfall patterns will leave some croplands dry (but *could* create good growing conditions in new locations.) and more frequent extreme weather events, as well as more common pests and pathogens will cut into crop yeild.	17
0	On the other hand there are alertst 5 category 5 typhoons this year in the pacific ocean. But as long as it doesn't influence the US skeptics dont care.	17
0	I'm sorry, but I'm not Al Gore.	17
0	Plenty of species have died out in the past due to natural causes, but currently all of the endangered species im aware of are threatened by the activities of man.   And natural means exactly that, not caused by man.  Unnatural: anything we have an influence on.  Natural: anything that exists as it is without our interference.  If we were included in the latter, there would be no distinction for the word "natural" to make and it would never have come into existance.	17
0	I feel they are better to watch than NASCAR and Fox News.   You seem to agree that the planet is getting crowded. I really feel you would enjoy this documentary.

0	I don't hate people at all. Im just weary of a 7.3 billion herd of us. The population was half that in the good ole days that you so foundly remember. There are physical limits to the planet you know.....	17

0	I was viewing the top posts of the sub. You seemed to be one the few responses that genuinely seemed interested in both sides.	17
0	Au contraire:  &gt; "Under the Medea program to examine the implications of climate change, CIA participated in various projects," a CIA spokesperson explained in a statement. "These projects have been completed and CIA will employ these research results and engage external experts as it continues to evaluate the national security implications of climate change."  That's the source linked to in the article quoted above. If you're a skeptic, stop believing everything that supports what you already believe and dig just a little deeper. Skeptics should confirm that they're not being lied to.  Am _I_ lying? Follow those links and see.	17

0	I love how the members of this group can be reliably counted on to lose their ability to comprehend simple english if understanding it would require having to abandon their strawman version of what was actually predicted.	17
0	Obama can'T go to war with Syria because it's allied with Russia. So they hope Isis will kill Asad. When Isis captures Syria, the coalition led by the US will invade.	17
0	So if you click on the first NASA graph in the article you will notice its basically flat lined. If you actually go to the next graph in the set it reveals why the writer didnt include the second graph from the original website.  http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/IMAGES/seaice.anomaly.arctic.png  The writer, James Taylor should be ashamed for cherry picking data to support his political worldview. He went off on a tangent based on a false premise and you guys eat it up. Good luck in your studies at this rate.	17
0	So the paper doesn't actually present any evidence to support the existence of the Iris effect. It simply states that if you factor in a negative feedback of about 1 degree (the Iris effect), the models are closer to satellite temperature readings. This is disjoint from the surface temperature record and ocean temperature increases.   Edit: to be clear, this isn't an attack on Curry's blog or the paper. I'm simply pointing out that Nature paper isn't about presenting observed evidence for the Iris effect.	17
0	Okay, but that doesn't address my statement, at all: this paper doesn't present any observational evidence that the Iris effect is a real thing.	17
0	I'm sorry but you are just all over the place.  and saying that "every human breaths out co2" tells me you don't understand the carbon life cycle and how it works (http://www.nar.ucar.edu/2008/NCAR/highlights/energizing/carboncycle_full.jpg)  and no not every car pollutes (http://www.edmunds.com/fuel-economy/hondas-pollution-free-car.html) and not every product we use depends on oil (http://myplasticfreelife.com/product-suppliers/).   Maybe in your life, in your world it does but that is the point I am trying to make. Open your eyes to the possibilities.	17
0	I don't think you understand the paragraph I gave, or the actual paper itself. Please show where in the paper they present new experiments to validate the iris effect.	17
0	One step at a time my friend. First electric cars then solar and wind generation. just because you don't have one does not mean you cant start the other.   Please don't think that I am so naive to believe that the electric car I drive does not still indirectly burn fossil fuels. But, it is true that it does not do it directly and the amount that it does take to power it is burnt much more efficiently.   same principle apples to the products we use. We can find ways to greatly, greatly reduce our dependance on petroleum based products then work on changing the ways in which the products are made	17
0	oh wow, you're right. we don't currently have a car that is 100% from start to finish completely oil free. I guess for that reason alone I should just give up on everything I believe about trying to make this planet better and cleaner for life to live on. you win. I should take up smoking.  or maybe ...  That just means we have lots of room for progress and plenty of space for bright and inventive people to work on a very broad area of discovery and development.	17
0	Yes, Much less than other forms of power generation, including Nuclear.  Yet at the same time I have very few concerns and worries about Nuclear power generation.  http://www.energyandpolicy.org/wind_energy_key_wedge_vs_global_warming  These could be a good idea, safety first is all: http://www.npr.org/2013/02/04/170482802/are-mini-reactors-the-future-of-nuclear-power	17
0	Right.  So your argument is basically a Straw Man. Point to the few people who exaggerated the data or used hyperbole for some self-interested motive or the "dire projections" that may have guessed wrong on the timeline and then declare that all of the science is bad.  You're basically dismissing an entire corner of the legitimate scientific community because a few marginal scientists got the timeline wrong.  Dumb.	17

0	if you take it as a "no" then you, once again, missed the point. But if you need to think that you set the internet right and won another victory so that you can sleep at night feeling good about your poor choices, then by all means do so. For I am just tiered of hold your hand to walk you through every little point with out you stepping up to the plate and being willing to reconsider your own views.	17
0	Wait what?  You've linked to the blog of a science writer as the source saying that only .3% of climate scientists believe it's very likely that climate change is happening and humans have caused it.   I linked to the NASA site which says this:  &gt;"Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities, and most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position."  And then here is the link showing the major science organizations that believe climate change is (1) happening and (2) manmade.  http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/	17
0	I perused the link you shared.  Yes, I see that a few of the nearly 12,000 scientists say that their work has been misclassified.  In most cases, the authors say that their work doesn't support the anthropomorphic global warming theory that 90% to 100% of climate change is caused by humans.  But some of these authors have either support the argument that humans have contributed to climate change.  So yes, this is a partial dispute of that article.  This "dispute" does not mean that the basic conclusions of the article are wrong.	17
0	But this is the problem: you do need to do a lot more than just read some simple numbers of raw data stream.   Again, I understand that you think that this is sufficient to understand the data.  But I guarantee you that even a climate scientist who questions the data would tell you that you can't understand the data.  Anyway, I'm not sure why you say that the CO2 levels on earth or the earth's temperatures would support your arguments anyway.  The warmest years in recorded history are all from the last 20 years.  CO2 levels are higher than they've been in recorded history.  Which numbers are you looking at?	17
0	Environmentalism is based on scientific evidence. Religion isn't.  Your definition of religion is incomplete because it says nothing about whether religion is based on science.	17
0	You guys here at /r/climateskeptics have got more of a cult/religion that the massive numbers of people who simply accept the science of climate change.  But just keep telling yourself that you're right and the vast majority of people are wrong.  Have fun with that.  Let me know 30 years from now how that went for you.	17
0	Could you please explain how your intractable position on climate skepticism is any different at all?	17
0	&gt;If you were a smart person, you'd already know the answer.  Right.  Once again the hilarious argument from a climate denier that they're right and super smart and the vast majority of the world is wrong and stupid.	17
0	Well, did you read what they said? Because I did.  And oh by the way, this is like 4 authors out of 12,000 articles.  But sure, keep telling me how they've refuted all of the climate science.	17
0	Fair enough, but in this context my point is about fairness.  Basically, if people here are going to disparage the basic position which accepts the prevailing scientific evidence on climate change as being cultlike/religious -- it feels like a logical response to point out that the same exact thing could be said about a climate skeptic.  So we can agree that neither my position nor your position are both tantamount to being "religious" or cult-like or else we can agree that we're both cult-like.  There's literally nothing that's more cultlike about climate change acceptance compared to climate change skepticism.	17
0	&gt; By all means invoke the moral equivalence fallacy  It's not a fallacy if it is true	17
0	It's one thing to actually be skeptical about something like climate change and to what degree humans can/have effected it (which is good), but it is another thing to refuse to believe humans have no impact on the environment because of an opinion piece someones read (which is what some people have done).	17
0	The NCA page that Goddard/Heller links to actually show changes in heavy precipitation going back to 1901 as well. For some reason he only shows the image that confirms his pre-held belief. Wonder if there's a term for this practice...	17
0	Really? Because that's not how it is in alberta.	17
0	Then why did you group all of canada together, if it's incorrect?	17
0	I'm glad you picked up on the irony of them calling you an alarmist and then them saying the world will end if we try and move away from fossils.	17
0	That's odd because of all the years I've spent going through school at a public, same with siblings (one is just graduating) have never felt there was a great evironmentalist being forced on us.   And you do realize it's because of the PC not diversifying our economy from oil (not saying we shouldn't completely stop production of the oilsands/fracking) that Alberta lost so many jobs from falling oil prices? The oil companies have even said they'd are willing to talk with notley about the taxes on the companies. So no the NDP taking control of the province is not the end of the end of the world as many wild rosers proclaim	17
0	Too lazy to check your posting history?  Oh my god this is possibly the most hilarious thing anybody has ever said to me on Reddit.  Sure, I'll research the posting history of every person who ever responds to one of my posts.  In fact, I have a team of thousands of researchers here with me whose job it is to try to persuade Redditors about climate change.	17
0	Very brave of Monckton to venture out after the [horrifying death threat](http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/05/19/im-dead-send-flowers/) he received last week.	17
0	Well since not all of canada is like that you should have specified the area better.	17
0	Or you could say they noticed it more because saying humans effect the environment goes against their beliefs	17
0	When you lay the evidence out it's tough to argue with it.	17
0	5+ years but I help out one of the teachers often with a program for advance placement students.	17
0	Or only you and your far right friends hace noticed it because you hate all ideas that stray away from yours.  No, not all those people would still be working there because there would other options for employment aside from the oil and gas industry.  Really if the PCs didn't continually drop the taxes on the oil companies (THAT was a stupid idea), the NDP wouldn't have to worry about the awful financial situation the PCs left us in.	17
0	They just passed a bill in Alberta that says if students want a gay straight alliance club the school has to allow it. Which is fair.	17

0	Americans are very poorly educated on science compared to our European counter parts. Look at the laughable statistics on acceptance of the fact of evolution in this country for instance. The climate "debate" is the same case. Our country is losing our post WWII science prestige.	17
0	The way they use that carbon is not only very inefficient but also directly hazardous to those peoples health. The majority of poor countries use very basic carbon fuels for cooking. This dirty fuel burned in a confined area has severe health effects. These health costs are not included in the price of using that carbon fuel.  Your last argument boils down to spend our carbon credit now but leave the clean up bill to your children and grandchildren.	17

0	It doesn't matter where it came from originally.  The oil lobby influences legislation.  They tell politicians that they want to push for some things to happen and for some things to not happen.  And they had power to influence legislators to craft legislation favorable to ethanol development.  All the better that the oil lobby can say that they worked with farmers to help them.  It seemed like a great thing.  But it just helped to reinforce their stranglehold on the energy industry while not actually being a great idea.	17

0	do you think this subreddit should be renamed climate denialists?	17
0	The US spends a fraction of what they spend on feeding the hungry to subsidize clean energy. To say that fraction is a waste is pretty shortsighted. Most of that spending is more than paid back in the economy because it nurtures a new industry which creates new jobs, new technology, and less pollution. The benefits remain whether or not climate change is real.	17

0	The reality is that almost all our President's views and policies neatly synch-up with a majority (and usually a large majority) of American voters. This is why Bill Clinton is still one of America's most popular presidents and will remain so long after he passes from the scene. The same will be true of our current President... why this is a mystery to some is a sad comment only on their own bubble reality, nothing more. When in doubt, in a democracy a leader should follow the will of the people. When the history of this period is written it will be will quite kind to our president.	17
0	This subreddit is all about motivated thinking, that is:  Fix the facts around your pre-existing prejudices (pretty much the very definition of "bubble reality"...).  There is very little thoughtful and respectful discussion here, but there sure is an awful lot of uninformed venting.  Too bad, as the authentic skeptic POV is very interesting and worthy of thought and discussion, but most of what you see here is here say, gossip and rumor salted with a healthy dose of tribal thinking.	17

1	I hate the fact that I used to like him and think he was a smart man.	20
1	And the "worst analogy of the year" award goes to...	20
1	&gt;Capitalism is NOT perfect.  Socialism is NOT perfect.   That's fine, as long as we keep in mind that socialism is a lot more "not perfect" than capitalism.  I think most folks advocating a best of both worlds approach tend to forget that.	20
1	Nevermind that Capitalism has provided more than Socialism ever has in terms of quality of life, and abundance.   The only difference is Capitalism requires you work, and in some cases work harder than others to get more. I'd rather have it that way than receive what everyone else gets regardless of how much I output, and how hard I work; As well as have what I've worked for confiscated from me forcefully and given to those who don't work as hard.	20
1	Liberals seem to hate pizza lately. They just tried to set a shop owner on fire in Baltimore.	20

1	He's really good at pretending to know what he's talking about.	20
1	In my defence that was when I was in High School. And luckily before I could legally vote.	20
1	Brilliantly stated. Completely agree. This is what is perpetuating our gridlock and essentially useless congress.	20
1	Look at Germany, Netherlands, and many others in the EU - they are doing VERY WELL. Great schools, Universities, amenities, and healthcare is a basic RIGHT for their citizens. Above this they are able to still compete competitively in the capitalistic world we live in. There are certain facets that benefit more from one ideology versus another, but we need to put our pride and biases aside for long enough to have that discussion.	20
1	I laughed. I am sure some panties will be in a twist for that comment.	20
1	&gt; That being said, ESOPs and credit unions are both good examples of small-scale socialism that work well. Trade unionism and cooperatives are fine within a market economy. I have no problem with this kind of socialism.   Credit unions and coops aren't socialist or anti-Capitalist.  No more than going to a church and tithing is "socialist".  "Working together" isn't socialism. It's when it's forced - either by law or by lack of choice - that it ceases to be capitalism.	20
1	Disarm police because "liberals" have developed a habit of chronic lying about police shootings?  I don't think so.  Yawn.  Get back to me when there's an unpunished rash of police shootings of people who didn't fucking deserve it.	20
1	Michael Moore says "Disarm Police" while protected by his own armed bodyguards.	20
1	Every single European nation counts on us for their national defense, which we pick up the tab for pro bono.   If that cost burden was on them, they wouldn't be able to provide any of the services you mentioned that are "basic rights" for everyone.   Also if you consider the taxation that the EU is forcing on the richer member nations, I'd hardly look at that as doing well.	20
1	Exactly this.  If you want socialism beyond defense and roads then by all means get together with a group of similar"minded" people and enjoy your commune.  Just leave me out of it.   They'll never entertain that idea as it fails without capitalist daddy to pay the bills.	20
1	&gt;Police brutality is a real issue, and shouldn't be seen as a liberal or conservative one either.  The problem, though, is that people are trying to portray police brutality as a national problem with the institution despite the fact that it is statistically rare.	20
1	Pretty much. Rush embellishes and trolls, but I appreciate his ability to cause liberal butthurt.	20
1	&gt; We Are Willing to Kill  Way to prolong the stereotype.	20
1	Sometimes I visualize him at home over his grill.  He takes tiny liberal brains, skewers them on kebabs, then slowly turns them over the fire while  enjoying a fine cigar.	20
1	Look at how many black children were spared a life of drug addiction now that this dealer is gone.   # BLACK LIVES MATTER	20
1	Because being scared by the word "socialism" is silly.  It's perfectly fine to disagree with socialism and Bernie Sanders, but I think actually looking at a person's policies and previous action in office will give you a much better idea of the man than what word a headline wishes to emphasize.	20
1	how are you a lefty motherfucker if you can't stand tax skirting and privileged billionaire elites?  Those are literally a staple of the left.	20
1	Capitalism with many social improvements has worked wonders in northern Europe.	20
1	You literally just paraphrased Marx.  Are you aware of that? Does anyone here understand that socialism was created by someone that predicted market reactions to capitalism?	20
1	What do you mean by this headline? He doesn't need our permission to run for president...  And honestly, conservatives should welcome Bernie to the race. He'll pull Hillary left. And if he's as "real" as the media plays him up to be, maybe he'll get some shots in at Hillary for being a part of the establishment.	20
1	I would like to see one of these articles with actual numbers in it.  Was this business really profitable before the wage increase, or was it already struggling?  What were the annual sales and gross profits?  What percentage of overhead was employee payroll?	20
1	Understandable.  Eighteen-year-olds have never lived in a world where any significant warming occurred.   [Edit: By "significant" I mean statistically significant, as in when we can say with mathematical confidence that *some* warming has happened.]	20
1	&gt; Eighteen-year-olds have never lived in a world where any significant warming occurred.  That combined with the fact every damn thing the cults profits of gloom and doom promised was going to happen has proven to be a bunch of bullshit.	20

1	Sadly this is what happens when your understanding of economics is derived solely from reading comic books.	20
1	See, the protester was black and the mom was forcing him to do something he wants so it is racist even though she is his mom and also black.  She just has internalized racism that the white patriarchy has drilled in to her over the years.  /s	20
1	Comic books are sadly more accurate than most statist beliefs	20
1	&gt;ozone lair  Well I'm glad the ozone still has a place to sleep.	20
1	I'm a pretty big comic nerd. I run a comic convention in Houston that is coming up in May.  A lot of people are very liberal and wish for a higher minimum wage. Now, I get to show them it affects them in a negative way.	20
1	Anything that gets in the way of justifying black violence is now racist.	20
1	The problem is the fucking city of San Francisco, not the employers there. They don't allow new buildings, have ridiculous regulations and massive sales taxes. Businesses are flocking out of California, especially large cities like San Fran. If you think that they will be ecstatic to create a business in a city with a $15 MW then I don't know what to tell you.	20
1	So young people are having a time believing that a planet is 4,600,000,000 years old and our 119 years of data does provide enough Info?	20

1	And on Chicago's local news stations...crickets.	20
1	&gt; I never understood the desire of the left for a higher minimum wage.  Because their overwhelming desire to help the poor and downtrodden, however well intentioned, blinds them from the collateral effects and long term consequences.	20
1	If you're not trolling, the exact same behavior applies to countries. It's not a state specific thing, it's an economic pressure results in rational behavior thing.	20

1	I tend to agree on this issue just because, as a taxpayer, i dont feel i should have to subsidize a companies employees through welfare because the company doesn't pay enough. If they can't or won't pay your employees a living wage, perhaps the business plan is the real issue	20
1	They did the exact same play for King Nothing. I really hope people don't fall for this BS three times in a row!	20
1	I tend to lean more to the personal responsibility issue. What responsibility does a society have, toward an able-bodied reasoning adult, to ensure they have a "living wage"?  If you are making minimum wage as a 20 year old, that's probably fine; you are working your way up. If you are making minimum wage as a 40 year old with a family, my tendency is to ask what the hell happened.	20
1	"An entire massive chunk of politicians' economic policy is based on making stupid people feel better."  And you've discovered the entire progressive belief system.  Watch cnn or msnbc with this phrase in the back of your mind.  First you'll laugh and then you'll cry.	20
1	&gt; If you are making minimum wage as a 40 year old with a family, my tendency is to ask what the hell happened.  I agree with that. The 30 and 40 year told that I know that are around minimum wage (and I can only think of two of them) are there because they do things like mouth off to their bosses, skip work without calling in, refuse to learn new skills, or just flat-out quit a job because there's something cool they want to do one weekend.	20
1	Wait it closed!? I was just there last month. Fuck! That's my comic book store.	20
1	If politicians had a comic-book-level ability to reason we'd be far better off.	20
1	But if you ask them what happened, they'll tell you their boss was a dick. For the last five jobs they've had.	20
1	Or statistics reg how many pizza shops opened in the neighborhood as well recently. Or how well other pizza shops are doing, if at all. Or closing rate of pizza shops historically. Not supporting or trashing the min wage hike, just that one needs to dig deeper before coming to conclusions.	20
1	Exactly. There's always an excuse. At some point you need to say "If everyone around you is an asshole, it's not every around you that's an asshole."	20
1	&gt;“Why,” he asks, “can’t two consenting people make arrangements for less than x dollars per hour?”  This gets me.  When it comes to sex, most everyone in the city says Consent!  When it comes to economics though, private citizens and firms certainly can't be trusted to work out the arrangement that is best for both parties.	20

1	This is an evolution of the pro-abortion reasoning that it's fine to kill unborn children because "they couldn't live by themselves" (outside of the womb). I've seen people argue that "post-birth abortions" until the age of 3-5 are acceptable because of this. After all, the reasoning goes, how many 2- year olds could survive without parents?	20
1	&gt; Bernie Sanders won't even clinch the nomination in the first place.  Which is actually a real tragedy.  He's one of the few liberals who's actually honest about his views, which of course would result in his being crushed in the election.	20
1	clearly the shop owner is a racist 1% looking to make millions off slave labor  /s	20
1	Some thugs wear blue.	20
1	&gt;This is an evolution of the pro-abortion reasoning that it's fine to kill unborn children because "they couldn't live by themselves" (outside of the womb).  I agree. It's also an extension of their mentality of justifying shedding the responsibility of sexual activity leading to procreation. "Here is one more reason why I don't have to take responsibility for my actions".	20
1	I love when knee jerk Libs suggest what the min wage should be. How do they know what a business can afford? Have they seen everyone's books? No.   They act as if employers set wages arbitrarily. It's insanity.   If I have a comic book store, it is possible that my clientele can't afford a price hike.   If I own a four seasons hotel, they probably can.	20
1	Here it comes.  Its no longer simply: "abortion is about individual choice"  It is now: "abortion is good social policy."  Lets see if the democrats embrace and promote abortion as population control, or the way to prevent childhood disabilities.  We all know that is what they believe.	20
1	I truly feel for this guy.  But if I was him I'd throw it right back in their faces.  I'd put a $1 to $2 "minimum wage surcharge" (I have no idea if this is legal) on every item sold.  And then when some progressive moron complained I'd tell him "Elections have consequences.  You wanted everyone to make $15/hour, then you pay for it."	20
1	I have always heard it said like this.  The left defines success as how many people who need help are getting help.  The right defines success as how many people who previously needed help no longer need help.  It's all a matter of your end goal do you want people who are depending on you for what they need or do you want people depending on themselves to get what they need.	20
1	Read this as: "We are rushing to judgment, and even if there's no evidence, we're going to rush this to court because we're out to destroy the police in general."	20
1	For the sake of the high ground, and considering that we've been through this before with Treyvon and Michael Brown, I ask everyone to remember that we're a society that believes in innocent until proven guilty. For that phrase to mean anything, we must stand by it even in the most damming of circumstances.	20
1	While there are no plans to close, the article states that if the store cannot achieve a significant increase in revenue, it will be forced to close.  The owner is attempting to increase revenue through creative means before giving up.	20

1	Liberals hate big businesses influence on government, yet pull shit like this which prices small businesses out of the market.	20
1	i'm actually excited to hear what they have to say and the babble that's going to come out of their mouths when defending the cops.   So you get excited by Conservatives reminding you that just because they are charged with anything does not mean they are guilty ?  You got a prob bud.	20
1	nah, it's just another thread in this subreddit hijacked by the far left.	20
1	Because why involve the government when it's not necessary?	20
1	Does anyone know the racial makeup of the 6 officers charged? News reports consistently report that Freddie Gray was African-American, but no mention is made of the officers' race.	20
1	Fascists just like senseless violence, as is evident here.	20
1	Thats funny,because when I go to /r/news anything that liberals dont want to discuss gets buried...	20
1	They havent been found guilty.	20
1	Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones?	20
1	Anyone that was able to remain objective on the topic would have (and will continue to withhold judgment) until all the facts have been revealed. If you "saw" this coming, it means you speculated about something that you had no idea of knowing, most likely from preconceived prejudices.	20
1	Could I have a run down please of the specific Democratic policies and why they have oppressed the Baltimore population in question?	20
1	This is actually a good question.  Over 50% of the Baltimore PD is black and often times the black cops are just as prejudice as white cops   Edit: 3 of the 6 are black	20
1	Supporting strong nuclear family units, supporting a culture that doesn't kick out children old enough to enter the job market or collect welfare, choosing an area with a lower cost of living, and just plain finding a roommate are ways to survive on what is considered not a "livable" wage. Entry level is ideally meant for entry level, but even in less than ideal situations, it doesn't necessarily fall straight to the social safety net to ensure survival.	20
1	Exactly. Even if Gray, who is undeniably a dirt bag, was doing just that; the cops didn't secure him and he died. The force required to cause the injury to his neck isn't something a man can do shackled up. If the cops had buckled him in, and on top of that not arrested him for no reason (being now that the knife wasn't even a switchblade) he wouldn't be dead. Officer's are accountable for their actions.	20
1	Far too many people have no desire to learn how to fish, and who could blame them when the fish are free for the taking?	20
1	Funny, because it's a comic book store in a very expensive place. I'd be willing to bet that the owner was barely breaking even as it was and the business was a hobby that employed a few people.	20
1	A lot of restaurants are doing exactly that.	20
1	*People shouldn't be allowed to have a different opinion than mine! I need a safe place to go pout about it like a goddamn 3-year-old!*  We have a whole generation of toddlers coming up.	20
1	This is why we conservatives get upset when the government takes one small step and increases its overall reach.	20
1	I think he himself actually doesn't shy away from the term.	20
1	It's such a hot mess. I mean I absolutely despise the criminal element, but officers of the law need to be held to the highest standards. That means taking responsibility of their f-ups. I know how terrible their jobs are, but you can't ignore things like this.	20
1	Well, what you call "sacrificing police officers" I would call holding them responsible for their actions. I just don't understand why freedom-loving Americans would accept government overreach in the form of police acting badly.	20
1	I tried and didn't find anything noteworthy.   Maybe those who hold the belief that Democratic policies have been oppressing Blacks should back up their viewpoints.	20
1	The Christian religion was the intended target from the start.	20
1	We don't know all the facts, but we will eventually.   The officers were charged because that's the way our system works, not to placate a mob.   The rest of it will be up to a judge and jury to decide, not a violent mob, the media, or someone else's opinion.	20
1	I am from the middle of Wisconsin. I know very little about the state of Maryland, let alone the city of Baltimore. I was not pandering, nor was I baiting. While I do not subscribe to the same ideology as this subreddit, I was honestly curious what was the details were. &gt; If you need examples and explanations, then you won't listen even if they are provided in spades.  So if i want answers, i don't actually want answers? Not a huge fan of the hostility.	20
1	Probably not for the servers. In most states, minimum wage for tipped employees like servers and bartenders is $2.13 per hour. A good server or bartender at the right place can make $50-$100 per hour. Do you think they want to trade that for $15 per hour?	20
1	Nothing is wrong with unions, intrinsically. In fact, they are a valuable member of the labor market. The reason conservatives in the US (including me) tend to oppose them is because many labor laws unfairly shift power towards unions, such that many businesses with union workforces are hobbled. Right to work is an incursion on market principles, but we tend to support it because it shifts a power balance back towards parity, rather than strongly favoring labor.	20
1	"Or don't teach a man to fish and feed yourself. He's a grown man, and fishing is not that hard" - Ron Swanson	20
1	How is asking a completely neutral question that you are claiming to know the answer to, "not interested in having a discussion about it"?  "Democratic policies are the root cause of Baltimore's problems!"  "In what way? Which policies?"  "You obviously don't want to know."  What? How are you even feeling ok with responding that way?	20
1	That's not how any of this works.  The feds actually have no authority whatsoever to enforce local laws.  The screaming imbecile doesn't even understand the basics of our system of government, he needs to shut his fool mouth and go home.  &gt; there has to be a national answer to a national crisis  The "national crisis" is that "liberals" are deliberately lying about every case they can to stir up racial tensions.  Most of this "crisis" is based on complete falsehoods.  So black people are being arrested commensurate with their crime rate rather than their population rate.  That's actually correct,  dumbass.	20
1	A national police force?  Maybe they can wear brown color shirts.  What could go wrong?	20
1	&gt;That's how the game is played.  She's overcharging them on purpose, so the jury will come back with "not guilty" on murder.  A perfect situation to deliberately fuel another riot and boost racial tensions for the benefit of the left wing.   If you think they aren't going for convictions, you've been watching too much Sean Hannity.	20
1	It's almost like the United **States** are made up of individual polities that have control of their own internal affairs. But that doesn't matter to Al Sharpton.	20
1	Oh yes because nationalizing the police will fix all our problems. Just like healthcare, and education, and immigration, and everything else. Because the Federal Government is always right.	20
1	One it isn't legal, read the constitution... Second it would move us as a nation towards totalitarianism in a HUGE way... (but then that's what the Left wants) Third once we move towards totalitarianism and the Goverment flexes that muscle to silence disagreement... then we are inevitably headed towards a civil war between the government and its people	20
1	They have to ratchet up the racial tension to keep the Obama Coalition viable. Without the widespread disdain for such 'injustice' nothing would hold this rabble together.  Let them overplay their hand. I think we're already starting to see peak injustice. But I could be wrong.	20
1	Them's what you call "White Blacks."  You're looking at 6 White people.	20
1	Like how Zimmerman was a 'white Hispanic?'	20
1	Precisely.  Also, you see that one person who looks like a woman?  That's a man.  Women cannot hurt men, they can only be victimized by men.  So you're looking at pictures of 6 White men.	20
1	If only some sort of federal law enforcement agency existed that could have its own department that could investigate crime nationwide.	20
1	Bernie Sanders isn't a socialist of that kind. More like a Western European social democrat.	20
1	So it's not possible that different races commit crime at different rates?  Culture isn't a thing?	20
1	So to keep the left happy we are just supposed to ignore their criminal activities ?  Yeah, that sounds like it would work.	20
1	Sorry, I had to stop when you compared raiding sporting goods stores for Jordans with the Boston Tea Party.	20
1	Blacks constitute like 50% of the murderers, whom the victims are majority black, while being 13% of the population. Something is wrong.	20
1	That word is in overuse right now to the point of ridicule (which is good, it shows how meaningless it is). If Hillary or another Democrat woman gets elected they'll switch to 'sexist'.	20
1	Your first example is an accident, not negligence.	20
1	He missed a key part - there is supposed to be a safety line attached to the tool box that the worker did not attach.	20
1	Blacks are arrested more per capita because they commit more crime per capita. Stop blaming whitey and start asking yourself why black culture glorifies a criminal lifestyle.	20
1	I like Clarke but I don't think we know enough about the evidence either way to comment yet. There is a likelihood they're throwing the cops to wolves but we shouldn't act like liberals and make assumptions before the evidence comes out.	20
1	I think I know enough about the prosecutors conflict of interest and politically charged comments. She is not dispassionate.   &gt; This is *our* fight.   That is a disgusting comment from a prosecutor announcing criminal charges.   I may not be able to comment on the guilt of the police but I can comment on the misbehavior of the prosecutor.	20
1	The Constitutional Law Professor failing Constitutional Law yet again.	20
1	The proper inverse would be "Are more cops killed BY BLACK PEOPLE than black people are killed by cops?".  Because this current stat isn't actually proving anything.	20
1	We have satellite data now and it doesn't support the alarmist global warming predictions based on tampered ground data.  I think the fact that global warming supporters keep using the ground data is proof that a political agenda exists.   [Link on accuracy](http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1997/essd06oct97_1/)  [Link on satellite findings](http://news.yahoo.com/nasa-data-blow-gaping-hold-global-warming-alarmism-192334971.html;_ylt=A0LEVxOV8ERVOKkAg5xXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEzb2h0MGpyBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMzBHZ0aWQDVklQMjgxXzEEc2VjA3Ny)	20
1	&gt;Martin Luther King Jr. said, “A riot is the language of the unheard.” When he said that, none of America’s major cities had a black mayor. The country did not have back-to-back black attorneys general. The country did not have a black president elected — and reelected.? Baltimore’s riot is the tragic language of modern welfare state.	20
1	&gt; So what are you trying to imply here? That it's all a hoax? Why doesn't anyone here just say what they mean ?  Unlike the left which tells you what and how you have to think we give you the facts and allow you to create your own opinion on an issue.	20
1	Law Prof Alan Dershowitz says the criminal charges are a cluster and will result in numerous acquittals. Convictions will be reversed on appeal.	20
1	I never said he supported rioting. I just think that this comic incorrectly oversimplifies things.	20
1	The miscarriage of justice is a man killed in police custody and no one has an answer on how it occurred. The miscarriage of justice is a man arrested for committing no crime and ends up dead.  I like Clarke, but he is seriously off base on this one.	20
1	Yeah, how *dare* police enforce the fucking law, when black privilege obviously demands that they can commit crimes with impunity?  The ignorant fool is probably still hung up "hands up, don't shoot" and the other outright lies we've seen so far.	20
1	Why isn't the government doing anything?   Democrats want the illegal votes. Republicans trying to stop it don't want to be accused of Racism™.   Pretty easy to answer.	20
1	Damn it.  I hate to ruin a good story with inconvenient facts, but this figure is misleading.  This counts deaths in the line of duty from all causes, which as the 2015 statistics show, are most frequently traffic-related.  http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/  Guns don't kill people, cars do.	20
1	Boehner and Pelosi are different people? It's hard to tell at times.	20
1	It also said she has a 38% very unfavorable to Boehner's 27%.  None of the 4 should be in leadership positions.	20
1	You mean the same cops that arrested him. Do you mean the same cops who was under his care that ignored his pleas and calls for medical care? Do you mean the same cops who still haven't provide an valid, scientifically backed reason for how he died in their care? Do you mean those cops who lied about how many stops they made before reaching the police station after arresting him? Yeah, I don't believe those guys. Neither should you.	20

1	This shouldn't be a question because it's not an opinion. Hillary IS dishonest and she'll get away with it too until there's irrefutable proof otherwise.	20
1	&gt; But to the broader point the original article alludes to, even if the numbers are open to interpretation, policing is an inherently dangerous occupation, and law enforcement deserves some sympathy.  Not even in the top ten for dangerous occupations.    http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/28/charted-the-20-deadliest-jobs-in-america/  They signed up knowing what they are getting into.

You also have no idea of the situation he could be in and you aren't in a place to judge is standing in the workforce because of that.	20

1	All of the above brought to you by the Democratic Party, including Jim Crow.	20
1	&gt;But as far as "silencing dissent" goes, it's not the gays you need to worry about anymore. It's the anti-binary radfem SJW who aren't even willing to compromise, and even attack us gay guys as being the epitome of the patriarchy!  It was never 'the gays'. It was always the LGBT activists, who are pretty much one and the same as SJWs, and who brook no dissent whatsoever.  And 'tradition and the bible' doesn't seem to nearly sum up the opposing view here, unless constitutional precedent and intention is just 'tradition' now. In which case, it's a tradition versus tradition argument.	20
1	Quite a bit goes into the failure of a city other than the leadership. The primary industry, technological advances, and economic climate play a much larger role than many of the figurehead leaderships mentioned.   If the Democratic leadership is to blame for the failure of Baltimore, then would the failures of San Bernardino and Jefferson County be the fault of their Republican leadership? If poverty and economic disparity are the indicators, then should we blame Republican leadership for running [almost all of the 10 poorest states in the US](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathryndill/2014/10/13/the-richest-and-poorest-states-in-2014/2/)?  Or, is something more complex involved that can't be easily solved by just fingerpointing...?	20
1	Liberals can never actually fix problems because they never actually acknowledge the facts that are causing the problem.	20

1	&gt; After one commenter suggested that it was unacceptable for anyone who is black or female to like Paul  And there's the openly-practiced racism of the left.  They think that if you're black, you have an obligation to agree with their socially parasitic and disastrous policies.    Allowing black people think for themselves is something they cannot and will not consider, they consider blacks the property of the left, and they just want to keep Toby on the plantation at all costs.	20
1	You don't think that the policies enacted by the government has an effect on the economic climate?  Why is one side of the Rio Grande rich and the other poor?  What differentiates them?  Corrupt kleptocratic governments are bad for business.  They stifle investment and economic growth.	20
1	1. San Bernardino county is the LARGEST county in the nation, how you are blaming the unemployment and economic status on a republican in the BLUEST STATE IN THE NATION is beyond me.  2. In those 10 poorest, how many states have   All republican council leaders?  3. Why is it that /r/politics gets away with pointing fingers all day, yet /r/conservative gets criticized for it?	20
1	&gt;If poverty and economic disparity are the indicators, then should we blame Republican leadership for running [almost all of the 10 poorest states in the US](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathryndill/2014/10/13/the-richest-and-poorest-states-in-2014/2/)?

1	Boom...   It's like I thought it so much that someone else felt it across the country and was inspired to write it and publish it. Cheers Crowder!	20
1	Single motherhood is heavily subsidized by the democrats. You get more of what you incentivize.	20
1	Republicans fairly consistently take positions against those two things, looking for ways to reduce them.  In contrast, Democrats pander to [single mothers](http://patriotupdate.com/articles/why-the-democrats-pandering-to-unwed-mothers-is-a-bad-idea/) and [drug users](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/story/2012-06-19/Drug-legalization-pot-marijuana-decriminalization-medical/55690090/1), establishing a symbiotic relationship with the result that single mothers vote Democrat at 75% and drug users vote Democrat at 83%.	20
1	&gt; **Human** Feces  That's generous.	20
1	The point is that the whole idea behind "planned parenthood" is to literally avoid bringing children into broken homes.	20
1	What is going on with this quote...  &gt; There is another downside to single parenting that does not show up in crime statistics but that, in its own way, is just as bad for American society.  I speak here of the contributions unwed mothers make to the on-going feminization of American society when they raise their boys to be girls.  Anyways...Maybe dems are pandering to single women, they probably are, but you can't deny that the literal objective of planned parenthood is to prevent children from growing up in broken homes. I think we can all agree that's good for society.	20
1	&gt;  literal objective of planned parenthood is to prevent children from growing up in broken homes.  No.  [Read their mission statement](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/who-we-are/mission).  They're about preventing *unwanted* births with no regard whatsoever to whether the mother is single or not, it has nothing to do with "broken homes".  Democrat programs [actually incentivize single motherhood](http://time.com/27708/my-neighborhood-makes-it-easier-to-get-pregnant-than-to-go-to-college/).	20
1	Can we at least agree that preventing unwanted pregnancies is good for society? It will cut down on the number of single mothers and bad parents raising shitty children.	20

1	CNN photoshopped their images to look white lol	20
1	10th amendment is pretty clear that the Feds have no say over items not specified in the constitution; thus it is explicitly NOT the job of the Supreme Court to make rulings on these matters.   For example, there is no specific provision in the constitution regarding marriage, nor abortion. What you consider a civil right is something the Feds have no business imposing.	20
1	If Rebublicans really wanted to reduce the incidences of single motherhood, they wouldn't constantly be trying to gut sex ed programs every chance they get.	20
1	Well 'chickenshit' isn't strong enough. At least chicken shit makes great fertilizer and provides jobs for people at chicken farms.	20
1	And then where will you buy food, clothing, and all the other little life essentials?   What happens when your community has no economic engine?   Some of these people are not thinking clearly.   Most businesses probably will leave the community. Baltimore with no more tax base is just Detroit. Then all the rioters can wallow in squalor in the bed that they made, while the 'intellectuals' blame white conservatives.	20

1	Remind me again how well that abstinence only sex ed does to reduce teen pregnancy. The fact of the matter is, teens are going to have sex.  The least we can do as a society is to give them information on how to prevent unwanted pregnancy and how to do it safely.    As for positions, I have never heard of a sex ed class teaching positions before.  It is possible I suppose.	20
1	&gt; democraticunderground.com  I have the stomach for just about anything...so I visited your website link. Wow. Just...wow. I found this gem in the comment section:  &gt;Should be an aggravated Hate Crime.   &gt;Can you blame the 2 victims for defending their religion against Islamophobes?   &gt;Why do some people think their right to free speech includes hate speech?  I can't tell if this person is a troll, instigator, or insane. Either way, the comments below this gem where in agreement that our freedom of speech trumps the freedom people have to massacre a population that they don't agree with.	20
1	It's not. That's why Islam is always battling Western values. The two cannot coexist. Now pick a side and fight to defeat the other.  Either that or direct them back at each other. Thereby the Sunni and Shiites will continue to kill each other like the animals they are.	20
1	I *really* want to see the contestants' works.	20

1	Free Speech is now "asking" for Islamic attacks.  That's what the MSM is telling us.	20
1	&gt;"I see myself as a member of 'we the people,'" he told the Associated Press in an interview earlier this year, arguing that his lack of experience is an asset.  &gt;"I see myself as a logical American who has common sense," he continued, "and I think that's going to resonate with a lot of American, regardless of their political party."	20
1	When a "news" person asks a question, [the answer is always "No"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines)	20
1	This is what the left has been prepping for.	20
1	I thought it was cashew chicken with a small side salad.	20
1	Typical spineless journalist. Preface every statement with "questions are being asked" or "people are saying" to defer any responsibility for your words onto nameless other people.	20
1	yeah..but but but..the GOP doesn't invest into 'urban' areas. What a joke. Way too many uneducated/ignorant people out there now.	20
1	Yes.  Look how all those "teens" in Baltimore acted... Their mothers were such role models...	20
1	Not driving while drunk and driving g while drunk are examples of drunk driving.	20
1	How does one spend money on tax cuts?	20
1	Shut up.  This is a free country, and the right to peaceably assemble is so inherently built in the "poking the bear" is insanity.  All those people well-knew the risks involved.  When the "Urine Madonna" "art" came out, no one talked about "poking the bear" of Catholics.  When Neil Degrasse Tyson or Bill Nye say the most ridiculous remarks about religion in general, no one says they're "poking the bear."  It's only explained away when the Radical Islamists are involved.	20
1	Regardless of how one feels about Pam Gellar, her message, and her organization, you can't deny how much those gunman validated her whole agenda. Those gunmen did exactly what they were supposed to do as far as Gellar is concerned.	20
1	&gt;It's only explained away when the ~~Radical Islamists~~ **Muslims** are involved.	20
1	I don't think he'll win, lack of foreign policy and general policy experience will be too easy to exploit on a national platform, but he'll do a good job of articulating the conservative position and moving the conversation to the right, but in the right manner.  Enough Bachmans and Santorums and Perrys, get someone up there who can speak intelligently about concepts we understand and wish to spread to others.	20
1	Pam Gellar is an American hero. A lot of people talk about the Islam problem but she's brave enough to make herself visible and be proactive about it. Draw Muhammad contests should come to every major city in America so that more anti-Islam voices can be heard. I would be glad to have my tax dollars pay for extra protection to let free speech thrive.	20
1	Yes, that's the real problem.  Democrats aren't agreeing though.  They're blaming Republicans for not sending inner cities more money.  They don't say a thing about police unions and how they protect bad officers, and then they try to use this as a way to give their crony's more money.	20
1	Liberal professor blames the victims when Muslims shoot innocent people.  Also, water is wet, the sky is blue, the sun rises in the East.	20
1	Soon, Sexual Violence will include "having a dick while looking in the general direction of a woman".	20
1	&gt;  lack of foreign policy and general policy experience  No one held that against Obama...	20
1	Sounds like this 'investment' is working out about as well as anything else Obama and his hapless minions have thrown money at.	20
1	Yep. Right out of the Garry Trudeau playbook.   What a bunch of spineless cowards.	20
1	Does it count as sexual violence if a woman withholds sex from a man? I have a feeling their answer is no.	20
1	Tapper is obviously the guy who should have replaced Russert.  I don't get the sense that Tapper is a conservative;  he just seems like an actual journalist.	20
1	It gets better than that!  Liberal director *of the Islamic Studies program* blames the victims when Muslims shoot innocent people.	20
1	Wow, does he believe that no one is going to call him out after they read between the lines?  &gt;Prayers for all reeling from #GarlandShooting.  2 groups are responsible:  those who fired bullets, and #AFDI who fan flames of hatred.  Translation: If you make fun of my religion, bad things will happen.  Fuck off, this is the United States. If you don't like free-speech I hear ISIS is recruiting.	20
1	You mean like, if someone draws a picture of the Blessed Virgin using human feces? It got really violent after that, didn't it? Actually it didn't.	20
1	Everyone I hear on the news is saying Baltimore is victimized economically.	20
1	Gee, I don't know.  Were the marchers in Selma in 1965 asking to be attacked by the State Troopers?  Did they get what was coming to them?	20
1	The person who threw gas on it can be blamed for putting gas on it.	20
1	But the problem is that these other things *are happening*!  Jewish rabbis are mocked *all the time*, and Christian theology is essentially treated as an ongoing joke in the media, academia, and entertainment.  But the moment a "muhammed" art exhibit comes up, some maniac tries to shoot the place up.  If your point that mocking Jews and Christians isn't happening, then you live in a hole, because it's pretty much nonstop.	20
1	So what did he get wrong and what is "racist" about the article?	20
1	So you have nothing specific nor can you point out how it's racist.  Thanks for being such a deep thinker.	20
1	Brought to you by a member of the religion of assholes &amp; imbeciles, probably a *card-carrying* Democrat as well, if he's showing this epic level of intolerance.  Amazing how well some of their newer demographics echo their former KKK days, trying to solve social tensions with violence, both here and in Baltimore.	20
1	Baltimore's police commissioner saying they didn't act on the looters the first night because they were mostly teenagers and they didn't want to "hurt children" was the most disturbing part of this event for me.  I mean I guess if you're a teen, you have a free pass to pillage now.	20
1	Ironic you should use that phrase considering the firehose-cutting guy.	20
1	Because assimilation means they might actually learn to love America, break free of the mentality of liberal dependency, and help promote a more stable society; and the Democrats can't have that.	20
1	When I get my new upper I'm totally getting this dust cover.  http://imgur.com/GbTfC4V	20
1	How does that effect free speech?  And anyway, mocking references of Jesus is clearly blasphemy, which is clearly banned.    You're grasping at straws.	20
1	The link between social spending and riots is that social spending is allegedly supposed to make its recipients into peaceful, successful, educated, law-abiding citizens who contribute to their community and don't use drugs or burn down their own city.	20
1	My guess is that people still use the ER as their primary care and were less afraid of going because they are now insured. Unfortunately, those same people were not educated on preventative care or the benefits of establishing a primary doctor. I bet if people were better informed in the first place that a co-pay is cheaper than an ER bill, ER visits would not have increased.	20
1	&gt; Local police, a SWAT team, FBI and ATF agents were on hand for the event  Considering this, and the amount spent of added security, one would hope they could manage to outgun to guys. If not that's a serious problem.	20
1	&gt; But that said  Ah the part when you contradict yourself!	20
1	No surprise here....	20
1	Don't worry, most of that "investment" was intangible union and community organizer kick backs, not actual infrastructure.	20
1	I'll bet they looked *real hard*, too.  Honest. /s	20
1	Two down. So many to go.	20
1	let me guess, it was a corrupt republican police department that killed Freddi Gray? OH wait! it's all democratic.	20
1	The 97% consensus is a big lie.  http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303480304579578462813553136  http://www.climatechangecommunication.org/report/american-meteorological-society-member-survey-global-warming-preliminary-findings-february	20
1	'Outgunned at a suburban art show' is hilarious. I'd never thought of it that way before.   Apparently, terrorists never got the memo that Texas is not a good place to stage a terrorist attack.	20
1	Recent phenomena.  Those states mostly became red in the late 80s.  Mostly.  The hundred years before that?  All Democrats:  [List of governors of Mississippi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Mississippi)  [List of governors of Alabama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Alabama)  [List of governors of West Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_West_Virginia)  [Louisiana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Louisiana)  [South Carolina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_South_Carolina)  And it goes on.  Sorry, but Democrats don't get to wring dry entire regions of the country and then blame it on Republicans when the people finally wake up.	20
1	Would probably work better if the red one posted a screencapped comment of the blue one saying something to that effect.	20
1	Wouldn't expect anything else from *this* State Department either.	20
1	I'm not a native Texan, but as a former resident I'm feeling some pride. DON'T MESS WITH TEXAS!	20
1	According to news reports, the joyful jihadis joined Mohammad due to a traffic cop's straight shooting with his service pistol. They weren't outgunned, they were outshot.	20
1	Gun control means using both hands.	20
1	We'll also have to call them "sexist" for criticizing Carly Fiorina.	20
1	Actually, a lot of historical societies practiced polygamy, including those in the Bible. Interracial marriages were legally disallowed until Loving v. Virginia (1967) banned them. Societies adapt. Our constitution permits that. I am a strong proponent of preserving individual rights. The government should not be involved in individual households. If two loving, consenting individuals joining together is detrimental to society, then God help us. It is not, though. Let us as a society finally give these people the rights they deserve.	20
1	Regardless of how he does, the shitstorm this causes is going to be amazing to watch unfold.	20
1	I think you mean... Oh, how the turn tables.	20
1	The difference here is Ben Carson was actually seriously poor when he was a kid.   Hear his story, it's incredible. I want him somewhere in government, maybe not president just yet, but soon. He'd do an excellent job with internal issues.	20
1	Sometimes you have to throw the absurdity back at them to demonstrate how stupid it is.  If you just accept it, they'll keep doing it.	20
1	The difference is that we do it in jest only to highlight the irony of the Liberals who did it in earnest.	20
1	The voting body can be wrong. The executive branch can be wrong. The House and Senate can be wrong. Even the Constitution can be wrong.   The fact that gay marriage was voted down doesn't mean it's not the right thing to do.   The avenues to overturn decisions made act as checks, balancing power and inviting dissenting voices. Through disagreement and argument, do we not create a more perfect union?   The judges should rightfully not consider the voting trend on gay marriage. What is often popular is not often right. The decision should be made from logic, not external influence.	20
1	Exactly.  You're only authentically black if you're half-white and raised by middle-class white folk in the same state as *Superman.*  Duh.	20
1	In charge of the VA is my thoughts.	20
1	How come every time the rules go against tard ideology they are deemed no longer applicable ?	20
1	Already has 5 NYT best sellers.  And how many more books did Obama sell once he started running...	20
1	Not to mention had a movie made about his life...	20
1	Oh, I'm sure they'll blame Reagan for that too.	20
1	This is insanity. I have been to Haiti and seen true poverty. These people calling for $15 an hour? Bullshit. I've seen people in Haiti who would KILL THEIR OWN CHILDREN for half of that per hour. For $5 an hour hell. 8ve seen children spend all day breaking apart boulders to sell small rocks for foundations and HOPE they might earn 50c. These people have no idea what hardship is and they should be thankful that they work for a company like this.	20
1	This "living wage" bullshit is right out of Marx: "to each according to his need".  It doesn't matter what your *expenses* are, if your work isn't worth higher wages, it's not conscionable to demand them anyway.  If you didn't want to rely on a shitty-paying job, you should have made better choices.  They company is already struggling, what exactly do these idiots think will happen?	20
1	I believe McDonalds has developed a way to make a mostly robotic Mcdonalds. At a certain point, its easier to replace all the workers than put up with nonsense like this.  That woman put up with working at McDonalds for 3 years while apparently not making enough money. Why not find another job? I refuse to believe that someone who can hold down a job for that long can't find another job doing something else.  Flipping burgers isn't a career and shouldn't be paid like one. If the pay them $15 an hour, I won't eat there anymore	20
1	Of course, because they're a "religion of peace."	20
1	So now the employee who by law can make $15 can't find a job to pay him/her that because they've all gone out of business.   Brilliant!  Math is hard for liberals.	20
1	Stupid people making bad life choices and stuck in entry level jobs intended for high school kids. Underachievers will always be underachievers. We have machines that dig ditches and soon we'll have machines that flip burgers.	20
1	One thing that's mystifying is how supposed "liberals" are crawling up over each other to limit free speech over this.  If someone had shot up a gay pride parade, would they feel the same way?  "Don't poke the bear?" Hell, no.  Just goes to show, the left is populated with inconsistent idiots.  But of course, inconsistent idiots are okay with that.	20
1	IMO his knife being illegal is irrelevant to the case.	20
1	CNN is miffed with the outcome of the jihadi vs. cowboy story. Apparently, these poor pious Prophet protectors were victims of cruel cartoonists who lured them to an unfair fight. That the Moslems had murder on their minds is not the issue as the only real crime here is insulting Islam. Nice that these breathless broadcast babes can pause in their race riot promotions to bash Texas for defending freedom. It s a wonder these news readers still know how to breathe.	20
1	I don't think he has a chance against Cruz, Paul or Walker.	20
1	To the media case it is. Since the fucking prosecutor claimed the knife was legal, because she was rushing and bullshitting to appease the democratic machine's own mob	20
1	Whether they had probable cause to detain him or not seems highly relevant to their intent and motive.	20
1	A known drug dealer in the area with a knife... what could he possibly be up to?	20
1	How did they blame Reagan when he left in '89 and the riots were in '92?   edit: oh right, leftism	20
1	They'll use racist/sexist rhetoric against minorities who disagree with their ideology or don't toe the party line. Lord knows how much Black conservatives have to endure the "Uncle Tom" charge, or reporters like Megan Kelly are belittled for being blonde and attractive.	20
1	Being a liberal is a lot of work.  You need to constantly stay informed on the edicts of the elite.  You wake up and think that you know the definition of "thug"...but then find out that thug is the new N word.  People come in and shoot people at a meeting, you're upset.  You were told how horrible guns are, but wait....the shooters were muslims....so it's OK.  Some way to live when you can't ever think logically and for yourself.  Just memorize the chants and rants and spout them out.	20
1	The police officers had probable cause to arrest Gray the moment that he ran from them. Nobody is disputing that Gray ran.   After that, the illegal knife is irrelevant, correct.   If the question is "Did police have probable cause to arrest Gray?", the answer is "Yes, absolutely".	20
1	You're wrong. Courts, including the SCOTUS have long upheld that simply running from police is probable cause, particularly if there are aggravating circumstances, such as being in a high-crime area, or being a known drug dealer to the police. Both things are in play here.   Gray was out on bail at the time for possession of heroin in March. He'd already been arrested 4 times in 2015 alone, so I'm sure the arresting officers were more than familiar with him.	20
1	&gt;a poor inner-city boy who became one of the world’s most accomplished neurosurgeons — his emergence as a conservative hero and unabashed critic of the United States’ first black president has been jarring.  You mean people can have opinions that aren't based on someone's skin color?  Like, almost as if the shade of someone's skin has no bearing on who they are as a person...  HOLY S**T... you're kidding me!	20
1	They should be asking why drawing pictures gets people killed in their society	20
1	I agree the media is biased, but I think this title and the article by Newsbusters are both misleading.  The NYT story described herein covered what **Clinton** said. It describes what a future presidential candidate said while calling out the current and former president on a racial uprising in LA. It does not place blame without citing to the very public face that was the source of the comments.  I'm sure if a current presidential candidate publicly lambasted president Obama as the source for the Baltimore race issues, the Times would report it. That said, I don't believe it's happened, yet.	20
1	&gt; That said, I don't believe it's happened, yet.  [It has.](http://cdanews.com/2015/04/ted-cruz-blames-obama-for-situation-in-baltimore/)	20
1	Depictions Jesus dipped into a jar of piss and hardcore fisting porn are sacraments of the Left, cartoons of Mohammed take it too far.  Tell me I'm wrong.   #Priorities	20
1	If the media won't allow cartoons of Mohamed, what other elements of sharia law will they adhere too?	20
1	That's because the idea of the Protestant Reformation was so people could read and decide for themselves.	20
1	You. I like you.	20
1	No.  Liberals have the automatic high horse, which is why Liberal Tolerance is defined as they are right, Conservatives are wrong...instantly.  So, every word becomes offensive, Conservatives are always in the wrong for offending and Liberals get free reign to speak up and call them offensive for it.	20
1	I don't even care whether there was probable cause or not. As soon as he is in custody, he is also under their protection. He died from a spinal injury, during which he suffered 3 broken vertebrae. That is fucking unacceptable.	20
1	She's been ranked one of the worst tech CEOs of all time by a variety of sources. This is somehow a good thing?	20
1	Rand Paul would pull so many independents  it would be a landslide	20
1	&gt; We knew that the target was protected. Our intention was to show how easy we give our lives for the Sake of Allah.  Mission accomplished.  Your boys went down very easily.  I look forward to seeing more of them gunned down by Americans.  More and more Americans are buying guns and getting their CC licenses.  I don't think this is going to go the way you think it will, asshats.	20
1	Nope, we have free speech.  This is a non-starter.  Besides -- when was Christianity ever protected from satire?  Islam is the religion of assholes and imbeciles and fuck every single person who thinks it ought to be illegal to criticize it.	20
1	Bring it on douchenozzels. We weren't scared of the British, Mexicans, Spanish, Nazis, Kamakazes...hell we went to war with ourselves once....you goat lovers won't make me run.	20
1	From wikipedia "Piss Christ"  &gt;Piss Christ is a 1987 photograph by the American artist and photographer Andres Serrano. It depicts a small plastic crucifix submerged in a glass of the artist's urine. The piece was a winner of the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art's "Awards in the Visual Arts" competition,[1] which was sponsored in part by the National Endowment for the Arts, a United States Government agency that offers support and funding for artistic projects, without controlling content.	20
1	He definitely has a really good shot at winning, but with all due respect, the Republican Party primaries (at least in 2012) makes the candidates be so far right to win that Rand's chances of getting out of the primaries are really low	20
1	inb4 cries about Westboro's protests being just as bad as terrorist attacks.	20
1	How did that win an award? There's nothing groundbreaking about it	20
1	How the fuck does it represent the commercializing of religion? And how would a drawing of Muhammad be any more offensive?	20
1	&gt;beautiful depiction  A cross in a jar of piss? Beautiful? Are you fucking autistic?  &gt;[Edit: Just realized this is in r/Conservative. I now realize why all the downvotes. Contemporary art probably isn't in your wheelhouse.]  Oh fuck you, Libby. Go look at Greco, Dahli, and Picasso, and please tell me to my face that a "display of art" that took this libshit five minutes to set up is somehow still "art" in comparison.	20
1	Don't call him autistic. One of my best friends is on the spectrum and would never say something as half-brained as that.	20
1	This reminds me of when leftist idol Glen Greenwald posted [a bunch of anti-semitic images] (https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/01/09/solidarity-charlie-hebdo-cartoons/) out of rage of Charlie Hebdo's satire and the subsequent support for them over the terror attack.  It's not just a juvenile mindset, it's disturbing.	20
1	YOU PEOPLE? YOU PEOPLE?	20
1	&gt; So let us suppose that the picture is meant as a criticism of the billion-dollar Christ-for-profit industry and the commercialization of spiritual values that permeates our society.  And you are impressed by this idiotic doublespeak? The piece has multiple meanings, but I'll just posit the hypothetical that it is the most non inflammatory meaning possible. Of course, we all know that's not the 'real' meaning. *Wink, wink.*   Edit: Actually u/wish123 actually is quite versed in the exact same doublespeak. Notice the phrasing "It **could just as easily be** about the co-modification and commercialization of religion."	20
1	Coming from that beacon of shameless leftist propaganda aside (the Huffington Post), that is a total cop out. Are we supposed to be so credulous to believe that was the artist's true intent, one he absolutely failed miserably at conveying by choosing the most overtly inflammatory symbology he could find? I tend to accept the simplest explanation, which is that this interpretation is nothing but weaselly backpedaling. The piece meant exactly what it appeared to mean, that Christianity is as worthless as a bodily excrement. It was meant to be seen as brave and edgy by his client base the artsy secular left by insulting a group of individuals who are loathed by them.	20
1	I love that moral equivalence. That one's a hoot to me.   The WBC is less than 60 people who think that 'G_d Hates Fags' and are merely an annoyance, and non-violent.   Radical Islam is *millions* of people who believe that 'Allah Hates Fags', so they execute them. Islamists are an annoyance, and they're violent.   It's a pretty large distinction.	20
1	Most Christians would specifically say that God loves gay people and they are just as imperfect as they are. The Bible itself says that.  I don't see how people don't realize that the roughly 40 people in the WBC don't at all represent Christianty. Also while the WBC are disgusting individuals, at least they aren't killing people!	20
1	You mean like the same kind of death threats that every single American politician and celebrity gets?  pssssh.  The douchebag who created Piss Christ getting death threats doesn't mean that Christians are any more insane than Americans at large when you consider who common death threats are on any given controversy or famous person.	20
1	Right.  Why should my tax dollars reward self-indulgent perverts?  Want to photograph BDSM ass fucking and sacrilege?  Do it on your own dime.	20
1	It truly is incredible to see the mental acrobatics the Left goes through to push anti-Christian and pro-atheist agendas all day long and then turn around and suddenly have reverence for Islam.  I'd have more respect for them if they were at least consistent.	20
1	&gt;I don't see how people don't realize that the roughly 40 people in the WBC don't at all represent Christianity.  Ironically they're willing to make this exact argument in favor of Islamic terrorists.   Also inb4 some liberal smart ass comes in and calls me a hypocrite for applying the standard of a "small group" of extremists not representing the majority only to Christians and not Muslims: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7TAAw3oQvg	20
1	It was pretty clear the Mosby is a flaming idiot when she admitted to a political motive for filing charges (i.e. responding to the demands of the mob).  Even so, this is epic incompetence.	20
1	Also, it looks like he was severely dehydrated.	20
1	prepare for the downvote brigade!!!	20
1	"She felt uncomfortable at the school and it was the first time she ever felt uncomfortable"   there's a problem if your first time "feeling uncomfortable" comes in high school at the sight of a fucking flag used in an apolitical context. It's unbelievable how sensitive and sheltered some people are these days.	20
1	Are you saying the Ministry of Truth rewrites history to fit the current lies of the regime? Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia.	20
1	Did they get government approval to dig all those holes?	20
1	Does anyone have NOAA's explanation for why they are adjusting previous temperature data?  I'd really like to hear their justification.	20
1	I think you should post this in \r\science and ask that exact question :)	20
1	Came here to say the same thing, since when is the Confederate flag a symbol of hate wtf?  I recently moved down South people still have this flag high and waving in their lawns.  They don't see it as hateful at all.	20
1	Lol, I can hear the chorus of "denier" already.  Which is sad, because I'm generally curious.	20
1	&gt; ... The first order of business for AG Loretta Lynch should be to appoint a special counsel who can convene a grand jury to look into the Obama IRS outrages.  Oh yeah ... *that'll* happen. Sigh.	20
1	Maybe I am missing something, but I don't get it.  Edit: Never mind, I am an idiot. I didn't see that was sand. I though they were praying towards Mecca or something.	20
1	OMG! Businesses *mark up* the things that they sell? Stop the presses!   Auto dealerships don't make much profit on a brand new car. They make a lot more on used cars generally.   Every retail business on planet Earth marks their merchandise up more than they paid for it. That's how businesses work. They have rent, bills, employees to pay, and profits to be made, otherwise there's no business. How could Princess Running Bullshit here not know that?	20
1	Those RINOs and the media trying to set the crown of nomination on Jeb's head must not be very happy.  Conservatives should be.	20
1	He's probably the only Republican I would refuse to vote for in the general election.	20
1	Obama has to be the most criminal president every to occupy the white house.  the damage he has done to the office of President may never be undone.  and the worst part is the brainwashed obama sycophants refuse to even believe there could be wrongdoing by their savior.	20
1	There's a lot of money to be made with the Great Global Warming Con.	20
1	They're obviously adjusting for inflation.	20
1	Found an article with NOAAs explanation:  http://www.factcheck.org/2015/02/nothing-false-about-temperature-data/	20
1	I can't tell if you're actually wanting an explanation of why the NOAA adjusts numbers, but [here you go](http://climatecenter.fsu.edu/does-noaa-adjust-historical-climate-data).	20
1	They say they account for things like switching from glass analog thermometers to digital (they absorb heat and light differently), change based on re-calibration data, if the surroundings for a temp probe are changed (put up a building next to it that might warm it up or take down a tree shading it), stuff like that.  NOAAs web site says any specific data someone is concerned about can be explained if asked. Dunno how much that helps here, it sounds like people want a witch hunt. I read the article and was outraged by the graph and data but after reading about why they do it, it sounds legit to me.	20
1	It shows the uselessness of the US media that the IRS scandal has faded from the headlines.	20
1	Electing a black president will do nothing for race relations if that president is a shameless racialist who will make relations worse to further his own ends.	20
1	It really is a brilliant political move:  shut down the debate, label people as "deniers", and say the sky is falling.  They've been overplaying their hand lately and I see a lot of people starting to doubt it all since the world should've ended about 100 different times in the past 20 years.	20
1	Oh you've gotta be kidding me. Just when I think Michelle Antoinette Obama has said the dumbest sentence ever uttered, she tops herself.	20
1	Not just that, but have you noticed how the media has completely ignored Walker for months?  They spent a little time trying to smear him, he fought back and made them look like the fools that they are over and over, which was a joy to watch.  Now they dare not mention Walker. They can't take him down. He makes them deranged.	20
1	As a scientist yourself, maybe you should read the accompanying article that fully explains why the change was made.	20
1	Good.  Two Bushes is enough for the next 500 years.     I'll take a Walker or Paul please.	20
1	If it was Clinton v Bush in 2016 first I'd wonder if I was in a bad episode of Quantum Leap.   Then I'd stay home.	20
1	If it's from the govt (which manipulates almost every stat out there) --- YES.	20
1	Nearly 50 years under Democratic leadership is pretty tragic.	20
1	I think we should be posting Pictures Of Mohammed (Reese's Pieces be upon him) Everywhere. On Billboards, internet, and every street corner. Just to show that we can do what we want here in America.	20
1	And this is the group that the state run media uses to label everyone a hate group.  When are they going to add their own organization to the hate list since they inspired the FRC shooting and gave Bill Ayers a voice in their magazine?	20
1	Im amazed that people still watch CNN...	20
1	Dr. Caroline Swain broke down the SPLC very well here...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrBdiLgmfdc	20
1	There is zero credibility with the SPLC in reality.  It just shows how corrupt the media when they still use them to smear conservatives.  They are literally endangering the lives of people who are practicing free speech by posting their names and locations.  I can't help but think that the left would have been all too happy if Gellar and others were massacred by these jihadists.	20
1	The FBI dropped them in 2014.  5 years too late if you ask me.	20
1	I think I'll start a hate group list and the SPLC will be first on the list.	20
1	&gt;"Museums And Concert Halls” Just Don’t Welcome Non-White Kids  Hmmmmm...I wonder why?   Could it be the same reason white movie goers cringe when they see a large contingent of blacks in the audience? They know that during the movie, that crowd will be talking, swearing and yelling at the screen.  It's a behavioral issue. Behave yourself and you're always welcome. Don't, and your not.	20
1	Cue a bunch of illegal women getting pregnant before coming over the border so that they can get amnesty here in the United States.	20
1	That's nuts. A parent has the responsibility to ensure that their child has as much of an advantage as possible. "Other people's children" shouldn't come into the equation.	20
1	&gt; certain kinds of crime (nonviolent drug offenses, mostly) turn small-time criminals in violent career felons  I guess you are right, expecting people to not break the law is just too much to ask...  edit: I mean, men gotta rape right?	20
1	The Southern Poverty Law Center has long ago abandoned any sense of political neutrality, and today it gladly plays it's role as a mouth piece for the multitude of voices on the left.	20
1	They were already deranged, Walker just provides a contrast to them.	20
1	Funny race relations seem to always get worse when there's a democrat in the oval office. Seems they use the bully pulpit to fan flames.	20
1	In the future my children will have to compete with other people's children for jobs, opportunities, and chances to excel in society. I read to my children for the very reason that it will give them an unfair advantage over their peers.	20
1	This can't be real...  Holy fuck	20
1	The African American community will always blame the whites for how they are treated, rather than look into their own community to solve their problems from a cultural and family based standpoint.    This is why I support people like Bill Cosby and Dr Ben Carson, because they challenge their community to make change.     Unfortunately, the liberals see anyone who isn't white and male and sides with conservatives as a "traitor" and are subsequently pulled apart.	20
1	"On a basic level, PEG teaches that minority students don’t do as well as white students on the average because traditional American education is structured around white cultural norms, which are frequently difficult for minority students to grasp."  This country is going to shit and now we know why.	20
1	Oh yea, Sowell's writing is amazing. He's in his 80s now I believe, it's going to be a sad day when he leaves us.	20
1	As a former teacher I can assure you many teachers are not fond of this either.	20
1	Is there someplace one can go to sign up for membership on this "hate group" list?	20
1	Apparently, since our schools are failing a minority of their students, society must necessarily be restructured to accommodate that benighted minority. Restructured not to lift up the bottom, rather it is everyone else who must be reeducated till they conform to the collective cowardice called Political Correctness.	20
1	The SPLC is just a talking piece for the left. Anything that is seemingly conservative will get blasted and will be listed as a hate group. With that logic anyone who disagrees with my political ideology is in a hate group. See how it works?	20
1	Ditto, thanks for the advice professor, I will read to them and read to them (when I have them of course) so they can surpass and be better than everyone else, and no I do not feel bad for the parents that do not read to their kids.  Also, thanks for complimenting my parents on being good parents.       Also, smoke less weed professor.  Reality is waiting for you and most parents read to their kids because they love them not because they are trying to screw over anyone else.	20
1	Evil white values like honesty, hard work, mutual respect, and individual rights.   No wonder minorities lag; when they have defined the elements of success as being "white", they have remaining for themselves only a formula for failure.	20
1	Other people are crippled, so you must shoot yourself in the foot to give them a chance to catch up.	20
1	SPLC couldn't wait to defend terrorists against conservatives. Islamic terrorists that seek to kill...not a hate group. Conservatives expressing their rights...hate group. Liberalism in a nutshell.	20
1	Bill Whittle was FIRED UP!!! Holy crap ...	20
1	The 2nd protects the 1st.  Fuck 'em.	20
1	Fired up Bill Whittle is my favorite Bill Whittle.	20
1	The SPLC is giving in to the assassin's veto - the ultimate hate crime.   And ironically, the guy who won the contest gets death threats for LEAVING the religion the SPLC deems less offensive than the artist.	20
1	Dude ... just draw a Mohammed cartoon!	20
1	"Hate Group List" = Leftist Enemies List. Does anybody take these hacks seriously? Anybody that disagrees with the Statist bullshit agenda is a Hate Group.	20
1	The SPLC also lists the Black Panthers as a hate group, so there's that ...   I think that to the SPLC, any group is a hate group. My elderly mother's Bridge Club is a hate group, I'm sure.   All joking aside, it's kind of sad to see a group of so-called 'educated' people not understand the difference between 'critique' and 'hate'.	20
1	I don't have any children, but I read to my dogs just to be sure.	20
1	The politics involved, the fact you were expected to do more with less, and the fact so many parents have forgotten how to be parents were contributing factors	20
1	It's not the weed. I've smoked a lot of weed today, and I think this is really stupid.   At what point does the left demand that because little Johnny was molested and suffers from emotional problems as a result, we should go ahead and molest the rest of the kids to level the playing field?  It's THAT deranged.	20
1	Or oppose gay "marriage".	20
1	No, according to the liberal mindset it's the governments responsibility to teach your kids, feed your kids, house your kids and provide a job for them.  Liberals want everyone to be equal, even if means we're all at the lowest level.  Personal responsibility is bad as that's the role of government in their twisted logic.	20
1	This is because Democrats solidify their base by stirring up racial tension, which is why they're willing to use extreme dishonesty and propaganda to do so at every opportunity.	20
1	one of my goals in life is to be on that list. better save that for later though	20
1	parents who don't read to their kids should take it easy because my kids will be paying for their kids and their grandkids.	20
1	Yes and women shouldn't 'ask for it' by wearing skirts.	20
1	Sometimes people don't like being told what to do.  [Where is the hatred?](http://www.barenakedislam.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bosch-fawstin.jpeg)	20
1	&gt;In fact, Ms. Mosby was so hasty it appears she locked up two completely innocent officers.  She charged Freddie Gray’s arresting officers with “false imprisonment” because she said the knife that Gray had on him was legal.  In fact, as The Sun reported, the Police Task Force found it to be illegal after all.  It was Ms. Mosby who had no probable cause to lock the arresting officers up, an injustice she could have easily avoided by taking her time.   Damn	20
1	Love or hate him, it's an excellent argument.	20
1	Ah the Trigger Paradox.	20
1	The Nation of Islam is, however, the only Muslim group that's been listed by the SPLC.   They once explained that Jewish groups like the Anti-Defamation League were more appropriate to list Muslim hate-groups.   Not even joking. I guess they'd rather direct any violent attacks towards the ADL than their own offices. Or perhaps they revere the "Prophet" like so much of the modern Left, which only respects religions that kill people over jokes.	20
1	You made no point.	20
1	Is this the same thing as saying a woman deserves to be raped because she was dressed inappropriate?  Because that's what they sound like.	20
1	If only they had jobs they wouldn't be so depressed.  I mean after all... look at our predominantly black cities like Baltimore, Los Angeles, and Brooklyn with all their good paying jobs.	20
1	&gt;I don't  know who's more offensive.... ISIS or insensitive or inflammatory Jewish people  If you have to think about this one, you're probably a liberal.	20
1	What a bind! They have to think, but can't!	20
1	Good thing for Chris Cuomo that the Constitution protects *stupid* speech.	20
1	Hmmm...the radical muslim terror organization that has waged a 10,000 year jihad on western civilization and beheads people for being Christian, Jewish or homosexual or a woman who organized people to draw cartoons.  Which of these two is worse?!?!	20
1	Her message wasn't trying to piss people off, it was to show how our free speech is being encroached upon by extremism and Islamists in particular.	20
1	They're preparing her criminal charges.	20
1	How many police have to be abusive to require reform is like how many TSA agents have to feel people up before we reform them.	20
1	&gt;I don't know who's more offensive... ISIS, or insensitive and inflammatory Jewish people  Well one group draws pictures while one kills everybody who doesn't share their radical, twisted ideology. Yeah, I've got to think about that one too.	20
1	Delusional. I've witnessed plently of police abuse first-hand and heard of it from friends to convince me otherwise, and I'm white and live in a middle-class town. Half of police are bullies and the other half are complacent.	20
1	But they're the only party that cares about black people. Look at how well the black communities in Detroit and Baltimore are doing after 40+ years of Democratic rule. /s	20
1	Those two terrorists who showed up there could have easily gone into a public place where there are no guns and actually taken lives. That cartoon contest saved lives in retrospect, and for you to blame the holder of the contest, you are a true idiot liberal.	20
1	You do know that women are allowed to drive in Islam. The whole "women are lower beings" is a pre-Islamic Middle Eastern cultural issue.	20
1	Toomey is presenting neither.	20
1	I've heard something to the effect that the reason why Islamic culture disenfranchises women is because they actually regard them as sacred. Obviously to Westerners that's completely backwards considering that we have been exposed to progressive degrees of feminism over the course of a century.  At the end of the day, I couldn't care less how they treat their women. In fact, it annoys me whenever Hannity for example has a Muslim guest on, then proceeds to distract/deflect by talking about their female oppression, as if it matters in the grand scheme or is why we are battling them.	20
1	The fact is, the Muslim concept of honor transforms Mohammadan men into fragile glass-like personalities. These brittle brutes need to protect themselves by scaring their surroundings with their aggressive attitude. This phony show of narcissistic rage is very common among Muslims. The fear of criticism is in many cases not far from paranoia. It is not without reason that self-irony and self-criticism is completely absent in the Muslim societies. Seen from a psychological perspective – whose aim is to produce self-confident, happy, free, loving and productive individuals; and not to please a hateful God or culture traditions – Muslim culture is in many ways psychologically unhealthy to grow up in.	20
1	At first, I laughed at this.  But then I thought that, at very least, she better hire a good tax lawyer for her upcoming totally random &amp; not politically motivated in any way IRS audits she will be having.	20

1	That's some real leadership on the issue, Mr. President. /s  We're officially a rudderless nation now with that clown in the Oval Office.	20
1	I'll explain after I'm done stoning my wife for driving a car AND not covering her face.	20
1	&gt;A consensus report, developed by the state budget office and the legislature’s nonpartisan Fiscal Research Division, says the projected surplus is “predominately due to higher income tax payments and lower refunds from the 2014 tax year.”  North Carolina citizens are paying more income tax.	20
1	&gt;Liberty Counsel, which has offices in Virginia, Florida and Washington, D.C., regularly conducts lectures throughout the country on **the role of** Christianity in the founding of America.  Not being a Christian nation doesn't mean Christianity did not have a role.  We are not founded as a black nation, should all lectures on the role of black culture in different historical events be similarly outlawed as political?	20
1	So it doesn't cover the anti Christian stuff we put up with daily? Checkmate liberals.	20
1	The blue areas of North Carolina are doing well, the red areas are hurting. NC has great financial growth in Charlotte while the RTP area is becoming one of the biggest tech hotspots in the country. But taxes went up, school funding has been cut and teachers are leaving the state due to stagnant low wages. McCrory has been generally screwing over the same people who voted him in.  I've benefited from the NC economy though, so I can't really complain too much personally.	20
1	Who decides what is hate speech. He says to read the 1st amendment? Pretty sure in context the Patriots in the Revolutionary War according to the British Crown were straight hateful.	20
1	that's the point of the first amendment, it protects the crap that the people find distasteful, otherwise we wouldn't need it...	20
1	But you forget, Christians are mean and evil for not wanting to bake a cake, so it's ok to attack them.	20
1	Clearly not baking a cake for a gay wedding is just trying to restart the Crusades.	20
1	Hate speech is the only kind that needs protecting, therefore the Freedom of speech by definition is the protection of hate speech.   I might not like what you have to say, but I will die to protect your right to say what you want.  A loose quote from Voltaire.   What ever happened to that?  Oh yeah. Political Correctness.  Liberalism is a mental disorders.	20
1	As if it's a breeze on Reddit. Pfft.	20
1	This is like lightweight McCarthyism being deftly recycled by the left. I guess my rights end where another persons feelings begin.	20
1	Exactly, freedom of speech doesn't exist to protect benign tweets about what you ate for lunch, it's there to foster political ideas that differ from the groupthink.	20
1	Actually, it's quite easy.  Just ignore those folks.  Go to class.  Study hard.  Achieve things.  Learn stuff.  Surround yourself with folks who came here to learn.  You will look like a genius in comparison to the mutual admiration society.  Graduate with good grades and a useful degree that you earned by studying rather than sounding off in that pointless echo chamber.	20
1	what's was great about free speech was that you could say anything, then have a debate with a person about if what you said was right, but now it's just "YOU RACIST WHITE PRIVLEGE ASSHOLE"	20
1	I thought it was sort of the opposite, that the First Amendment protects us *from* the government. &gt; Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  To me, that sounds like the First Amendment is explicitly limiting the government from doing certain things, not limiting citizens from doing certain things towards the government.	20
1	I hoped we could have meaningful conversation....	20
1	I would, being prior military, I put my ass on the line four 4 years for this country.	20
1	No, you're wrong.  The 2nd amendment is about each individual.  That's what a militia is, untrained civilians protecting personal freedoms.  But, this day and age no one is taught anything about the founding of this nation and the reasons behind the struggle.	20
1	Oh it's glorious today. I'm in the UK and the Conservatives just won by a landslide in today's general election. Everyone is facebook is so pissed off and it's the most amazing thing.	20
1	So so very pleased at this.  The thought of Labour getting in sickened me to my very core.	20
1	That one spec of red in Scotland for Labour.   Labour is dead there. SNP isn't much better though.	20
1	Quite the results.  SNP gets just under five percent of the vote and 56 seats because it won Scotland, but UKIP gets more than double SNP's vote total and gets one seat.  But yes.  Liberals all over the United Kingdom are in mourning.  A solid achievement.	20
1	None of this matters.  The second you talk about stuff like this, the conversation gets shut down due to accusations of racism and white supremacy.  It's all a bunch of crap, of course.  The lack of a strong male role model in the average young, black male's life is one of the primary causes of all the problems the black community faces.	20
1	Oh God.  The left is going to *hate* this.  Stay tuned for the two owners to take all kinds of criticism from "liberals" for not being racist enough.	20
1	We can't solve this cultural issue from the outside.  We can offer ways out, school choice, etc., but any proposal that involves effort gets snubbed in favor of demands for handouts and "reparations".  Because all of this is 100% whitey's fault, of course. /s	20
1	They all must be a bunch of filthy racists. How dare they don't accept overly generous welfare, high immigration, a foreign religion imposing itself.. /s	20
1	UK Conservatives not quite like US Conservatives.	20
1	top lols.  If the results had gone the other way it'd be the top post in /r/worldnews right now	20
1	True, but they are at least more right wing than the opposition.  And they have cut overly generous welfare.	20
1	You'd think they would at least be posting about how Farage got barraged. Conservatives took his seat though, so Labour can 't claim it as a victory.	20
1	Disappointed that Nigel Farage lost in South Thanet, but overall pleased with the results.	20
1	I wouldn't count a lib dem vote as either center or right. But point taken.	20
1	Shame I never got to actually meet him. He was before my time.   We need a Reagan now more than ever.	20
1	This could never come from white owners, but it's a nice gesture from these guys. The message of "let's celebrate everybody" is a good one.	20
1	Also, can't forget that the two owners are Hispanic.  So, the "liberals" will call them "white Hispanics", just like they did with George Zimmerman...	20
1	I appreciate the gesture, but I do not identify by my race.  I am clearly a white guy, and I am not ashamed of that at all, but my background is not who I am: it is merely one of my various attributes, and I really don't want to be patronized for my race.  Certainly, I appreciate the owner's attempt to show respect to all races, but to be completely colorblind would be much better.	20
1	Especially considering they got 4 million votes - 2.5 million more than the SNP who got 56 seats.	20
1	The BBC poll almost completely accurately predicted the result........	20
1	Two dead terrorists is a bonus.  The only regrets she should feel would be for the one injured guard.	20
1	Innocent people die every day, why is it such a tragedy for liberals when really bad people die? (These terrorists, the death penalty for heinous criminals.)	20
1	Why should she have regrets that her would be murderers died instead?	20
1	Huge step forward for the UK.	20
1	only the MSM could possibly think that she ought to.	20
1	&gt; But apparently, according to the left, I'm wrong and a racist.  FTFY	20
1	Because we're a Constitutional Republic, and the founding fathers didn't want a handful of high population states dictating federal interests (even though we've kind of gotten there anyway). Each state has more weight this way, as they should.	20
1	It would seem we are all better off these two jihadis are dead. Anyone who drives 1,000 miles to massacre unarmed cartoonists has given up their right to live among us. Pam Geller did the US a service flushing out these vermin so they could be exterminated Texas style. Anyone who would be want to kill cartoonists would no doubt be happy massacring infidel school kids in the service of an angry, atavistic Allah. Best send these phony Prophet protectors to paradise sooner rather than later.	20
1	"Reporting the news" has become "shaping the news".	20
1	&gt;They will pretend that the Wolves, the Terrorists, are really just sheep that are wrongly being attacked and when attacked, it is because the Sheepdog/Conservatives started it.  Liberals refuse to admit that the "wolves" even exist. The notion that there are people out there willing to do them harm is so frightening and foreign to them that it just doesn't resonate. They will never admit the wolves are real until they are at their throat.	20
1	Look on the front page now and it's a piece about the greens who got 1 million votes and 1 seat, completely ignoring UKIP who got 4 million and 1 seat...	20
1	Because then the people in Kansas, North Dakota, etc truly will NOT matter to politicians.  The only reason any politician would consider those states is if it also happened to correlate to a benefit for a high population area like NY or LA. The electoral college is the only thing protecting Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, SD, etc from completely being ignored	20
1	Next from AP: Tigers are evil because they kill other animals.	20
1	Absolutely. More dead terrorists makes for a better life- just ask the girls rescued from Boko Haram.	20
1	Because both groups hate this country?	20
1	Because the left HATES Our Judeo-Christianity influence so much, that they will literally side with anti-American EVIL over their own fellow citizen if given the choice/when the rubber meets the road. the ones at the top know full well what they are doing, and know full well that their influence is destructive to the country, but helpful to their cause. But the ones at the "grass roots" level, i.e., our friends, family, coworkers, etc., are either mentally deranged or just purely ignorant or stupid in addition to being hateful.	20
1	When there is a constant media drumbeat saying that conservatives are evil, conservatives are racist, and conservatives are stupid, is it any wonder that conservative voters might not go public with their voting preferences?	20
1	I'm totally sick of swing states.  It's so much BS how your vote only matters if you happen to live in the handful of states where the turnout is really close.  Sometimes voting power in those states is on the order of thousands of times more powerful than in a safe state (as in a candidate would be perfectly happy about trading 1000 safe votes for just 1 more swing vote).    I get that it's the states that determines the president but it is totally robbing the people of having their voice be heard.  Fuck Florida and fuck Iowa.  Our national elections are an embarrassment.	20
1	US soldiers die every day. 2 terrorist fucks die and the left loses their minds.	20
1	I personally would rather have a kid raised by two loving gay parents than being shuffled around to potentially abusive foster homes.	20
1	"Free" health care sucks.	20
1	UKIP got 1/8th of the votes, but 1/650th of the seats.	20
1	There is no free lunch and there is no free healthcare.	20
1	For all their faults, the BBC still believes in journalism. The same can't be said for any media outlets in the US	20
1	Most predictions I saw were predicting a conservative victory, even here on reddit. In recent years Democrats haven't performed well in midterms at all.	20
1	There is nothing "radical" about these Moslems. Through its long and bloody history, Islam has declared nothing but mass conversion would satisfy the precepts of the Koran and its mindless votaries. This is no secret. Muslim leaders continuously claim that the only way to ensure global peace and mass Mohammadan morality is for all of mankind to become baleful followers of their phony prophet. Until and unless that happens, Islam will wage war endlessly against the West. The sooner we listen to what the pious Prophet protectors tell us, the sooner we can come to grips with this mental virus called Islam.	20
1	So butch lesbians are now in the privileged class?	20
1	Every time a jihadi dies, the worlds IQ takes a tiny  little rise	20
1	Democrats: never letting a good deed go unpunished.	20
1	Yep, and all night the Biased Broadcasting Corporation were insisting that UKIP had done terribly badly.  They got 4 times as many votes as the previous election, and became the leading opposition party in many areas abandoned by Labour (South Wales where they got 20% of the vote, North East England, and others).  They got nearly twice as many votes as the Liberal Democrats, who had previously had a number of seats in the Cabinet.  Under alternative voting systems the Greens wouldn't get many seats either - perhaps in London - but otherwise nothing. The main beneficiary would be UKIP, who lest we forget, WON the 2014 European Election.	20
1	Exactly. Every couple is different. There's no 'one-size-fits-all' scenario in which gay couples universally aren't good parents. Some same-sex couples are wonderful parents, and some are terrible parents - just like straight couples. People aren't defined solely by their sexuality.	20
1	An MSNBC employee is a raving lunatic? Who woulda thunk?	20
1	Can someone tell me what is going on with the left and their absurd views? This is becoming unreal now.. They're acting like blatant enemies of this country.	20
1	She considers herself equally as racist for taking advantage of her "privilege", right?	20
1	It'd be nice if someone in the government actually went to jail for breaking laws....	20
1	What do you expect? When there's a liberal media witch-hunt against a political party, where they paint them as racists and homophobes, people are going to turn against them.  I wish the media didn't have such a sway over political discourse.	20
1	Are pastors getting forced to marry homosexuals? Has that happened?	20
1	I'm not a big fan of Cameron but seeing all the reddit liberals crying has been great. Apparently to them democracy is only a good thing if you win.	20
1	While I think the idea that gay people think they claim discrimination to try and force a church to baptize their kid is wrong, this article makes the same bad argument i see in pretty much every discussion on why gay people shouldn't be allowed to adopt:  &gt; The most exhaustive studies have categorically proven that same-sex parenting is not equal to normal parenting  But that's not what we are comparing it to.  They are adopting kids who would otherwise likely be stuck in the foster care system.  When you can show me that gay parenting produces worse outcomes than that screwed up system, then we should talk about limiting gay adoptions.	20
1	Don't know if this has always been the case, but I have recently found the AP to be insufferable in their political correctness and social justice warrioring.	20
1	Am I really surprised of anything that most people from Massachusetts say anymore?	20
1	The best part is they seemed to be taking votes off labour, which was one of the reasons why the Tories gained. Perfect scenario, working class voters abandoning Labour in England at last.	20
1	What are the chances that a catholic couple could raise their child as a faithful catholic adhering to all church doctrines?   Probably zero as well.	20
1	Not only does the Obama administration ignore our immigration laws, but they also ignore court orders from a federal judge.	20
1	Actually, the media would attack Conservatives and Fox News for inciting violence.  Then the administration would form a special committee to talk about the need for a jobs program for violent extremist.	20
1	Once again, "liberalism" is pretty much based on complete falsehoods.  This guy is just spouting several of them.	20
1	There's no way they'll tell the firewimen it's their turn to cook. And does her lawyer ride in the firetruck with her or follow in his own car?	20
1	Thanks all. My curiosity in this was peaked when I wondered if the towel head camel jockey jihadists would get angry when just the allegation of insult was present.....	20
1	The uninsured are Americans just like the insured, except they don't have the right documents.	20
1	This is beyond stupid.	20
1	Small peek into leftist/progressive mentality. Fucking disgusting.	20
1	Obama: Putting everyone on Earth before Americans.	20
1	There are a lot of people on the earth that don't have the right documents. Are they all Americans?	20
1	And I assume she will work in a precinct FAR away from King Wilhelm.   How does the woman look at herself in the mirror? Does she know she is, and is being used as, a tool?   They want to do this to the military, too.   EVERYTHING the left touches turns to shit.	20
1	Illegals also dilute the labor pool, driving down wages for lower income Americans.    Illegal immigration is a net drain on the economy.  We should all be fighting against it.	20
1	He's not a psychiatrist.	20
1	It is an accurate description if one cares about such trivial things as the law.  Piss off with your "dehumanizing" bullshit.	20
1	So having immigration laws leads to genocide. You are an imbecile.	20
1	I love how they act like it's the cops that raise the black crime rate.	20
1	But you see the right stopped him from spending more so it is still not his fault.  /s	20
1	They'll still blame conservatives.  Ed Shultz asked the right if they were happy that they bankrupted Detroit.	20
1	.. Didn't Baltimore get like 2 billion in stimulus	20
1	If he were effective at representing his constituency, he would be able to have probably had some effect over several decades...	20
1	Explaining why he is the President today.	20
1	He doesn't accept responsibility for anything negative during his presidency so it makes sense he tells his voting base they're not responsible for their actions.  It must be great to be a liberal, you don't have to accept personal responsibility.	20
1	Yes, let's honor a drug-dealing career criminal and another thug who mistakenly thought he could beat up a cop.   That's some real leadership there, Mr. President. /s  Obama is a bigger joke every day. It stopped being funny a long time ago.	20
1	Remember when everyone freaked out after Glenn Beck said Obama was a racist?  Well, seeing as that Obama is the system, he's calling himself racist.  I guess Glenn was right...	20
1	Wow.   Obviously the labor unions there had nothing to do with forcing some of the largest companies in the world to move their manufacturing away from Detroit to make it cheaper for consumers around the world.	20
1	Well, if every other state had done the same thing, which is the *right* thing, mind you,  they wouldn't have anywhere else to go and everything would be fine. Damn capitalist sons of bitches.  #/s	20
1	Obama, Holder, etc are aiming towards a new segregation where American blacks can do whatever they want whenever they want.  I am certain that they would be perfectly happy to see a quota system put in place for criminal justice where the number of whites convicted dictates the maximum number of blacks that can be convicted.	20
1	Unbelievably, and as simple-minded as it is, that's the solution they're actually proposing.  "Libtards" is far too generous a name for people that profoundly stupid.	20
1	Cummings is a worthless POS who conspired with Lois Lerner to have the IRS attack conservative groups.	20
1	He's been in office for 19 years. If you can't get anything accomplished for the people you represent, then you are incompetent and should have been replaced a long time ago. Especially since that nineteen years includes a six year period where his party had complete control of both houses.  In all likelihood, he actually got plenty of what he wanted, which is why Baltimore is where it is now.	20
1	Translation: "Give us generous handouts in exchange for nothing or we're going to continue to commit crimes and whine about being punished for them.  We're not going to do a single thing to better our circumstances, it's everyone else's responsibility to do that *for* us."  &gt; When the majority of the U.S. is in jail.  Uh, it's less than 1%.  You're right, that is some grade-A stupid right there.	20
1	His criminal thug ass belongs in prison after the way he and Lois Lerner (also a criminal thug) strong-armed conservative groups.	20
1	a) Those two things are not mutually exclusive  b) If Trayvon hadn't have violently attacked Zimmerman he's still be happily burglarizing to this day.	20
1	&gt; In all likelihood, he actually got plenty of what he wanted, which is why Baltimore is where it is now.  Yup.	20
1	Actually in an assault case where you feel that your life is threatened you are justified in using lethal force. So the key part of the post you were responding to was "hadn't violently attacked Zimmerman".	20
1	After 19 years of representing the area, for better or for worse, the current state of Baltimore can be partially attributed to him. If anything happened in the city over the years, he likely played a role.	20
1	The fact that there hasn't been a Republican there since @ 1970 would indicate otherwise.  To a logical person.   Which his base is not.	20
1	&gt;I can understand why some people would see this as racist, but me personally as long as it isn't some sort of long term practice it's fine with me.   I'm genuinely curious if you believe that if they were to celebrate other races periodically if that would be perceived as racist?  What do you consider "long term practice"?	20
1	Baltimore is the 2nd most well-funded school district in the country. They get funding up the wazoo. The issue is beyond throwing money at things.	20
1	Doesn't surprise me. Remember when Thatcher died? They had a field day.	20
1	&gt;It's quite odd that there's a "#ToriesOut" movement now as opposed to two days ago--you know, the actual date that the Tories conceivably could have been voted out.  They probably stayed home assuming that the Tories *would* be voted out.  That's what their media was telling them.  (trying to find more good clips of the pundits' disbelief as the results were coming in)	20
1	The cowardice of the left is legendary.	20
1	Typical leftists.  Election results never actually represent what the people "really" want... when they lose of course.  See 2014, U.S.	20
1	doesn't matter to California, or Detroit, or Chicago. The longer the democrats are in power, and the more fucked up it gets, the more it's the republican's fault.	20
1	Remember all those riots when Obama was elected? Then all those big Conservative riots when he started abusing his power and shoving the ACA and everything else down our throats?   Yeah, me neither.	20
1	The fawning media coverage must be tough. I remember she made the Maxim Hot 100 one year. What type of acid laced crack were they smoking?	20
1	Someone at a Tea Party rally held up a sign about watering the tree of liberty (with the blood of tyrants) while legally displaying firearm, so yeah it's pretty much the same thing as rioting and destroying property. /s	20
1	Leftists are the same all over.	20
1	I love the sign whining about a 37% vote running their country now.  Gotta love the Left.  In the United States they piss and moan about a two party system, abroad they piss and moan about a multi-party system creating plurality vote victors.	20
1	That was fucking deplorable.	20
1	Well y'know... a gun and a sign about liberty is pretty triggering, which is the same as intent, which is the same as actually doing it...	20
1	Well, given that the population of Baltimore consists of 0.19% of the nation's population, that seems generous.	20
1	I didn't want to believe that....  [Darn it](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=thatcher%20death%20celebration%20parties)	20
1	You must have majored in Women's Studies.	20
1	the same type they were in college?	20
1	Every time I go to the grocery store, I see her on the cover of some magazine with a headline about how strong and brilliant and beautiful she (supposedly) is.  Yeah, I'm sure it's been a tough 6+ years being worshiped by the media and going on expensive vacations.	20
1	No, she's not hot.       What? Does she get some kind of handicap because she's black?	20
1	The irony is that when the Left won a much bigger victory in 2005 on only 35% of the vote, we didn't hear a word of complaint.  It's only undemocratic when we don't get the result they like.	20
1	Waiting for the riots and outrage, waiting for the rush to judgment, and the dangerous rhetoric in favor of these slain officers and the police "community" in general.	20
1	Heh, you're going to lose a lot of "liberals" with that last line.  They're actually at the point where [they are making that exact claim](http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/yes-all-white-people-are-racists-now-lets-do-something-about-it).	20
1	No one is saying that everyone does this. We have to recognize that some groups have problems in the minority though, and steps should be taken to help. For example just because most police officers are good doesn't mean we should ignore the bad ones. '  Also if this were to be posted on a liberal forum they would agree with it, and start accusing conservatives of doing x and y. It's important to remember while conservatives and liberals are different the groups we imagine each other as the extreme minority. We tend to forget how similar we really are.	20
1	I don't want to call your opinion wrong, but you did just lash out and say that the rest of us are fed by a hive mind. So there is a lot more evidence for global warming than you would think. At this point it's really hard to deny. I could argue that you are being fed by a different hive mind.  Also even if you don't believe in global warming you can see the problems with air pollution, water pollution, and trash. We are wasting our land and making people sick. That alone should be enough reason to want to fix things.	20
1	Thank you.  I was happy to see this meme here.  But the only 'liberals' who would disagree with any of the above are part of the tiny extremist fringe found in any political stripe.  Just like sensible conservatives shouldn't be judged by the actions of the neo nazis, we shouldn't paint liberals as the same as the left's extremists.	20
1	Aren't you grouping liberals together instead of seeing them as separate people with opinions? Exactly what your comment says?	20
1	I think we need less people imposing their political views on scientific research, but that's none of my business.	20
1	Exactly. Nothing is gained by holding up the extremists as some "enemy" to be crushed. There are many issues on which we can agree to, and for those we can't we can at least have a reasonable conversation without resorting to condescension or vitriol.	20
1	&gt; If a Mohammadan is asked about the proof for the soundness of his religion, he will flare up, get angry and spill the blood of whoever dares ask this question.  You're generalizing about 1.6 billion people here, including Muslims with whom I regularly discuss religious issues.  Take a step back and check your facts.	20
1	Relevant content in one image file: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/Q5RpOOe)	20
1	Right, and did you see right wing riots in 1997, 2001 or 2005?  Of course not.  Do you ever see them in America?  The difference between how the Tea Party behaves and how Occupy behaves is incredible.	20
1	That's funny, except the one on the bottom can't form complete thoughts yet. It doesn't have the notion of object permanence, let alone a grasp on its own existence. It also lacks a command of the the english language, so forming complete sentences is far beyond its purview.  That said, I like twisted comedy, so it still made me laugh ;)	20
1	According to The Liberal Narrative^^® , this is because all of the black Democrats in charge [are defacto white supremacists](http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/05/02/dayvon-love-baltimore-shows-the-sophistication-of-white-supremacy/).	20
1	Humans beget humans. The 'fetus' is human and will have a human life no matter how short.	20
1	Also the notable difference that the girls mom is almost certainly not going to kill her daughter, while the girl might abort the fetus.	20
1	The bitch needs to go	20
1	Tuskegee is not a 'black only' school. It's a traditionally black college and black students are the majority, but it's certainly not 'black only'.   But that's nitpicking the accuracy of the headline. The content is far more important, right?   I wonder if Michelle Antoinette Imelda Marcos Obama has *ever* really been discriminated against in her life based solely on the color of her skin?   Just more divisiveness that we've come to expect from the Obamas. Jan 20, 2017 can't come soon enough for me.	20
1	don't discriminate based on age.	20
1	&gt;the one on the bottom can't form complete thoughts yet. It doesn't have the notion of object permanence, let alone a grasp on its own existence. It also lacks a command of the the english language, so forming complete sentences is far beyond its purview.  The same is true if a 1 year old infant.  Checkmate, KingPickle.	20
1	The Queen complains that the Castle is drafty.	20
1	Turning students commencement speech into a sob story to make her feel better about herself. Nice.	20
1	Isn't that just par for the course with the Obamas? The comical narcissism never ends. *Everything* is about them, one way or another.	20
1	You must be a blast at parties.	20
1	It's simple: Chronic poor choices lead to both problems.	20
1	That's not really that different from the general population. which is about [42% obese or extremely obese](http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/Pages/overweight-obesity-statistics.aspx).	20
1	&gt;worse, you can't eat worse food than cheap chicken (hormones and antibiotics)  Wal-Mart frozen chicken breasts are 3.5 lbs for $6.99. And are you really claiming that McDonald's and other fast food is worse food than a chicken breast? Please.	20
1	This is exactly what I always argue when liberals try to defend these Muslim extremists for killing over a cartoon. I'm Jewish and my grandfather survived the Holocaust but you don't see me gunning down anti-Semites when they draw/march/say this crap.	20
1	I don't remember Jews shooting up a newspaper for horribly antisemetic cartoons.	20
1	Why would the Jew be wearing Nazi ensignia?	20
1	Arab/Soviet propaganda that the Jews (i.e. Israel) are the "new nazis".	20
1	No, no other group is behaving this way.  That's the damn point.	20
1	I think I can beat that.   $.89 Marinara Sauce (x2)  $1.49/2lb spagetti  $1.69 (X2) 1lb ground turkey   Make meatballs with the ground turkey, for spaghetti and meatballs that lasts for 10+ meals.   Plus since I'm in engineering, we prefer to eat the same thing, day in and day out.	20
1	With all due respect, Seymour Hersh himself is a liar.  He has prompted stories and narratives that are demonstrably false in the past, and therefore has no credibility.  This fact does not imply that Obama is not also a lying POS.	20
1	&gt;Healthy food is more expensive than cheap food  What a complete load of garbage.  Sure you can get some hot dogs for less than a dollar, but rice and beans are pennies a meal.  Obviously you can't live off that, but that trend continues.  Oatmeal is far cheaper than Frosted Flakes, for example.  If anything, it's the terrible stuff like TV dinners that are neither good nor cheap.  *Edit:* By cheap food, I'm assuming you mean nutritionally cheap or unhealthy	20
1	It's always easy to say that when you are not poor. And neither am I but I do consider myself lucky as well as persistent. There are people that will be poor by either a string of bad luck, subpar abilities and crashed confidence. I support those people..  Now of course there is this other side of the spectrum where people just don't care and live off benefits. I don't think that anyone likes those.	20
1	Clearly it's because we steal it from the other states. It has nothing to do with actually having better policies or anything.	20
1	This will be quickly discounted because of the source and repudiated by the reliable Huff Po  /s	20
1	Once you start approaching full-time (40 hours per week) even at minimum wage you stop qualifying for SNAP.	20
1	lol, just look at BDS and how safe they are at "Jewish Controlled" universities. They claim innocence and only show insolence.	20
1	Boycott, divestment, sanctions against Israeli or Jewish owned things	20
1	I find it so ironic that the left believes Muslims are so tolerant and Christians are such evil, ignorant, homophobes and use that as an excuse to perpetuate their religious hate speech while at the same time condemning people that criticise Islam. If you're going to tip your fedora and talk about how much you hate religion that's fine but don't turn around and say "Oh but these Muslims are just fine!".	20
1	Can he cite how many Christians and Jews that Geller has beheaded in the last month or two?	20
1	Not good enough by half. If racism is the huge scourge that leftists at bloomberg claim it is, then Mark Halperin should be fired immediately.	20
1	The left only pretends to be against racism.  The truth is they revel in it when the victim is someone who disagrees with their politics.  It's Rule 12 in Rules for Radicals:  Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.	20
1	If nobody watches the Simpsons anymore, is there any offense?	20
1	Utterly disgraceful, the fact that Fox News is propped up in /r/politics as the sacrificial lamb because of their conservative slant, but then be completely silent when MSNBC, a liberal leaning network, blatantly promotes these types of anchors. Journalism is truly dead, MSNBC pushes a downright liberal agenda but is NEVER questioned on reddit.	20
1	Well, if the Clinton Foundation is used as your example of a corporation, an illegal alien paying five cents sales tax on a pack of gum is likely paying more taxes than Clinton Inc.	20
1	I stand with Rand.	20
1	Millions of people watch the Simpsons, which is probably the most successful TV show of all time. Don't have a cow, man.	20
1	&gt; We should be upset at the extremists.  Which in the case of Muslims is a *significant* fucking percentage.	20
1	a statement made without evidence...and unfortunately, uninformed voters will hear it and believe it.	20
1	Since when are we supposed to follow the rules of religions we are not a part of?	20
1	You're arguing a point that was never made, with which there is no disagreement.   Who said 'every Muslim is violent?'	20
1	This seems tasteless no matter what side of the abortion debate you are on	20
1	With Bill around, I'm surprised she hired any female staffers at all.	20
1	The fact that Rand is threatening a filibuster basically proves just how absolutely detached Congress is from the wishes of the American people.   But wait! Surely the (R) leadership would never allow that! It's so well known the American people disapprove of the Patriot Act.........................  &gt;Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) has said that he favors a full reauthorization of the measures  MotherFUCKER. Seriously. These people need to be thrown out of office, with extreme prejudice.	20
1	I wonder how she'll make this the Republican's fault	20
1	The article states that the myth is propagated by not differentiating between pay and earnings.   I think what this article (and data) proves is that when the same standard is applied to measure the wage gap that supposedly proves sexism, you find that the same gap exists with those that want you to vote for them on the promises of fixing something the themselves can't fix on a smaller scale.   And when you consider then men tend to earn more because of longer hours, the wage gap isn't going to go away by empowering female leadership. Unless that leadership wants to somehow make women work more hours. Who wants to vote for that?	20
1	Lol using buzzfeed as a source.	20
1	&gt;implying there is a romantic relationship between Bill and Hillary	20
1	I'm just hoping that Bernie Sanders will run in the General Election as a 3rd party candidate and that one of these scandals will cause a bunch of her voters to vote for him.  Edit: can you run as a 3rd party nominee even if you ran and lost as a Democrat or Republican in the primaries?	20
1	Hillary could appear on national TV twisting the heads off a dozen cute puppies and America's animal lovers would declare her the candidate of canine compassion. There's something about being Democrat royalty that makes anything right with the Party's voters.	20
1	Benefitting from welfare vs dependent on welfare is 2 different things	20
1	The same place interracial marriage is.	20
1	Am I the only one that gets pissed off when sports news gets any non-Sports section coverage? I feel like it is a disservice to everything. Doping scandals and cheating in sports is frankly a non-issue to the world at large. Yes. I care. I care quite a bit, but in a totally different way from whether or not Yemen is being abused by Saudi Arabia or if Obama is going to screw an ally.   The same with celebrities.	20
1	I highly doubt any rational politician wants to kill welfare/benefits etc. Any conservative candidate realizes that benefits should be there for those who need them, but want to reform welfare to stop it from being a life long government dole.	20
1	This article is correct. Many liberals admit they are too emotionally unstable or too drug-addled to possess deadly weapons. These liberals then project that instability onto others. Yet, despite this fact, they still will keep a gun. Remember, emotionally unstable Gorge Zimmerman was a liberal Democrat who reportedly voted twice for Obama and he can't get shut of shooting or bring shot at. Our inner cities are awash in the blood of gun crime victims but they vote reliably for Democrats. These Democrats ban guns but keep their guns as do the heavily armed voters who keep electing the gun-banning Democrats. Democrats are indeed strange, mentally misshapened creatures.	20
1	Or even worse when politicians get involved in sports? Anyone remember when in the mid 2000's congress inserted themselves in the baseball steroids scandal?	20
1	Are you saying that the email scandal, Benghazi, and foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation are not 'real claims'?  It's pretty much impossible to believe Hillary is anything more than a liar while truthfully taking yourself seriously.	20
1	I'm not sure it's fair to place all this blame on Obama.  If you're concerned about the system, let it be known that outside of Rand Paul, not a single Republican nominee has said anything about reining in the NSA.	20
1	I'm curious:  Were you one of the people demanding to see Romney's tax returns after Harry Reid lied about him not paying them?	20
1	Good..this corrupt piece of garbage needs to be brought to justice.	20
1	Not for me, any one who is for any sort of gun control is no friend to me or conservative beliefs in my book.	20
1	Your body is going to be disappointed.	20
1	&gt;Ben Carson's all for banning Semiautomatics  So he's cool with full auto then?	20
1	Nixon resigned over 16 seconds of deleted audio, and you're defending Hillary -- who helped prosecute Nixon -- for deleting tens of thousands of critical emails she had already tried to hide from oversight?	20
1	Poor baby, it's all the fault of that meany Fox News station, and certainly has nothing to do with his policies over the last 6+ years.  I mean, that's not nearly enough time to accomplish anything when a TV channel is out to undermine you.  No one has exploited and harmed the poor more than Democrats.	20
1	Just another blatantly racist professor. Nothing to see here. Move on.  Sad that these are just about daily stories.   I love her Tweet:  "why is white america so reluctant to identify white college males as a problem population?"  Wow that's glaringly, hatefully racist. This woman has no business shaping young minds.   She hasn't started her job at Boston U. yet - let's hope Boston U. does the right thing here.	20
1	I kept waiting for the punchline.Horribly,though,it didn't appear.Every chance I get now upon encountering these drains on society I'm going to loudly tell them to shut up while I laugh in their faces.These morons need to be stood up to.	20
1	White people are only ~17% of the global population...	20
1	Anyone can be racist. Plus she looks white to me.	20
1	The gun didn't point itself.	20
1	Someday when the money runs out and these college attending children have to leave the schools and enter the working world, they'll realize just how dumb shit like 'microaggressions' are.    "I want to complain.  I'm a person of color and my coworkers are mostly white and our customers are mostly, if not all white, so I feel that's a microaggression against me."  "Sweetie, I don't know what a microaggression is, but there's the door.  Don't let it hit you on your racist ass on the way out."	20
1	So now we're redefining what words mean just so some groups can hate?  rac·ism ˈrāˌsizəm noun the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races. prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.  Can someone please point out where that applies to **only whites**?	20
1	Man, when's the last time a presidential candidate was being investigated by federal courts during her campaign?  If voters don't take a hint at this point our country is literally hopeless.	20
1	Reality is whatever I say it is. I am the decider. I alone make the call. There is no debate necessary, it's all settled. Like climate change. Deal with it.	20
1	But if a white person feels at all uncomfortable in a minority crowd, they're a horrible racist.  Talk about having it both ways.	20
1	Dictionaries were written by white male inferior overlord patriarchal suppressors inc., and therefore can be dismissed.  The New Wymynyns World Dyxnaery will allow for the correct usage of words as seen fit.	20
1	We can't let the truth get in the way of what I believe will truly transform America for the good.	20
1	Can't say "dictionary" without saying "dick". Patriarchy confirmed.	20
1	Yes Fox News has to change cause MSNBC and CNN are fine with their nonstop liberal pandering.	20
1	President Stompy Feet has had zero luck when it comes to persuading America to drop Fox News.	20
1	Only 618 more days.	20
1	You are correct, but it's been going on long before 2007 my friend.  This fire started burning in the 60s, and they are working hard to institutionalize their narrative.	20
1	Ah, so she's a militant and will not give up her fight.   Hear this liberal feminists, racialists, and all others!  I believe in the second amendment,  I practice it, and your beloved government has even trained me in how to be very proficient using it.  Bring your "militantism" to me, and your days will be over quickly...  In the end, this country will belong to strong, independent, responsible individuals.  Your perpetuation of victim-hood may very end up being more real than you project... real, fucking, dead, people.  Enjoy your government paycheck.  Bitch!	20
1	We protect the identities of accusers and minors, and it does nothing to stop fair trials from taking place. We should extend this protection to the accused as well. You cannot have "innocent until proven guilty" when the court of public opinion renders a verdict before the trial even begins.	20
1	Potential violation of the Constitution? Last I checked, the First Amendment also guaranteed freedom of the press.   Then again, the Constitution isn't relevant anymore. /s	20
1	I've said for years that the Left thrives on deconstructing the meaning of words and reframing reality in order to take the offense on any given issue.	20
1	Wait, which part of the article is untrue?	20
1	Until what? New World Order round 3?	20
1	&gt; "You pretty much have more than you'll ever use and your family will ever use."  Great.  I guess we should just let the liberal elites decide how much money you can earn and save regardless of your skills and education.	20
1	Isn't it about time for a ministry of Propaganda and Enlightenment.	20
1	That would be a whole lot easier than running a competent government. Obama could just kick back and watch TV and bask in the endless songs of praise for his peerless presidency. It is true he can already do that with most every cable news station. The one holdout vexes him like a fifth wife who won't take a proper beating.	20
1	That's modern Liberalism in a nutshell.  No specifics, but by golly they love subjective terms like "fair", and "equal" and "too much".  Ask them to define these terms and they refuse, because real American voters don't like actual demonstrative, specified taxation... even on the "rich".  The fact ridiculously wealthy Liberals can decry wealth for political gain, and moreover, the fact Americans can't recognize that cognitive dissonance is very disturbing.	20
1	It'll be interesting to see how the left reacts to this.  On one side you have a minority (Obama, not Chief Warren) and on the other side a woman.  Both are obviously victims, I guess we'll have to wait and see which one is the bigger victom	20
1	&gt; O'Neill said Obama's "clear subtext is that the little lady just doesn't know what she's talking about."  Hey, I finally agree with Obama on something.  Been a while.	20
1	NAACP just accused NOW of being racist.	20
1	And Soledad is a proxy for 'idiot'.	20
1	Surprised to see such government worship in /r/conservative	20
1	You didn't create that. Someone else made that happen.	20
1	Though I wouldn't go as far as to call them heroes, they do a tough job and deserve much respect for it.	20
1	It's popular to blame the Boomers for a lot in our society, but we've gone from a generation who actually fought for Civil and Equal Rights, to a generation that warned and fretted over code words, microaggressions, trigger warnings, and a false media narrative.	20
1	He comes across as someone with a heart, very genuine. So unusual in these days of serial slimy politicians.	20
1	Much like Obama's unsubstantiated claim the Fox News creates false bogeymen out of poor people?  Okay.	20
1	Pro tip: Enter the title into google and click the link.  It will get you around the paywall	20
1	Rand Paul 2016. Liberty FTW	20
1	Next thing you know, those conservatives will be praising fallen soldiers as well. Crazy times we live in.	20
1	Semantics. You know what is meant.	20
1	Police officers are agents of the government. I agree that they have a hard job, but you can't say that they're not part of the government.	20
1	&gt; If he doesn't win the nomination I may sit out or vote for a third party.  I wouldn't go that far. There are some other great candidates as well. But if it's another milquetoast RINO like Jeb Bush, Lindsey Graham, Christie, or Kasich, I would tend to agree.	20
1	CNN is a proxy for "Marxist, Race-baiting Indoctrination Network"	20
1	When I say "Thug" I mean a member of the criminal class who decides to steal from others in order to make a dollar and then physically harm those who protect their assets or themselves or others from the thugs way of life.   If you hear that and assume that I'm only speaking of black people you are a fucking racist.	20
1	Your point? Conservatives believe in limited and smaller government, regardless of the level of government. They also believe in accountability for government and their agents. Police should not be exempt from that.	20
1	Absolutely. However, the problem that the public is currently having with the police isn't the lack of police officers, it's their perceived lack of accountability. That's something, as a conservative, that I am very much interested in changing.	20
1	Why is the media trying so hard to convince us that all black people are thugs?  Most of them are certainly NOT.	20
1	I fear this. Paul, Cruz, and whoever else are going to split the conservative vote and a moderate will reap the benefits.	20
1	You libs can keep throwing out these attempts to control the language, but we won't be controlled. Don't tell me what one word is a "proxy" for another.  Thug means a violent criminal.  Nothing more nothing less.	20
1	I'm not sure why you're being downvoted for saying this here of all places. For the last two election the Republican candidates have been alright, but have never come close to having the political fire and charisma that Obama clearly had in spades. Not only is Cruz a proper conservative, he's also seriously good at this sort of thing. I reckon he'll get the nomination.	20
1	Could you refrain from saying Marxist please.  That's a trigger word for me and now I have to find a safe place.	20
1	That is so lame. Its a Hindi word that was bastardized by the British.	20
1	Yeah... sorry. Here's a safe place: /r/kittens	20
1	I think we all need to think real hard about this:  What do we do when the election inevitably comes down to Bush vs Clinton?  I feel like the Republican party takes our voted for granted.  They pay lip service to true conservative ideals, then install RINOs and expect us to vote for them.  Would they even notice if we boycotted the election in protest?  If we continue as things are, we'll never get a true conservative in the White House.	20
1	It's like when some one tried saying "there are chinks in your armor" was a racist term. Except there is no implications to race in that statement and just shows who the real racists are.	20
1	If I may, I'd like to rephrase your sentiments a little: "I believe that any conservative who doesn't have a problem with the current police situation is misinformed or has been misled."	20
1	When they lose elections like in the UK or the mid terms here, it so reminds me of the global warming nonsense.  They are never wrong.  There is always a myriad of excuses as to why their belief system was rejected.	20
1	If you really love the poor, you should create more of them.	20
1	Where do his kids go? Oh right, private school.	20
1	What is misleading about it?	20
1	Obama himself attended private school when he was a kid.  Clearly a "Do as a say, not as I do and did."	20
1	Oh, i see. It's not just *any* teenage boy. It's only teenage boys who know the secret password: "I'm not a teenage boy."       What a stark difference.	20
1	Whats crazy is that its considered racist to even say the "n-word" when talking about the use of the "n-word".  Instead we have to look retarded and say "n-word" or otherwise another black community will commit violence against itself.	20
1	People who want to perform a different gender identity while fully grasping that they are actually men or women, I understand.  However, people who believe that they are born in the wrong body are delusional.  Accommodating them merely indulges their delusion and promotes their illness.  Granting them protection under Title IX is not only absurd, it's mendacious and enabling.	20
1	&gt; But it was the threat of a loss of federal education dollars that provided the impetus for several school board members.  This is why skirting the 10th amendment should not be permitted.	20
1	Tell the all those people killed at the WTC in 2001 that radical Islam is a "made-up idea."	20
1	Sorry, I forgot once you say you're not the gender you are it means you automatically aren't that gender.	20
1	Between that and the wealthy ignoring illiteracy and racism by reading to their kids, I'm infuriated at wealthy people right now	20
1	What about parents that don't make a bunch of money but still sacrifice financially to send their kids to a private school?  Are they doing that to punish the poor, or could it be because awful liberal policies have made the public school system SO FUCKING BROKEN that anyone who gives a shit about their kids will do everything in their power to send them to the best possible school.  Give BO credit, he has his narrative and he's sticking to it, facts be damned.	20
1	And everyone who has been slaughtered in the name of "Allah"	20
1	None of that transforms a teenage boy into not a teenage boy.	20
1	Ugh, I am so sick of this fucking idiot.	20
1	Whatever, you are just an oppressive cis-scum heteronormative heterosexual who doesn't recognize that gender is a fluidity that cannot be identified nor captured in your traditional (and by traditional, I mean the last 20,000+ years of human existence fully acknowledging that men are not the same as women and we are all binary either a man or a woman) oppressive definitions.	20
1	Doesn't change what chromosomes you have	20
1	I'll just leave this here    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7TAAw3oQvg	20
1	The only reason transgenderism is not considered a mental illness is because of political correctness.   It's no different than body integrity identity disorder. Any logical psychiatrist agrees with this but you can't say it because it is career suicide.	20
1	&gt; Obama himself attended private school  Obama didn't, but Barry Soetoro did.	20
1	Some lefty windbag from some rag arguing that parents who read to their children, spend time with them, help them with homework, etc. - you know, just being an ordinary parent - is unfair because it gives their kids an advantage.   So, evidently, everybody has to be a shitty parent now, or the WHOLE GAME IS RIGGED!	20
1	There are both medical and psychological causes for gender identity disorders. It doesn't sound like a fun way to live - especially at high school age.   That doesn't mean that the girls want an unwanted wiener hanging around in the locker room, either. On the other hand, a teen suffering from a gender identity disorder would be uncomfortable in either locker room, and the teenage boys wouldn't want the kid in their locker room, either.   There's not always an easy answer to a complicated problem.	20
1	If he'd pass school vouchers, kids in poverty could go to private schools too.  But Obama wants to deny them that opportunity, while sending his own kids to private schools where they get nice lunches, unlike public schools, thanks to that whiny control freak he's married to.	20
1	Bathrooms are not divided by "gender" if you really insist on making "gender" and "sex" different things.	20
1	I don't want my little daughter changing her clothes in front a boy.  Period.     What about my rights?	20
1	I'm not as bothered by it.  What if my daughter doesn't want a boy in the room when she changes?  What about her rights?  I like how you want to coddle one group but tell the other to fuck off.	20
1	Because it makes him and his daughter uncomfortable. It's a woman's lock room. He is genitically a male. He's a male. Not a female.	20
1	Are you suggesting invading a region on pretense will have no repercussions?	20
1	Iraqi Muslims were killing each other long before we showed up. The only way Saddam maintained order in his country was by murdering tens of thousands of his own countrymen. Then we invaded and things were rough, but ISIS never appeared and starting fucking shit up until after Obama pulled our troops out, in case you don't remember.	20
1	No. They are not girls with male genitalia. You can be a guy and like makeup, dresses, tea parties, and whatever else is considered femine. Their DNA says they are males. Science says they are males.	20
1	Well I wouldn't say it was his fault directly. We can argue over the pretenses of which we chose to invade Iraq, but its evident that toppling secular (albeit bad people) governments in the middle-east hasn't done anything to help stabilize the region. Not only that, but its help lead to the current state of our country: large social divides on all issues, rights violations, and a deficit that is seemingly beyond payable.	20
1	That's nice. They can pretend they are a girl. But when it comes to bathrooms, official/government paperwork - they are a male. Their dna says they are a male. Just because they associate with that, doesn't change the facts. Just like someone who is an anorexic, doesn't change the fact they are skinny.	20
1	I wouldn't pick a school for that. Find the best program for your intended major. It's not  hard to ignore liberal asshats. Just don't out yourself to the professors.	20
1	It's worse than that. He's open to the idea of abolishing families altogether in the name of social justice and a "level playing field."  [Story here.](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/new-family-values/6437058)	20
1	I blame 9/11 on Clinton then.  Also, wouldn't the fault of ISIS land on the person that withdrew our troops and left that power vacuum?	20
1	Yes? That's the point. You don't want your kids to be distracted when they need to get an education, or get into trouble.	20
1	You can't infinity accommodate everyone who has a weird problem. Most people have issues of some kind or another. This doesn't mean that we should start letting males into girls locker rooms in school, that seriously violates the most basic sense of decency.	20
1	We have actually. When we left it was extremely rare for a U.S. Service member to die in Iraq. Considering today's technology, it is an extremely small about.	20
1	Why not? The Taliban was Reagan's fault.	20
1	Wasn't that after they had already attacked the embassies, though? I mean, we can blame Clinton for making an ineffective response, but not for Al Qaeda's intent and actions.	20
1	Obama had absolutely ZERO desire to renegotiate the status of forces agreement.  His 2008 campaign rhetoric and claims of successfully ending the war after the withdrawal are more than enough evidence to demonstrate that fact.  Differences of opinion on the validity of the Iraq invasion, and the conduct of the war are not only valid, but welcome.  However, to try to rewrite history and suggest Obama's precipitous withdrawal from Iraq was against his policy position is a blatant lie.  He wanted out, and his "failed" negotiation was the perfect means to accomplish that promise.	20
1	You feel alienated because you *are* alienated. Not because of your race, but because of the obvious contempt you display for your own country, your pompous entitled attitude, and the massive chip on your shoulder.	20
1	Her feelings are real, but they are not reality.	20
1	Reality show idea: Michelle Obama explains her oppression to a panel of human trafficking victims, WWII vets, victims of ISIS, and holocaust survivors.	20
1	Honestly I lost all respect for her when her husband was elected and because of that moment, [it was the first time she was proud to be an American](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYY73RO_egw). The FIRST time? Really? I'm sure glad someone who hates being an American so much that it took her husband getting elected president to be proud to call herself one, is occupying the White House.	20
1	Didn't Clinton maintain an anti-terrorism operation that was shut down by Bush in the pre 9/11 portion of Bush's term?  &gt;Also, wouldn't the fault of ISIS land on the person that withdrew our troops and left that power vacuum?  But then the question that arises is why did we send troops there to begin with?	20
1	It's not her race, it's that she ruined school lunches.	20
1	That damned League of Nations doomed us all!	20
1	I'm interested to know how many of the people upvoting you are doing so because of sarcasm, and how many are doing so because they do in fact place blame on Reagan for not following through, ala the not-so-veiled assertion of *Charlie Wilson's War*.	20
1	And Harry Truman lost Red China.   We didn't start the fire. It was always burning since the world's been turning.	20
1	This one comment from her perfectly illustrates how great civilizations fall when intellectual pursuit devolves into emotional howling.	20
1	I like it... I like it... but let's add girls from sex trafficking in Africa. Im sure those girls will really understand Mrs Obama's pain and be able to give her advice for how to deal with the sorrow.	20
1	Anyone else feel like she may be racist against herself. As in she thinks black people are inferior and need to be treated like children because they cant survive on their own?	20
1	It's not enough America twice elected her henpecked husband president. The enormous wealth, the countless servants, the fawning press, the glowing magazine cover stories, these things mean nothing. No, Michelle is dark and bitter and this reflects poorly on every US citizen. We have let our First Lady down. We are not good enough. We don't deserve Michelle or her harried husband. For the first time in my life I am ashamed of my country. We might as well turn the place over to foreigners.	20
1	I suppose the Civil Rights Act meant nothing? Just a "meh"	20
1	Obama was appointed by whites, majority of the votes for him were white. Who's racist?	20
1	And she wouldn't have a pair of Ivy League degrees on the wall or be taking several exotic vacations every year.	20
1	She's alienated because there are so little people who are as selfish, whiny, and ungrateful as herself	20
1	In all fairness, she does still have to walk around on her own two feet.  If we really were a colorblind society she would be carried like the Queen she is.	20
1	Agreed.  What likely explains many claims of "racism" is actually a "shitty attitude".	20
1	This is ridiculous. People need to not be so god damn sensitive, most of the time I feel like they are doing it because it is popular and it gives them attention.  There was a girl at my college who wanted the school to take down a rope swing because it was "triggering" and reminded her of a noose. It in no way had to classic noose knot and if she had that much of a problem with it she didn't have to walk the 1/4 mile into the woods to look at it.	20
1	Oh, to NEVER have to see her ugly mug or hear her nasty voice EVER again.	20
1	I hope you don't settle out of court with him. I'm so sick of people playing that damned race card.	20
1	That was just such a bad moment for America.  To have the First Lady say such a thoughtless, derogatory thing about the country she represents.  It said everything to me I needed to know about her, and by extension her husband.	20
1	"emotional howling" is my new favorite phrase in relation to liberal politics.  thank you good sir.	20
1	Someone should tell her...her husband is half white.  She is going to be very upset, I think.	20
1	The squandered opportunity that the Obamas had to push this country to the next level of colorblindness makes me incredibly sad.	20
1	Even more shocking news: her two daughters are one-fourth white.	20
1	I'm sure the Jews feel that way about the holocaust and WW2.  "Those US racist anti-Semites could have done so much more for us."  That's why Jews all over the US are burning the place down and rioting.  Because we didn't do enough for them, because the US only did the least they could, and nothing more.	20
1	Very well said. A little research can show Western interventions playing a major role in most of the destabilized regions of the Middle East dating back to the 40's and 50's. Anyone suggesting we aren't at least partially responsible for the situation has their head in the sand. Our GOVERNMENT is fucking up and suggesting it's only one party or the other is just willful ignorance.	20
1	Her and Barack are meant for each other. Her victim complex is over 9000.	20
1	Poor Michelle!  No wonder she feels alienated, she's surrounded by white people!	20
1	The kid was charged with obstruction of justice because the officer told to him to stop talking and he refused... holy shit.	20
1	Actually, if the article is correct, that county doesn't have any specific code against weapons being peacefully displayed on one's shirt.  Therefore, there is a case, and the school can be sued, and the county police as well.	20
1	What you meant to say was  &gt;...nice.	20
1	&gt;The officer, he told me to sit down and be quiet. I said, ‘No, I’m exercising my right to free speech.’ I said it calmly,” Marcum told the Associated Press in 2013.  Marcum wins.	20
1	Nothing bad was done to her.	20
1	Nice for the kid to stand up for himself.	20
1	If this isn't the definition of a frivolous lawsuit, I don't know what is.  I hope the judge sees this for what it is and tells her to grow up.	20
1	All liberals feel this way: you're not really black if you're not a democrat; you're not a woman if you oppose abortion; you're not really hispanic if you don't support illegals.	20
1	Refer to Tinker v Des Moines. This kid will probably win.	20
1	So, it's only OK to invoke Jesus if you're defending leftist ideas?	20
1	If the right were to take all their balls and just stop interviewing liberals on liberal shows, they would save themselves the trouble of being treated unfairly and shut down the liberal news media as a viable news outlet. At the same time, they can give national attention to commentators and news media that is friendly to our viewpoints and represent us accurately.  The presidential candidates should be searching for rising stars in right media among the bloggers and young reporters and use them as the moderators for all their debates.	20
1	What does ISIS have to do with PC? They execute people in the streets, don't think they're worried about hurting people's feelings	20
1	I think its because a few idiots have said that hating on ISIS is islamaphoic, but I don't know what Obama has to do with it.	20
1	This is what you'd call a gamergate moment, it's rather unethical for a media guy thats supposed to be objective reporting on issues that he himself is connected with, at least without disclosing it first.	20
1	That's what is called a "do you even know who I am?" Moment celebrities have	20
1	This guy is so far up the Clintons' ass he wears them as a hat.	20
1	Damn straight.  We will agree to ban Candy Crowley in exchange.	20
1	It's such a bs catch all charge.	20
1	This is the annoying type of feminism that demonized the traditional domestic housewife, even if it's her choice to take that path.  Real feminism should allow women to believe and do what they want, not necessarily fit into Hillary's "powerful woman who wears pantsuits" persona.	20
1	It's just as bad as when Resisting Arrest is the only charge. What arrest were they resisting if there were no other charges?!	20
1	This is why we have an outpouring of young college age liberals.Our schools are chock-full of liberal teachers regurgitating their crap to our young.	20
1	Unfortunately feminism has never been like that. They claim to simply want equality but the goal is to dehumanize men.	20
1	I appreciate that ISIS is poking out of the horse's butthole.  Very appropriate.	20
1	How is this guy taken seriously at all	20
1	And women who support traditional roles	20
1	&gt; Obama then incorrectly introduced the deputy crown prince and misnamed the founder of the kingdom.  As dumb as people think GWB is, he never would have made this mistake.  As for the rest of this article:  it doesn't matter if Obama is the smartest guy in the room when nobody wants to be in the same room as him.	20
1	Hypocrisy is rampant among elitists.	20
1	If you had said Sky or perhaps ~~RT~~ Deutsche Welle, I'd at least respect your opinion, even though I disagree with your premise, but BBC and Al Jazeera are horribly biased and socialist organizations. Al Jazeera has a US network, that barely moves the needle on ratings, and it is makes MSNBC look right-wing  by comparison.  The BBC is so badly mired in socialist tendencies there's discussion among Conservatives of cutting off the mandatory fees Brits have to pay to have the service.  It would literally be out of the frying pan and into the fire.  **Edit** RT was a really bad choice to make, thanks /u/13467946 for setting me straight	20
1	As a Gamergate supporter, I would even go as far to say this is worse.  Ethics matter no matter the situation but the truth of the matter is that video games are fundamentally a hobby.  Stephanopoulis (sp?) is part of a nationwide news organization (even if it is as laughable as ABC) screwing with an election that shapes the world.  Scary thought....  Edit: wow I used matter three times in one sentence	20
1	I remember when he was moderating one of the GOP primary debates last time around. He asked Mitt Romney a question regarding birth control that seemed to come out of nowhere. Shortly thereafter, Obama announced that the ACA would force insurers to pay for birth control, and then the media and the Democrats (but I repeat myself) started with the whole "Republican war on women" theme. In retrospect it seemed so... coordinated.	20
1	Same reason he opposes concealed carry in schools even though his daughters have 24/7 armed bodyguards.	20
1	Obama wasn't complaining about his kids. Obama was complaining about your kids. There's a difference you little people can't understand.	20
1	Debates should not have moderators, but only a time keeper.    Also, no stupid "twitter questions" or any other prompted idiocy.    Simply state the general topic (i.e. "economy") and the the debaters debate.	20
1	I wonder if he adds himself to the lottery winners?	20
1	Totally agree.    I'll never understand why republicans ever expose themselves to people with zero interest in facts, but only the liberal ideology.    While occasionally they can get in some slap downs, whoever controls the interview or debate always has the power to mold the outcome.  Just as you suggest, there should be no questions simply topics and they state their position.	20
1	OK,  I'll bite... So,  what's offensive about an NRA tshirt?	20
1	Don't you find it insane that being neutral used to be the job of the media?  Journalism is mostly dead.  You'd get better moderation from a high school debate club.	20
1	Easy: All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.	20
1	&gt;“Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon.” There is no defense. It’s irrational. It’s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions.  Rules for Radicals - Saul Alinsky (DNC Handbook)	20
1	&gt; I think as conservatives we can always say, "hey that was a good idea, but we were wrong. It didn't work."  Trickle down economics. The War on Drugs. Abstinence-only sex education.  It's nice in theory to say that "your side" is smart about things, but politicians and pundits never are.	20
1	That's how the media gets you though, they downplay anything like that or flat out ignore it, hell I didn't learn Staphaluffagus was in the Clinton admin until a few years ago and I'm 24 now. It makes sense considering how much water he carried with the "war on woman" schtick.   Hell, here's a [image showing just how ingrained the media is with the obama admin, you can't get any closer than marriage, wait there are a few siblings in there damn](http://truthorfictioncom.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WHITE-HOUSE-MEDIA1.jpg)	20
1	I really don't understand how people can honestly believe AL Jazeera isn't biased as hell. Just look at who owns them.	20
1	RT is Russian state media.	20
1	There IS NO hypocrisy here. None. Obama has been FORCED by Republicans to attend private schools in order to insulate them from logic.	20
1	I also might add that he accused the *Clinton Cash* author of being funded by the Koch brothers.  But ABC doesn't care, and neither does George.	20
1	Progressive think does not include progressives.	20
1	I think shut down Amtrak and let long-distance rail be handled by private companies.  But I wanted to know what conservatives think because they might suggest a solution I like better.	20
1	I truly thought this was an article from the /r/TheOnion.  I mean, seeing as only [71% of Americans can locate the Pacific ocean on a map](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/903062/posts?page=63) &amp; about the same number believe [the Bible is literally true](http://www.gallup.com/poll/148427/say-bible-literally.aspx), I think we can safely assume what many voters *feel* &amp; what's *fact* aren't necessarily directly linked.	20
1	The Government revoking the union's charter and selling Amtrak to the highest bidder.  Use the money for pension buyouts and convert the rest to 401k's.    The ultimate solution to Government bureaucracy is to outlaw Federal agency unions.  But that would stop flow of taxpayer money into Democrat pockets so the idea is dead on arrival.	20
1	I submitted an article about a month ago about that computer model that showed bias in political coverage.  Same thing. "Not directly related to politics"	20
1	That sub is a joke. Not surprising to hear the moderation is a joke too.	20
1	Look at the comment section the moderator claims the post was approved. It was posted six hours ago and the moderator made the comment an hour ago.  Around the same time this was posted here at r/conservative	20
1	Is anyone surprised by this?  Hillary is in massive trouble and the campaign has barely started.  Not to mention that /r/politics is nothing more than an echo chamber for the left and FUCK ANYONE ON THE RIGHT!!  They've been so focused on Hillary being the de facto 2016 candidate for years and never assumed it would be anyone else.	20
1	Must censor all dissenting voices.	20
1	I find it funny how they will down vote things that are positive about Rand Paul, even though I know they agree with his stance in the article.	20
1	I still do not get the anger here. Those folks are r/commies are known to suppress free speech	20
1	Wow.....I've managed to avoid /r/politics since I joined Reddit figuring it would be liberal......it's a freaking nightmare.  It reminds me of hanging out at a student union at a crappy small private liberal arts college.  The kind that demands $60K a year in tuition and then shits all over dead white males.	20
1	As a Texas resident, nothing would make me happier than to see Cruz destroy her.  Sadly, I feel like we've gone so very socially to the left that anyone so heavily religious doesn't have a chance.  My Facebook feed has jaded me on how much of the country is truly moderate to conservative anymore.	20
1	*"something something I don't always agree with Rand Paul but something something broken clock is right twice a day"*	20
1	[Link]( https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/culture-beaker/unbiased-computer-confirms-media-bias)	20
1	At this point social conservitism can wait. We need true fiscal conservatism first. Americans don't care if you can save their soul when they can't afford to lose another shift.   Fix the money, and then people might actually listen.	20
1	This poll honestly seems like a poor reflection on Fox News more than anything.  While the first statement is an opinion and everybody's entitled to theirs, the latter 2 statements are facts, both of which can be objectively shown to be false.	20
1	Interesting.  The program misses the contextual bias, bias of omission, picture choice, title choice. So for instance yahoo news during the 2008 election generally 4 to 6 positive articles with positive headlines on their main page at any given time. Every picture was one where he looked imposing, confident,  and presidential. I don't need to go into what nearly every article did to Republicans.	20
1	Sad to admit I go to /politics about twice a day. It's somewhat fun to see what they are currently raging about.   I've tried twice in the past to post articles there and was deleted almost instantly. I comment there every so often, and get downvoted to Hell.	20
1	think about it this way, what role does the federal government have in regards to social conservatism?  I would argue little, if any.  As such, don't even address it.	20
1	At a bare minimum, closer to being fiscally conservative.  This country bleeds money for a load of shit.	20
1	Isn't it a default sub too? What a joke.  Oh reddit...	20
1	The Republican presidential candidates appear to have the balls to acknowledge our foreign policy problems. For me personally that is a big issue.  I don't necessarily want some big war or anything, I just want someone who I feel makes America look stronger and someone you don't wanna mess with. I don't feel the current administration does that.  So ya I personally like the foreign policy of most of the Republican presidential candidates.	20
1	Probably.  But brigaders show up and break rule #2 all the time, so whatevskis?	20
1	I haven't unsubbed from it because I find it funny to read half the comments. Especially how all of them go crazy for Bernie Sanders.	20
1	better they go crazy for Bernie than Hilary, or do we want Hil?	20
1	I'm not quite sure which would be easier to beat, the socialist or the scandal machine.	20
1	well, to be fair the democrats these days often self identify with socialism...so uh? I'm lost lol.	20
1	Christie, hahaha. He's one of the few she could probably beat, him and Bush. No wonder we are so fuct.	20
1	You've nailed it.  It's the omission of information on one side and an exaggeration on the other.  Compare the coverage of Christie's "bridgegate" to that of Hillary's latest scandal (pick one).   Even when it is reported it's by of being negative regarding Conservatives.  "Hillary under attack by Republicans who claim she maintained her own server to skirt rules".   And they think they're fooling us. Pathetic.	20
1	They don't think or care if they fool us- just the large swaths of politically unaware people who they are fooling	20
1	Liberals: free speech for everyone except those who disagree.	20
1	Scandal machine. Obama beat her last time and we couldn't beat him. I imagine if anyone pulls close to Hillary, it'll be another nasty socialist that will win the general election.	20
1	Christie is a strong conservative?	20
1	In other depressing news [32% of Republican Primary voters believe that the Government is trying to take over Texas](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_National_51315.pdf).  Please, for the love of God, stop lending credibility to these insane conspiracy theories.	20
1	That's exactly what I've seen from liberal acquaintances.	20
1	Makes sense, they are a bunch liberals. Lie'ing is second nature to them.	20
1	Lol if anyone from Fox News did the same thing they'd be running that story day and night and vigorously masturbating.	20
1	No one hates free speech more than liberals.	20
1	Deportation for **illegal** immigrants is even a better way.	20
1	This should prove interesting to see what gets defined as "abusive".	20
1	If it weren't for Fox News you'd have a hard time even naming a right-leaning media source.	20
1	Wasn't the CEO involved in a huge scandal or something?  edit: [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/30jk0k/reddit_ceo_ellen_pao_just_lost_her_gender/)	20
1	No they gave it the boot along with /r/atheism because both were an embarrassment to Reddit.	20
1	The baby doesn't get to decide what to do with their body? The baby isn't "their body". It's a separate life living inside their body. They only have the right to chose whether to take care of the baby or not. They don't have the right to take the child's life.	20
1	Because they only matter when a democrat says the do.	20
1	Yeah, so why should people be able to abort a child if it cannot voice it's opinion? I mean if the child wants to live, why not let it live?   Stupid liberals imposing their standards by killing a child without waiting to hear their views.	20
1	If I were to bet, any dissenting opinion that goes against the hive mind.	20
1	I served with more than a few people who had their citizenship expedited because they joined the Army.  They were great soldiers and worked their asses off for the opportunity to become a citizen.  If someone wants to put on a uniform and work as hard as we did, they should be rewarded with citizenship.  This is just a cheap ploy to look hard on immigration.	20
1	I've said it before, reddit is one of the most censored sites on the internet.  There is no free speech here boys, but hey it's their site they can do whatever the hell they want.	20
1	If you don't consider a fetus a person (most libs don't) then abortion and murder are completely different.	20
1	No kidding. Go to /r/politics, search 'Rand Paul' and glance through the comments for each one. I am not exaggerating when I say the top comment is usually along the lines of "I don't always agree with him but..."  How many times do people have to say that until he becomes 'cool enough'?	20
1	As a conservative, male, Christian...	20
1	They might as well be the same subreddit to be honest. /r/Atheism is always shoving its nose in politics and /r/politics is always shoving its nose in religion.  It's also a joke that a sub about atheism got default status. It would be like having a sub about cat pictures being a default as opposed to /r/pics.	20
1	Shut up you cis scumlord. Your opinions don't matter because of your race, gender, and sexual identity	20
1	I think voat.co is where people are starting to migrate to	20
1	I wouldn't put existence and fashion on the same scale.	20
1	Key word: ILLEGAL immigrant.   I had a few Marines I served with, one from Germany, that all came through the LEGAL channels. And they had to serve and receive an honorable discharge to receive the preferential treatment.   The idea that you can swim the fucking river, show up at a recruiting station and they'll give you a uniform and automatic citizenship is fucking disgusting and simply weakens the US Military. Which, of course, is a liberal wet-dream, but that's a topic for another day.	20
1	This is beside the point.  They need to fix immigration.  You wouldn't need a path to citizenship through the military if congress would deal with the problems facing the current system.	20
1	By smoking weed you are not infringing on the rights of others, which is fine, legalize it.  By aborting a child the mother is taking the right to life away from a child.  I find that most pro-choicers can have widely different opinions as to when the right to life begins. Which I take as a good sign they are being terribly subjective.	20
1	Well, to play devil's advocate to your point, when a minor doesn't really 'get a say' in their own body until an older age, it's usually with the implicit assumption that the choices being made on their behalf are in the best interest of their long-term health. If a parent tried to make a decision that would intentionally harm (or much less kill) the child, the child would be put into CPS custody and the parent would no longer have that authority.	20
1	What about the adult black lives being ended by other blacks? Far outnumbering the amount ever lynched or killed by white racists and slave owners.	20
1	See, but whitey isn't at fault there.	20
1	There is an important distinction between baby and fetus. Fetuses can't feel pain before 26 weeks,( http://www.salon.com/2013/08/07/fetal_pain_is_a_lie_how_phony_science_took_over_the_abortion_debate/ ), definitely a misleading premise to the article and in your post.	20
1	In that logic it should be legal to kill people painlessly.	20
1	More like Ellen Mao am I right.	20
1	Ah Salon - the most reputable journalistic source for unbiased opinions.  Behold - I can look up biased articles on the internet that claim fetuses can feel pain at 8 weeks: http://www.lifenews.com/2015/05/12/expert-told-congress-unborn-babies-can-feel-pain-starting-at-8-weeks/  The fact of the matter is that if you are basing your opinions of abortion off of when a fetus can "feel pain" there will never be consensus. NO ONE knows the answer. It would be more logical to base your variable of decision off of something else.	20
1	God bless those jurors.	20
1	&gt; the one who bomb abortion clinics.  Is that a current characterization? Is that at all why the left sides with the muslims? No. The answer is no.	20
1	&gt; downvoting comments you disagree with.  Oh, did I downvote you...? no.    &gt; lets not pretend there haven't ever been violent christians, atheists, jews, etc in modern history        Oh, am I doing that...? no.	20
1	Well that is so very true it is not funny.	20
1	&gt; "Bill and Denise Richards, parents of the bombing's littlest victim, 8-year-old Martin, looked on stoically from the second row near the jury box. They were against the death penalty.:   woah...	20
1	They're completely separate issues.  Black lives matter is about exposing unjust treatment of black citizens by police officers.  Trying to discredit it by bringing up abortion is dumb because the movement itself doesn't endorse abortion in any way.  In fact everyone who ever tweeted #blacklivematter could be against abortion. I know that's incredibly unlikely but you have no way of knowing.	20
1	Minor correction - religious Jews won't go onto the Temple Mount, as one needs to be ritually pure to do so, which is impossible nowadays. Source: I'm a religious Jew.	20
1	/s, right?  When's the last time the KKK did anything newsworthy-- 30-40 years ago?	20
1	How does that make us better than ISIS who beheads journalists on live tv for the world to see as a message to those who won't convert?	20
1	Because life isn't defined as the ability to form cohesive thoughts.	20
1	I imagined they didn't want to see anymore lives lost.	20
1	You should probably elaborate.  I am pretty sure if Christians did do anything insanely extremist as Muslims did.  The media would report on it for  long while and instantaneously.  To prove what they want to be true.	20
1	Hmm.  Well, we had a trial, and we presented evidence, and he was found guilty, and now he's going to be put to death unless he decides to appeal the verdict.  Seems like he had a fair trial.  That's more than ISIS has ever given anyone else.  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.	20
1	I just read two days ago it was 8 weeks. And why is pain the only requisite to wether or not you kill something?   The premise to the article is perfectly fine.	20
1	Uh....name one respected and legitimately followed leftist who legitimately sides with those carrying out decapitations. Not those who look to find explanations behind said behavior. Someone who actually stands by the position that such actions are positive, good, or justifiable. Name *one*, and if you've *really* gotta dig that should be a hint this is full of shit  Edit: thats not even getting into the disingenuous representations of Jewish and Christian extremists....and conservatives wonder why people could possible view them as intolerant and uneducated	20
1	Or maybe they know that the process of putting this guy on death row and executing him with cost millions more than it would to jail him for the next ~60 years until he dies. He's already taken enough from Boston, he doesn't need to take their tax dollars for the insane death row legal fees.  We all wish that his death sentence was as simple as putting a piece of lead into his head (which is what he deserves), but it's actually very complicated and expensive.	20
1	Hell yeah. Scum should be shot, pretty damn simple.	20
1	There really isn't a KKK any more. There's a loose affiliation of various groups that call themselves that. I think it totals 3,000 people or so now. It's not the KKK at all - just in name only, and the last time they did anything violent was in the 1980's.   (insert fact that the real KKK were all Democrats here)	20
1	What? The main tv stations were all rationalizing the behavior of the terrorists in Texas.	20
1	I can't remember the KKK doing anything in my lifetime.	20
1	Journalists didn't deserve it. I don't agree with the pigs thing, but I think death penalty is correct.	20
1	We haven't used the guillotine in a while...just saying...	20
1	&gt; justifiable.  If there is a line between what you're talking about and however you would realistically characterize the TV position, it is so narrow as to be meaningless.	20
1	Describe to me in detail the TV position.	20
1	So the IRA is about Catholicism and not Irish nationalism?	20
1	You don't get NBC, CBS, ABC?	20
1	Try again.  &gt;The main tv stations were all rationalizing the behavior of the terrorists in Texas.	20
1	Catholicism and Irish nationalism are not mutually exclusive.	20
1	True but I don't think the main goal of the IRA was to evangelize Catholicism	20
1	I keep seeing the KKK mentioned, but they aren't motivated by religion, they're motivated by race.  If they were purely religious they wouldn't exclusively go after minorities.	20
1	Plus, the KKK was predominantly Democrats.  Like Senator Robert Byrd.	20
1	Irish republicanism was created by Protestants and became a Marxist movement.	20
1	For organizations like the IRA, it's a tribal marker.  Anyway, Irish republicanism has its origin among Protestants like Wolfe Tone and Marxists like James Connolly. It's not a religious thing.	20
1	The KKK was NOT about religion.  They hated all non-WASPs...black, Jewish, Catholic (Italian, Polish, Irish, Hispanic, whatever...), Asian, Native Americans.  It was race/ethnicity that was the motivator, not religion per se.	20
1	I'm not gonna lie, that's pretty fucked up	20
1	I didn't even realize it was today. I'm sure my wife would let me know when I wake up though.  Navy vet, 9 years here.  Edit: thanks for the gold!	20
1	Thank you for your service.	20
1	This was removed from r/politics.	20
1	I'm a teen and I not only approve this message, I live it. Bless every man and women who defended my freedom that I have today. If anyone asks "What freedom?" then let me respond to them by saying "What are you doing now?". Enough said.	20
1	Because these "liberals" like ABC are completely corrupt, and Steffy is a friend of the Clintons.  Just think of the amazing access ABC will have if she wins.	20
1	Because he donated to Democrats.	20
1	All those people without a home, and she still has $millions$.  Somehow I find your compassion inauthentic, Susan.  "Liberals" care sooo much about helping people, but only in selfish ways that minimize their own costs by using other people's money.	20
1	Don't interrupt the liberal circle jerk.	20
1	How many homeless ppl can she fit into her mansion? I guess we'll never find out because republicans are evil or something.	20
1	I just submitted the same article from a different site.  Let's see what happens	20
1	&gt; "We are compassionate liberals who believe in tolerance, acceptance, open-"   It's funny how self-delusional "liberals" are ... a lot of them are actually pretty much the opposite of all of that, plus racist.  Telling people they have to believe a certain way because of their skin color, indeed.	20
1	Is it removed yet?	20
1	Not yet.  I just got a precomposed multiparagraph response from someone defending the Clinton Foundation as non-partisan.	20
1	You can't expect them to actually **do** anything. Caring is enough in liberal land. Well, caring and voting in Marxists to redistribute the wealth of others.	20
1	Seriously? That's insane.	20
1	It was removed because Mediaite is known for re-hosting.  It's the way they kill something when they don't like the source.  And Mediaite got it directly from Geraldo's Facebook page.   I'm no fan of Geraldo, but he does have a point.  Anyone who thinks the Clinton Foundation is a non-profit is either a fool or a tool.	20
1	What homeless problem?  There is only a homeless problem when there is a Republican in the White House.	20
1	Its not what it is SUPPOSED to be that we demonize, it's what it becomes.	20
1	To be fair, the Clinton Foundation is a charity, not a campaign or PAC.  On the other hand, "charity" is a very generous term for the Clinton Foundation, which seems to exist solely to provide a slush fund for the Clinton family, and a semi-legal way for foreign groups to buy influence with the former Secretary of State.  As Iowahawk said on Twitter a few weeks ago: "The Ford Foundation exists to give away Ford's money. The Gates Foundation exists to give away Bill Gates' money. The Clinton Foundation exists to give the Clintons money."	20
1	It's removed now.	20
1	&gt; A Jewish family?  Um... *The Goldbergs?*	20
1	I do not consider /r/politics a valid sub - but I like setting them off..	20
1	Yeah, I got a notice saying it is "off topic".  Figures.	20
1	Liberal hypocrisy knows no limits when it comes to defending their own indefensible actions.	20
1	Oh there is no disputing that we have a huge infestation of uninformed idiot voters out there.  Two terms of obahmuh in the oval office is proof enough of that.	20
1	I had to unsubscribe from r/politics... I would get into the most ridiculous arguments daily.  Such a stressful sub.	20
1	I bet it's full of keyboard commandos, 101st chairborne rangers.	20
1	These are preseason numbers. Let's wait for the real games to start. It's going to take her incredible sophistry in order for her to get out from the crap she's gotten into in the past few years.   She better hope the republicans don't bring up the fact that she brokered a deal to let Saudi Arabia quietly crush a pro-democracy movement in exchange for the no-fly zone over Libya during the whole Arab Spring ordeal.	20
1	Gave me the chills.	20
1	What a lying jingoistic scumbag! An American president should supplicate, equivocate, and apologize. America is not the greatest country in the world--not by a long shot--so we need to stop acting like it. We should lead from behind, if at all, since we really don't lead the world in anything except obesity and stupidity. /s	20
1	When you have something intelligent to say maybe someone will listen to you.   Your previous comment had about as much to do the subject at hand as the price of tea in China.	20
1	It's like Santa Claus not believing in Santa Claus.	20
1	Ever noticed how small /r/liberal is? It's irrelevant when there's already /r/politics.	20
1	Like Salon and Huffpo aren't stacked with clickbait from the re-hosters.	20
1	From the linked CBS Baltimore article:  &gt; A gag order typically prevents attorneys and witnesses from publicly commenting on or releasing information about a particular case.  So, basically exactly what she's been doing loudly and publicly for a couple weeks now?   &gt; Attorneys for five of the six officers have not spoken publicly about the case since charges were filed.  So she's filing a 'gag order' for absolutely no reason at all. Why would that be?   Read that whole article: http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2015/05/15/prosecutor-in-freddie-gray-case-seeks-gag-order/  This woman is a real piece of work.	20
1	Complete disconnect from reality. The ideological goggles are so thick he thinks, like Dan Rather, that the New York Times is 'middle of the road.'	20
1	Would that be a...conservative estimate?  Enjoy the sub, folks!	20
1	My Favorite excerpt:  *In 2009, Princeton sociologists Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Radford demonstrated that poor, white Christians are underrepresented on elite college campuses. Leftists add insult to injury. A blue-collar white kid, who feels lost and friendless on the alien terrain of a university campus, a campus he has to leave immediately after class so he can get to his fulltime job at MacDonald's, must accept that he is a recipient of "white privilege" – if he wants to get good grades in mandatory classes on racism.*	20
1	The Sharptons: a family of scumbags.	20
1	In an essentially two party system where identity politics and populism are more influential than achievement and ability?   That's how the last guy did it.	20
1	For spraining. An ankle. Wow.	20
1	Anybody that points out Obama's failures as a president gets immediately dismissed as a racist. Obama cries racism so often, any mere attempt to debate him on issues is perceived as a racist attack. America basically has Al sharpton for a president.	20
1	Like father, like daughter.	20
1	As a conservative, I fully support people that want to identify as different genders. I believe their rights should allow them to do whatever they want and to identify as whatever they want, so long as it does not interfere with my rights	20
1	He has taught his family to take without giving very well.	20
1	Clearly that bump in the road that tripped her was racist.	20
1	So that is their plan to pay the $4M in back taxes daddy owes.	20
1	She is the Romney of the coming election season. She would only get the nomination because "she can win." The voters are going to half heartedly vote because she's not a Republican.	20
1	When I was a liability adjuster we used the "earth isn't flat" defense for these.	20
1	I was thinking parasites, but that works too.	20
1	Human garbage. Such entitlement to take from everyone and give to yourself. What a worldview.	20
1	*YAWN*  Is there anyone in this country that thought Snuffaluffagus was ever an objective 'journalist'?	20
1	&gt;“I sprained my ankle real bad lol,” she wrote in a post to Instagram after the Oct. 2 fall.  Yeah, seems like she's in loads of emotional and physical pain because of this horrible, debilitating accident. /s	20
1	So, he was a good fit at ABC.	20
1	Those shoes that the white man makes her wear.  Racist!  Should sue the shoe company too.	20
1	Ha!  No way is she going to pay his taxes.	20
1	I'm seeing this "no experience" argument more and more and I think it's a bad idea.  No one is going to buy that 8 years as first lady, then a senator from one of the most populous states, then Secretary of State leaves her inexperienced. Particularly when our candidate is going to have much less than that, in all likelihood.	20
1	Rotten apple doesn't fall far from the tree	20
1	I love her sentiment. But it's her sisters in arms she should direct this to.	20
1	Yeah, of all the reasons to rally against her, this is the worst.	20
1	The white lines painted on top of the black asphalt is a symbol of the systematic oppression which has forced Dominique to live a life of poverty and discrimination.  When you think about it, we kind of owe her that $5 mil for all the privation she's experienced.	20
1	Welcome to the new US military. Brought to you by SJWs and the Democrats that pander to them. Pray we don't get into any ACTUAL wars with another superpower before this shit gets fixed.	20
1	Probably the most irritating thing was attending a mandatory lecture on education from Bill Ayer.  I did like that when I tore apart him apart the next class, the professor agreed that Ayer's speech was pretty pointless.  I also remember discussing politics with the one professor I knew to be conservative, and he described how at department meetings the chair was passing out "Kerry" yard signs to everyone.  He said it was creepy and made him really uncomfortable when he refused the sign.	20
1	Thanks Republicans. Cause the one thing that Obama needs is more executive power, and these fools give it to him.	20
1	Oh yeah. Most of my professors were open about that and always pushed their political views. I even failed a paper I wrote because the professor didn't agree with my views. Still got an A in the class though haha	20
1	Everyone knows history has a liberal bias(especially when reported by George).  ABC has become as reliable as the National Enquirer.	20
1	I'm in high school and I see a huge liberal bias in pretty much all my classes. The information they teach isn't necessarily all liberal, but sometimes they will talk to us about their political views and how wrong conservatives are, which just disgusts me.	20
1	I'm in government right now and my gov teacher wanted to write a paper about why we shouldn't be in the Middle East and essentially throw Israel to the wolves. I wrote my paper exposing every hole in his flawed thinking.	20
1	I go to a Catholic school and in my religion class were doing a unit on Islam. My teacher kept telling us about how Islam is the most stereotyped and misunderstood religion and that we Americans treat them poorly (she's Irish) but then I brought up Benghazi and how Americans are persecuted. Even the liberal students in my class hate her though, so I guess that's something.	20
1	It's cause I live in New England	20
1	So far in two weeks this semester my statistics for engineers professor has said: fracking causes earthquakes, mentioned Obama At least 12 times, and presented an intro to statistics video the first day of class(30 mins long) talking about - "how we are improving welfare" and how that competitive rewards in kids art doesn't spawn creativity (lol if anyone doesn't see the flaw in that).  Computer networks professor thinks Al Gore invented the Internet - then proceeds to mention "global warming" in this class.   It's gonna be a long semester. Boston :(	20
1	but but but, catholic schools are all conservative right wing christian hate schools	20
1	I thought liberals didn't think pizza was healthy enough for us?	20
1	This same religion teacher also forced us to say "allahu akbar" when teaching how Muslims pray. The world religions class is literally just a mandatory liberal circlejerk.   My school is super pro-life,  even urging students to go to DC and protest, but they also are ridiculously liberal. I have no idea how that happens.	20
1	They still are. If a private citizen did what our government is doing, they'd be sharing a cell with Bernie Madoff.	20
1	This is what I really enjoyed about engineering classes - the professors don't have the time to push politics in class. It's just all thermo for an hour and half...	20
1	I would right an honest paper and title it All Lives Matter.	20
1	...So I got that going for me.	20
1	They know unborn babies are alive. In the back of their mind they know.  But theyre williing to do mental gymnastics in order to get to their ultimate goal.  The ultimate goal is free sex.	20
1	Maybe you shouldn't have raised two sons who were willing to kill innocent kids for no good reason.  After all, Allah does not love transgressors.	20
1	Clearly a very bright and articulate guy. Only about 35 y/o in those videos.	20
1	Cut them some some slack.  Their extortion racket where the victim pays for not being accused of racism isn't nearly as lucrative as it used to be.  They are evolving the con, branching out.  A man's gotta eat right?	20
1	SSI is such a disaster. And people are going to be pissed when it crashes because the population can't keep expanding exponentially. I'm going to be pissed. But it's a huge bubble that has to burst one day. I'd much rather be putting that money into a 401K or retirement account.	20
1	If I never paid taxes I could afford to go to Bali too. I need to become a Democrat.	20
1	How much of it all has to do with us? My brothers in the army and over in the Middle East right now. One of his biggest complaints is that the Iraqis aren't fighting for their home and abandoning their bases. How much of it is our responsibility and what point should they be expected to fight rather than having my brother and other troops put their asses on the line for them?	20
1	Not really free sex I think, more likely absence of responsibility. They can get laid with condoms and pills and yadda yadda, but if a mistake happens and they don't feel like being burdened with the miracle of life, just get rid of it so they can go back out and party.	20
1	They want a life of all pleasure and no responsibility.	20
1	She has learned from the best!	20
1	it's a human right to vacation in Bali.	20
1	These people... You can't trust them.	20
1	I meant celebrity left-wingers.	20
1	Just tell the engineering dept. that the pizza is for a gay wedding, then host a gay wedding every class.   Because distracting social issues have *everything* to do with engineering! /s  Soon you'll be up to your ass in pizza.	20
1	when SSI collapses, we'll have a lot more conservatives.	20
1	Either that, or the Libs will play the traditional "it's underfunded, if it only had *more* money thrown at it, it would survive!" card.	20
1	The last line makes no sense as the communists love forcing people to change.	20
1	hustling is the family business.	20
1	Not surprising. The liberals in charge of NYC have forced the FDNY to hire ppl that CAN'T fight fires for decades. That's why the FDNY throws so many firefighters at small fires, to make up for the deficiencies.	20
1	Unisex bathrooms are a way for people who are trans to use the bathroom without upsetting the people using the mens/womens room.  Since you are uncomfortable with trans people, you should support a unisex 3rd bathroom.  Lots of stores now have single-stall 'family' bathrooms, so that parents of can take their opposite sex child to the restroom - especially dads with daughters - more discreetly.    Basically the same thing.	20
1	This is an onion article... Right?	20
1	Only Democrats advocate loudly for ever increasing taxes on other people while dodging taxes themselves. See the Rev. Sharpton. See several members of Obama's cabinet. See Clinton Inc., the Foundation. See Warren Buffet. See Ted Kennedy who advocated his entire sordid life for the "death tax" but made sure the Kennedy estate was tax exempt. The list is long and includes only liberal Democrats.	20
1	&gt;Johnson would not address reports he took several days of medical leave for stress following the April 2 fire and several months’ medical leave after a fire in a six-story apartment building on Rockaway Parkway last July 4th weekend.  WTF. I don't care what job it is, if you're able to take months of leave without being missed, that means they don't need you.	20
1	If liberal policies insist on hiring unqualified people, wouldn't be easier for them to designate those people to simple cleaning chores in the firehouse.  Maybe even washing the trucks occasionally.    We would then have our first permanent disability case of a fire person being injured while washing a fire truck.	20
1	I am so fucking happy this idiot is getting the backlash he deserves. He should have been fired or at least limited to not covering anything political after his ties with Clinton and how much he helped him.	20
1	Welcome to DeBlasio's New York City.	20
1	This is the near end result of Liberalism. Along with cowardice comes corruption. You will eventually see the system fall apart in short time. Idocracy was a documentary from the future, not a work of fiction. Liberalism destroys everything it touches. It is an insidious, evil creation of wicked humans subscribed to by fools and idiots.	20
1	If every partisan Democrat who unabashedly supports Hillary for president resigned from the mainstream media, there would be no one left.	20
1	"Well I'm a firefighter, but I'm not *stupid*.  I mean, come on, that shit is *on fire*."	20
1	I thought Idiocy was about the rednecks, ghetto trash, and Mexicans populating faster than the smart people and eventually taking over.	20
1	&gt;Johnson, 41, a former city EMT who earned two medals on that job, was among 282 “priority hires” — applicants passed over in 1999 or 2000 as a result of discrimination, a federal judge ruled.  I think it's understandable to see why he was hired, he was apparently pretty good at being an EMT, and it seems like the drive to save life would make him a strong firefighting candidate. Clearly he wasn't cut out to put himself in harm's way, but to bash affirmative action because one of 282 people hired through affirmative action ended up not being a good firefighter seems unreasonable.	20
1	They voted in an unqualified president, 'nuff said.	20
1	Eventually, this is how gay marriage, abortions etc will be here	20
1	If a firefighter dies because a fellow firefighter's incompetence wasn't caught and weeded out in the selection process, that's a tragedy.  If a firefighter dies because the process is specifically set up to protect incompetence, that's a crime.  So I'll ask you, how many need to die before bashing affirmative action becomes reasonable?	20
1	like father, like daughter. Seems the whole family is nothing but corrupt con artists.	20
1	Isn't this pretty old news? The Obama administration was caught red-handed lying about the attack pretty much right away and yet continued lying about it until they finally found the good sense to shut up.   Who thinks that Obama didn't lie about Benghazi?	20
1	More or less that is what the liberals want.  Complete adherence to an ideology, as for Sweden, the people that have any morals or values should leave.  Leave that country to rot and decay, because inherent destruction is coming.  I feel bad for the innocents that will suffer because of it.	20
1	Did you read the article?  This is literally what the whole article is about.	20
1	It's a policy that's good in theory, poor in practice. Theoretically, Affirmative Action would ensure that Black/Hispanic/Asian/Female/whatever candidates who were well-qualified got hired instead of being passed over for under-qualified, "privileged" candidates. Practically, the exact opposite happens. Guys like Johnson aren't qualified, but are allowed to pad the stats while competent firefighters in his house (minorities included, per the article) are left holding the bag.	20
1	But the Assyrians, Egyptians, Caananites, also had the land long before the early Jews did.  After they conquered it, it belonged to the Babylonians, Macedonians, Roman Empire, Egyptians, Byzantines, Arabs, Crusaders, British, Palestinians, and finally the modern nation of Israel we know today.  So...who do you think should own this land?	20
1	When speaking of lying by the Obama admin, it is necessary to quantify, such as "Obama admin lied **again**" or "Obama admin lies **more**", or maybe "Obama admin lies **still**".  Otherwise it's tough to justify clicking the link, since it happens so often.	20
1	It would be far quicker to make a list of things this administration hasn't lied about.	20
1	Judicial Watch has more FOIA requests, but this material was just recently released, with the added detail that the DIA had told the admin about this being a planned attack, and also predicting what ISIS would do over the coming months including announcing a caliphate, and doing so accurately, while being ignored by the Obama admin.	20
1	It wouldn't be that simple. If the person getting these chores instead of the same job assignments as everyone else, and that person is anything other than a white male, (s)he (and others) would cry racism and accuse the bosses of foul play instead of associating the jobs assigned with the (lack of) job skills/competency.	20
1	This is from the linked piece on RightScoop. &gt;Thanks to Judicial Watch obtaining new memos, Fox News is now reporting that the Obama administration knew that Benghazi was being used as a hub for the transfer of lethal weapons to Syria back in 2012. Former CIA Deputy Director Mike Morell suggested to Bret Baier that the CIA wasn’t doing the transferring, but was watching someone else do it. http://therightscoop.com/new-judicial-watch-memos-reveal-obama-lies-about-benghazi/  Remember when that crazy Glenn Beck was spreading this ~~silly conspiracy theory~~ truth just after Benghazi happened?	20
1	Or when that crazy Glenn Beck was spouting off about an emerging Islamic Caliphate? Holy shit, what a fucking paranoid loon, amiriteguize??	20
1	Very progressive,  instead of fighting fires,  we should just understand thier position. Give them room to express themselves.	20
1	Unfortunately, it seems the US is following in this wake.  At this point, where is there for people with morals and values to go in this world?	20
1	Why did he even apply?	20
1	&gt;when I take the time to explain to you some s**t that is literally $82,000 below my pay grade?  Sounds to me like somebody's acting a little elitist.	20
1	Could the media stop calling it a "lie" and call it what it is, which is a "cover up to win an election"?	20
1	Give insurance away for "free" and watch the liberals line up for it. But adults realize it isn't free at all and now everybody who paid for insurance before are worse off now.	20
1	Yeah, cause it's so broken and not working now...	20
1	We still have a 1st amendment, something most places in the world don't have.  And, perhaps more importantly, we have a 2nd amendment.	20
1	Amazing how liberals always know how a thing is supposed to work, even though they have no actual experience with doing any work.	20
1	Wouldn't it be against her terms of employment to discuss her salary on the internet?  If she was white she would have been fired 5 minutes after her first tweet.	20
1	Ask a Jew about swedes reputation for tolerance.	20
1	When will ABC jump on this story?	20
1	I've been saying this for over a year whenever some tard claims there was no scandal.  They had assets who could have immediately assisted the consulate, but they were told to stand down because they didn't want to blow the cover on their dirty little Syrian proxy war. Hillary and Barack chose to cover their ass and let our men die.	20
1	Gundy is your typical black racist professor. The university system is filled full of them.	20
1	The Mainstream media will get right on this story . . . around December 2016.	20
1	Zomg but Iran contra was raygun and all you conservatives were fine with it then, even though most of you here weren't even born during that time, you guys Just hate black people cause they're black don't you  /librul	20
1	I bet saddams  wmds are in Syria too	20
1	The way people express themselves is a direct representation of their intelligence level. This is the attitude from someone with a supposed doctorate? I know liberal arts is ride with women's studies, African-American studies, or sociology, but maybe we should call them something else so as to not defame those with real degrees.	20
1	When they stop taking money from democronies	20
1	....if the Democrat loses.	20
1	I wish that liberals like this would realize their behavior does no good whatsoever to rectifying their perceived injustices.  All this kind of thing does is alienate people and stir up hatred.  It seems like the entire liberal narrative is about getting even for past events.  Real or imagined.	20
1	The first sentence is really all we need to hear.   &gt; Boston University, which has already condemned the racist Tweets of an incoming faculty member ...  She's not there, yet, Boston University. It would take nothing to tell her not to show up. It could take less time than it took me to post this.   What's it gonna be, BU?	20
1	I respectfully disagree.   It would have never taken 5 minutes. :-P	20
1	Duke professor dares to compare the success of Asians with the failure of the black community: Liberals call him racist and suspend him from his job.  Boston University professor says whites are a "population problem," openly mocks white rape victim: Liberals defend it.	20
1	They would, but if you recall correctly, the media had a huge hand in covering it up - to the point that Candy Crowley was doing it live during a presidential debate that she was 'moderating'.	20
1	If this is not treason, I do not know what is.	20
1	Sad thing is that this won't surface the news, and the brainwashed will continue to blame Bush for ISIS.	20
1	This woman needs to become the next Ward Churchill.	20
1	The situation in Egypt was laughable.  Obama supported overthrowing Mubarak, a US ally and a stabilizing force in the region (aka he kept the peace with Israel). The Muslim Brotherhood took over, Obama didn't say much. Then the Egyptian military takes over and throws the Muslim Brotherhood out. Obama then speaks out against the Egyptian military for skirting the democratic process (laughable not only because he made a pro-Muslim Brotherhood statement but also because he thought they did and in the future would adhere to any sort of Democratic process).   He opposed the friendly forces and/or supported the enemy all 3 times.   You cannot make this stuff up.	20
1	Reading about Tyron Woods final actions makes me furious.  Guy was a total badass and he bought a lot of time to get help for himself and the rest of the group but the Government left him out to dry.  And there were no consequences.	20
1	Ok here's a short breakdown.  Hillary testified a couple of years ago.  Rand Paul heard some reports that the annex that was attacked was used to move weapons to other countries. He asked Hillary about it who denied it.  Judicial Watch strikes again and wins a FOIA request stating that lethal weapons were in fact being shipped to Syrian rebels and that high level officials knew about. I don't know that Hillary is 100% confirmed as knowing about this but as Sec of State she of course did.   As far as what rebels were getting the weapons we don't know but it wouldn't surprise me if those dipshits were sending them to ISIS.	20
1	Identity politics is about division.  United we stand was liberals weakest moment in this country and they realized that.	20
1	I thought that was common knowledge	20
1	His moron readers will believe it.	20
1	Major differences:  Iran/Contra: Republican administration Benghazi: Democrat administration Iran/Contra: Plan benefited Islamic extremists in order to help anti-communists overthrow the totalitarian Sandanista regime Benghazi:  Plan benefited Islamic extremists by giving weapons to Islamic extremists to transfer to other Islamic extremists Iran/Contra:  Media flip out, Democrats cried impeachment Benghazi:  Treated as a right wing conspiracy theory	20
1	No, New York Times broke the story that they were in Iraq, but the Bush administration kept it a secret.	20
1	Israeli here, Libyan weapons haven't just been a problem in Syria. They were like 50% of what Hamas had in the latest summer war. US fucked up there too.	20
1	That's because /r/politics is actually /r/idiotliberalchildren.	20
1	What supposedly pissed Osama off though was our intervention in Iraq during the first Gulf War, which had little to do with Al-Qaeda.   He was simply pissed about us being in Saudi-Arabia.	20
1	How is this not top news everywhere?  This proves there was a stand down order given by Obama so that the full extent of our funding of ISIS in Syria will never come out.	20
1	"Not all muslims are bigoted religious zealot terrorists."  "All christian right wingers are bigoted religious zealot terrorists."  Liberal logic 101.	20
1	It's an investment into Clinton access. Just like the stupidly high salary NBC gives to Chelsea. The Clintons are America's scummy reality star royalty.	20
1	Because it doesn't fit the media narrative	20
1	Servants necessarily don't make eye contact with royalty. That is just rude. Little people naturally grovel before their betters. Rich and politically privileged people haven't time for the cries of commoners. The Clinton's don't hate poor people. The Clinton's are so insulated they just don't believe poor people exist.   The funny thing is these allegations are examples of poor treatment of like-minded liberals, fellow travelers loyal to the Foundation. If Clinton toadies are treated poorly, one can only imagine the rough usage reserved for "enemies" of Clinton Inc.	20
1	This is what I was figuring would come up sooner or later. Stephanoloulos gives money to the Clintons? So what? I figure he works for them anyway. Shouldn't they be paying him?  Nope, it's money funneled through him from the network to buy access to Hillary. *Now* it makes sense. I mean, we could read between the lines, but we didn't get the whole story until now.	20
1	More than Obama in his wildest dreams, the corrupt Clinton cabal can reward its friends and punish its enemies. Orwellian George owes all to his political masters, his abject loyalty is assured. ABC knows this and puts a price tag for that Clinton connection at $105 millions.	20
1	The fact that liberals are complaining about it makes me think it is probably a good thing.  Of course, the secrecy is completely intolerable, so anyone who votes against it because of that has my support, even if the bill had everything I agree with and nothing I disagree with.	20
1	Thomas Sowell has been saying the exact same things for decades, but when an old white guy says it, people lose their minds. I love Sowell, his research and writings are top-notch stuff. It's just much easier for the media to crucify an old white man. Sure, he probably could have used a bit more tact in his writings, but he's old-school where you didn't have to "pussy-foot" around every single victim group.	20
1	This argument is bogus anyway.  If I think a road project is too expensive but get outvoted and they take my tax dollars to build it anyway am I a hypocrite for driving on it?  Of course not.  It's just another strawman that people should always call out their accusers on.	20
1	I just don't understand why anyone would want to put this family back into power.	20
1	Doesn't the umbrella of "Obamacare" cover the regulations to ALL health insurance policies, (which would extend to the private insurance marketplace)?	20
1	well, it is they who decided to spend a million dollars getting elected to national office in order "to serve"  start by eating more Ramen noddles, getting room mates and begging on the corner  originally, public "service" was a sacrifice, a major expense, leaving home and family and business in order to "serve"  I have zero sympathy for the hypocrites	20
1	they are not full time residents of DC though. they (technically) live in their districts. they have a paid housing plan, the best healthcare in the nation, and a TON of perks that normal citizens dont.... being a congressman ISNT a vocation. if ANYTHING, they need to have a pay cut, and go down to part time.... (as in Congress is only in session at select times)	20
1	Exactly. To use another analogy, it's like condemning a Democrat for taking Bush-era tax cuts.	20
1	anyone surprised at this? How dare a black man go and try to mess up the free meal ticket and actually try to make us responsible for our own actions/words!!! SELL OUT!!!	20
1	So, you want to cut their pay so that the only people who can afford to be Congressmen are so wealthy they can take off a few years of work. Great plan.	20
1	The important thing is if a name causes you difficulty in a country, like making it difficult to say or spell your name, you should conform enough to mitigate that. You don't have to have a "white" name in America, but you should have a comprehensible one. Americans shouldn't have to give up their culture so we can have diversity for the sake of diversity.  So I would only agree with the quote if someone kept an incomprehensible name and refused to accept any societal difficulty that will come with it.	20
1	[His university did not defend him, it condemned him for speaking his mind](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/18/duke-university-condemns-jerry-hough-a-professor-f/): &gt;“The comments were noxious, offensive, and have no place in civil discourse,” said Duke Vice President for Public Affairs and Government Affairs Michael Schoenfeld. “Duke University has a deeply held commitment to inclusiveness grounded in respect for all, and we encourage our community to speak out when they feel that those ideals are challenged or undermined, as they were in this case.”	20
1	Asian cultural studies are not taught well in the US.  A lot of early Asian immigration was not self-selected.  Many were tricked or kidnapped into forced labor to build railways.  After being brought over, they were forced into de facto segregation being only allowed to live in ghettos called "Chinatowns".  Men were not allowed to bring family over.  Women were kidnapped and sold into prostitution.  Read about the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 for example - The practice continued through to 1965.  [Please don't go and claim that no other ethnicities were oppressed on initial arrival to this country](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/The_only_one_barred_out_cph.3b48680.jpg/800px-The_only_one_barred_out_cph.3b48680.jpg).	20
1	On 174K? Never mind the fact the many members of Congress get insanely rich while in office, often because they're shielded from insider trading laws.	20
1	If you don't think you can survive in DC on a Congressman's salary, please resign. You are not entitled to your seat, and I have no doubt that many businesses would be happy to put a former congressman on staff for an even higher salary.    Don't steal from your constituencies.	20
1	1.) Obama said that Al Qaeda no longer existed, he didn't "surrender" to them. 2.) they're different organizations. 3.) true.	20
1	From some article in another post about this subject:  "The second-poorest member of Congress continued to be Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.), who for decades has owed millions of dollars for legal bills incurred in the 1980s, when he was charged with accepting a bribe while sitting as a federal judge. As we noted last year, Hastings was acquitted, but later impeached and removed by the Senate before running for Congress in 1992. His level of debt has not changed since 2005."  And... that's why HE needs a raise.	20
1	Yeah, sadly this is 1000% predictable.   Racist™ this, Racist™ that ... I think Democrats have run out of plays. They need a new playbook.	20
1	This man has an education? has highly succeeded in life? isnt a Democrat? naa he aint black enough.	20
1	Living just outside of DC I can confirm that DC is crazy expensive. I can also confirm that with $174,000 you can live very comfortably.   Not to mention that these people are always going to functions. There are always events with free food going on in the House/Senate Office buildings.	20
1	Let's say that I had a job, and my peers - when polled - gave me a [19% approval rating](http://www.gallup.com/poll/183128/five-months-gop-congress-approval-remains-low.aspx).   Do you think my boss would give me a raise, or show me the door?	20
1	Frankly I don't think they should be living in DC. They need to live and work in their district and only return to DC for votes.	20
1	DWS says an action is "heartless". /irony	20
1	Your peers would normally be those working with you, not everyone outside the company.  And, of course, that poll is based on Congress as a whole, not individual Congressmen. People don't think that their representative is the problem.	20
1	The same idiot that compares republican politicians with wife beaters. She's so classy.	20
1	Yes. The 2014 mid-terms.	20
1	Regardless of him becoming the candidate or whether or not you support him, watching them struggle over a black man who doesn't fit their political narrative is going to be amazing to watch.	20
1	not to split hairs here.... but if the federal govt cannot build a secure website to implement obamacare..... do you REALLY think it can create a network that allows our elected officials to vote from their hometowns and NOT be hacked?	20
1	Dear Congress,  You can have a raise only when you can be held to the same rules and standards as other folks. Currently you enjoy the ability to conduct insider trading without fear of prosecution. If you can't take 174,000 and turn it into a few million using that loophole you are incompetent and show proof that a 5 year old with a lemonade stand has a better understanding of how the economy works.   PS: Would love to force staff of (D) congress members into a union that they must deal with.   Signed:   Working to pay your Salary.	20
1	I hate that argument, it makes no sense and carries no weight whatsoever.	20
1	They have votes almost every day. Last week they had 40. And you think all Congressmen do is show up and vote?	20
1	Having citizenship actually mean anything is "heartless".  Enforcing the law is "heartless". /s  Just another example of ditzy "liberals" following their *feelings*.	20
1	That's a true assertion - if their strategy is to let ISIS grow out of control.	20
1	We're a Representative Republic, not a Democracy. I don't want a true democracy, and neither do you.	20
1	Tell me about it. I was going to vote for Cain. His 9-9-9 plan was great! Then the women came and got him to drop out.....and nothing. You never heard another word about the allegations. A real hit piece.	20
1	Well then, burn the bitch down! Looting for fun and profit is as American as the CPUSA. Was there a bonus for setting fire to a business? Extra money for shooting a cop? Was this protest pay taxpayer money from the community organizer Obama?	20
1	I'm sure all the guns used were perfectly legal too. Am I allowed to call them "thugs" or is that racist?	20
1	That's genuinely hilarious. What a sack of shit	20
1	That'll never happen. *#DemocratPrivilege*	20
1	Hilarious and sad at the same time.	20
1	Nope just drove by the CVS near there and it's still not burnt down...	20
1	I thought that ACORN didn't exist anymore.  Edit:  then I read the blog.	20
1	The problem is when you're honest about the things which hold them back, such as welfare dependency, affirmative action, gangsta rap culture, or planned parenthood targeting them for population reduction, you get labeled a racist.	20
1	Charge them with RICO.	20
1	I hope they never see a dime of the money.	20
1	Imagine for a second a conservative organization, like the tea party, paying people to demonstrate against something or attend an event.  As soon as the facts came to light, it would be the lead story in all the lying liberal media outlets.  But not a chance that this story will ever see the light of day.	20
1	When you vote for people based on an ideology, rather than actual accomplishments to better the country, you get people like hillary and obama elected.  And the idiocy continues after they are elected.  When asked why things are so bad after they are in office, the useful idiots blame everyone and everything other than the actual bad policies of their beloved candidate.	20
1	&gt;“If you’re so unproductive that you can’t pay a little bit more, than maybe you don’t belong in a modern economy.”  Liberal douchebaggery at its finest.	20
1	And these inside-the-beltway RINOs and their idiot consultants like Rove constantly worried about trying to stay on the media's good side, afraid to take a principled stand on any issues. What a failed strategy that has been. The media hates conservatives and the American people hate the media. Stop sucking up to them.	20
1	Or in the case of Obama, lie and say that things are just fine. Lately the left has been saying things like the unemployment rate is lower and the economy is much stronger. But they stop counting those who stop looking for work, and the economy has only slightly improved.   Contrast that with Canada, who thrived through the recession.	20
1	The left is depending on gay marriage to keep them relevant.	20
1	She's right. The site is a private company and they have every right to censor what they want.	20
1	I don't know why people think that Reddit has *ever* been some bastion of free speech.  Hell, censorship is built into its foundation in the form of upvotes/downvotes.	20
1	They always same the same fucking thing "If we don't do X thing by X year then X city will be under X feet of water." They have been predicting it for years. I remember some predictions saying Manhattan would be under 3 feet of water by *2013*.	20
1	Ppfffttttt. Are you serious?  You don't see a conflict with her taking billions (with a B) to her foundation from foreign governments while she was Secretary of State? She should be in jail.	20
1	There are about as many conservative views on Reddit as there are viewers for MSNBC.	20
1	Liberals have employed this policy since the dawn. Use social issues as a veil in order to mask fiscal responsibilties. If you were to ask an average American, what's more important to you as a voter, gay marriage, or the unemployment rate? Disarming the police? Or lowering taxes? The MSM spoon feeds the masses this incompetent drivel, forgetting to mention our stagnant economy. It really is disheartening how REAL issues take a back seat all the time.	20
1	Straw man + "What difference does it make" .... are you Hil?	20
1	It's good she admits how biased it really is.  The plaform lends itself well to censorship of unpopular opinions, and thereby increasing bias.	20
1	Lmao fantastic job, kudos man	20
1	Reddit in fact was originally heralded as a platform of free speech.  That's why sub's like r jailbait were allowed to exist.  Also, per rediquette upvotes are supposed to be for comments that add to discussion, not comments you agree with. Alas, once reddit started banning sub's that were controversial, free speech was no longer a value.	20
1	No it's a marketer's wet dream with enormous astroturfing potential.	20
1	You are doing God's work.	20
1	Go Rand!  I wonder what the odds are of this passing...	20
1	It sure isn't.  Only liberal views allowed.	20
1	CHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO}  CHOOOO CHOOO CHOOOOO	20
1	I guess we're only an hour in so far, but the discussion is still very relevant. It looks like he's got a whole binder of stuff to talk about though. Wonder how long he'll last.	20
1	It is primarily dominated by paid shills for causes like Climate Change or Jew Bashing.	20
1	Reminds me of /r/Colorado banning anybody that didn't support Mark Udall (D) in the last election.	20
1	Hopefully enough congressmen jump-in and help that a real change can be made. The patriot act is anything but patriotic.	20
1	THOSE DAMNED OBSTRUCTIONIST REPUBLICANS!	20
1	Not sure, but a few times now Ron Wyden has taken about 15 minutes to "ask him a question". Both times, the question was just a speech followed by "what do you think about this?". They're really just passing the mic back and forth, which I'm sure Rand appreciates.	20
1	I hope and pray that the Democrats are forced to nominate Joe Biden for president.	20
1	I hope this boosts his approval ratings.  Also, you know this is a good senator when the /r/politics counterpart of this post is not only on the front page but also has more upvotes than the one on /r/conservative.	20
1	At this point, he may be the least objectionable candidate they have to offer.	20
1	How could any sane voter R or D be against this?	20
1	Just another of far too many examples of gay-rights and same-sex marriage advocates shooting themselves in the foot when given a chance.   It's sad, really.   Suing young 20-something photographers and little old ladies that bake cakes out of business by abusing our court system is NOT a way to win over hearts and minds.   Faking a 'study' is NOT the way to win over hearts and minds.   I'm all for same-sex marriage - but these kinds of liars and bullies do a huge disservice to the movement.	20
1	You've got balls the size of Grapefruits there ms8.  These leftists have no sense of humor and they are powerful and they are very vindictive.  Hilarious though.	20
1	It's really hard to use reddit a lot, and constantly see the circlejerking around liberal ideas. I'll see 2 identical stories, one controversial about Obama, one controversial about Walker, or Jeb Bush or something. The one bashing the right wings is front page material. The one bashing Obama, 13 upvotes...	20
1	&gt; "Do you wish to have the government redefine Marriage an institution that pre-dates Western Civilization because a political group in this country doesn't like Civil Unions? Civil Unions which can (like in California) provide 100% equal protection and benefits to the couples." Logical argument about traditional definition or marriage.  Currently civil unions don't provide what a marriage license does. It's not illogical at all to want the same benefits.	20
1	Propaganda. Even the name itself "the patriot act" oozes Goebbels.	20
1	Rand Paul is going to be second coming of Calvin Coolidge!  He's going to be a wrecking ball of a veto machine.  I don't agree with every policy of his, but I appreciate someone that dedicated to liberty.	20
1	a true defender of liberty.	20
1	Went to a couple of the large news webpages just now - Unfortunately he doesn't seem to be getting much coverage...	20
1	&gt; Support for gay "marriage" is on the decline...  Where did you hear that?  http://www.gallup.com/poll/183272/record-high-americans-support-sex-marriage.aspx  Edit: Why would someone downvote me for pointing out that public support is not declining using an actual source?	20
1	That's the kind of bipartisanship that has been missing for far too long, awesome.	20
1	I really hope this man wins!	20
1	It was ruled by police and the school investigation that she did not have a case. She then did her demonstration making it a hostile environment for the person she accused, and got fame and benefits (such as grades) from said project. This is a stunt that demeans the cause she supposedly was demonstrating for, and based on all current information she seems to be a liar about things.	20
1	To be fair, there are three in the top five, now.   With that said, it's amazing that if Bernie was doing this it would be upvoted to oblivion and that since it's ~~Ron~~ Rand, according to the Redditors there it's "Grandstanding".  **EDIT: D'oah.**	20
1	His entire Presidency has been a dereliction of duty.	20
1	&gt; leftists have no sense of humor  Leftist here, I find this pretty damn funny.	20
1	Translation: 9 potential republican candidates and Jeb Bush	20
1	**[Ted Cruz](http://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/princetonperiodicals?a=d&amp;d=Princetonian19920408-01.2.12&amp;srpos=2&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-Ted+Cruz------)**	20
1	No, that only applies if it's like a trademarked company. A public official such as Biden doesn't automatically have ownership of their domain.  The only stipulation would be if I was pretending to be him (identify fraud) which obviously is not the case.	20
1	Walker, Cruz, Rubio, Paul, Bush (because you have to), you really don't need any others...   Santorum? Huckabee? How many times do they need to lose? They can't even beat Romney or McCain, how are they going to beat Hillary? They certainly have done **nothing** to make them more appealing.  Fiorina, Carson, Trump? Not trying to disrespect anyone, but let's get serious.  Perry, Graham, Christie? Not necessary.   Pataki and Jindal? Are they even running?   Walker, Cruz, Rubio, Paul, and (forced) Bush. Just cut it to 5 solid candidates, look at that.	20
1	Well duh, because bashing Obama makes you a bigot racist, don't ya know? **/s**   But seriously - that is the consensus of 95% of reddit.	20
1	Reading through the Bernie AMA was interesting. A lot of comments claimed that Bernie was more "sincere" than Obama was as a candidate; ironically, I doubt those same individuals thought that Obama was insincere at the time. A lot of it is just feel-good nonsense for that kind of people.	20
1	Go, Rand, go.	20
1	It sounds like something that Cheney jokingly suggested and bush decided to see how far they could push it	20
1	One problem with r politics is that if you post an article (and copy and paste the headline perfectly) and then the editors or writers change the name of the article, and then the mods check that link, they are going to remove your article for breaking their "no headlines that aren't direct quotes" rule.  It also doesn't matter if the OP is the editor/writer, and changed the headline themselves, they're STILL going to use the "not quoted" rule to pull your post.  Headlines change, that rule is unsustainable, but for now it's just incredibly convenient.	20
1	So true. They were looking for any reason to not side with him even though everyone agrees with what he's standing against. Hilarious.	20
1	Of course not. Get that female Texas senator up there filibustering for a couple hours over an abortion bill and it's front page news. Rand Paul filibustering over something important? Crickets.	20
1	&gt; Headlines change, that rule is unsustainable, but for now it's just incredibly convenient.  I just like to remind them how incredibly stupid they are because the URL often contains the original headline.	20
1	The funniest (saddest?) part is that ending NSA surveillance *is* a liberal idea.  But the /r/politics mods are so caught up in the "Republicans are evil/Democrats are good" tribalism that they reflexively oppose Republicans even when those Republicans are advocating for things they support.	20
1	He is what democrats think ALL republicans are like	20
1	The MSM *loves* to give advice to conservatives. I assume it is either wishful thinking to try to get conservatives to become liberals, or simply bad advice to try to sabotage them.	20
1	Hillary isn't running for the office as much as she is standing still hoping entitlement will sweep her in. The media has been left doing her campaigning. This includes choosing her opponent. The only thing that would turn voters off more than Hillary is a Hillary/Bush rematch reeking of the 1990s.	20
1	Let's not become like the left. This seems petty and a much as I don't like fauxhaunus the explanation makes sense to me.	20
1	I noticed a recent uptick in Jeb articles on liberal/"progressive" subreddits. They acknowledge him much more than we do.   I guess even though we have 15 diverse candidates, they want to insist on the no choice model. They call themselves democrats, but they forgot how to practice democracy.	20
1	Perfect president and vice president team - Cruz and Paul or vice versa. That would be a great morning in America.	20
1	McConnell is awful. He is literally Harry Reid with a turkey neck.	20
1	If it makes you feel any better, those of us that are *really* on the left don't really like the media's narrative about the inevitability of Clinton being the candidate, either.	20
1	I'm in the same boat as tinteoj. I'm fairly liberal, but don't want Clinton 2.0 just as much as I don't want Bush 3.0.   The only conservative I would happily vote for is Jon Huntsman.	20
1	Just like Romney last time.	20
1	I don't think he's a woman-hating, gun-shooting Nazi.	20
1	She's basically limiting her exposure until closer to the general election, which is smart.	20
1	When you own the major media outlets and are guaranteed unabashed loyalty from most media personalities, you can coast. Rules for regular people aren't rules for Clinton Inc.	20
1	The so called MSM loves to give advice, period. They asked Bernie Sanders if he should go negative against Hillary in order to be taken seriously. He eloquently told them to piss off.	20
1	She sure hates those banks, until she doesn't.	20
1	To be fair, she has a fair chance that it will work.  If she gets the nomination, the game changes.  Especially if the Republicans field a weak candidate.  The demographics of liberal urban areas is undeniable, and very strong.  Whether it looks that way or not, this is going an uphill battle.	20
1	I honestly don't know much about Jeb. I do know that regardless of all else, the name costs him a point or two during the election.  There are conservatives who won't pull the lever on another Bush after George W's reckless fiscal policies. Many leftists who might have otherwise stayed home won't be able to resist showing up to vote against the name.  He would have to be miles better than the next candidate to not make him a foolish choice.	20
1	He's awful.  Please do not vote for this clown.	20
1	The ONLY difference between Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush..... is the color of the stick used to beat the shit out of the American people...... Blue or Red. Its STILL a stick, and it's STILL beating the shit out of us.	20
1	No you're thinking of Ted Cruz	20
1	All is forgiven.  Heck, Reddit wants to nominate Bernie Sanders.  While he certainly matches the Reddit groupthink, he is hilariously unelectable. Maybe we should back him too.	20
1	&gt; Rules for regular people aren't rules for Clinton Inc.  Does this apply to Bush Inc?	20
1	Fauxcahontas ain't Brokahontas.	20
1	I doubt democrats think all republicans are first generation hispanic americans.	20
1	Words can't express how disappointed I will be if the 2016 presidential election is Bush vs Clinton.	20
1	At least they would have a realistic image of what conservatism is supposed to look like.	20
1	A quote from Harry Reid fits perfectly to describe the medias response: "Well... Romney lost, didn't he?"	20
1	I really doubt that. From what I see, he has a strong social conservative streak. Hillary has no such thing. And like it or not, that's a huge electoral liability for Jeb unless he's got Reagan-level rhetoric to change the minds of a couple generations that - like it or not - see issues like pro-life as long settled.	20
1	Watching the hillary thing play out in the mainstream media is fun.  It's as if a Siamese twin was arguing with themselves.  They want to condemn her because she's not completely far left which is what they want.  But they can't figure out if a candidate that they really want....Sanders or Warren....can actually win.  So they can't completely expose her for the zero that she is because she may be the only candidate they have that can actually win.	20
1	My favorite from that election was the New York Times backing McCain all the way through the primaries. As soon as he clenched the nomination they launched a hit piece as a front page story about him having an affair with a Lobbyist (during an election where lobbyists were the devil). The story was completely fabricated but the damage had been done.  There is no bias here, move along	20
1	So after her overtly racist Tweets from last week, where it's apparent that she hates white men - Boston University is still hiring her? How could that not be the end of this bozo?	20
1	Perry was knocked out due to his blunders in the primary debates. He acknowledges that he wasn't as polished as he should have been and that he will run a stronger campaign this time around.	20
1	Can't wait for 2016!	20
1	There a reddit exodus?  Isn't that how reddit got started - the answer to digg?	20
1	No offense, but have you been on reddit at all outside of this sub? R/politics and most of reddit has a major hard on for bernie Sanders who is not at all what you described. They have literally been complaining about Hillary being handed the nomination by moneyed interests and the DNC non-stop.	20
1	Perfect response.  This guy is on point!	20
1	I'm with Ted!  I hope that the damn establishment doesn't get in the way and destroy the Republican party.  If we get another Mit or McCain the turnout will be abysmal and then there's no turning back.	20
1	Great reply! He was ranked number one in the nation as a debater when he was at Princeton. It will be rare that he is caught off guard with a gotcha question.  [From the Daily Princetonian - April 8, 1992: Two members of the Princeton Debate Panel, Ted Cruz '92 and David Panton '92, are currently the number-one-ranked debate team in the United States, according to a computation by the American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA).](http://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/princetonperiodicals?a=d&amp;d=Princetonian19920408-01.2.12&amp;srpos=2&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-Ted+Cruz------)	20
1	That's because the overwhelmingly obvious answer is no, he does not hold animosity toward homosexuals. It's a stupid question.	20
1	Shhhh...you'll upset the narrative...	20
1	I think it is relevant in that the left/media (redundant, I know) are still holding the line that no one lied and that this is a fabrication.	20
1	I hear him turning around a stupid question.  Being against gay marriage is no more anti-gay than being against abortion is anti-woman.  And he's probably had that same exact question asked a hundred times.  And he did answer it when he said he's a Christian and he must love everyone.	20
1	I'm sure part of it was posturing by the left, as you alluded to. But isn't it possible also McCain at the very least emphasized his most conservative views to win the primary?  I was a tad young in 2007 to really know :D	20
1	eh, he did kind of answer. "As a Christian, scripture commands us to love everybody."	20
1	I love the way he handled that. Nice job.	20
1	Would you answer a loaded question?	20
1	Yes, and those people are morons.	20
1	He's trying to point out that all of this "concern" for the rights of homosexuals is only single-issue pandering to the gay community.  If liberals cared about gays they wouldn't be so quick to circle the wagons around extreme Muslims every time they go try to kill somebody for [drawing a box of macaroni and cheese and calling it Mohammed.](http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/13/us/cartoonist-still-in-hiding/index.html)	20
1	I never thought I'd see the day someone says something good about Bush	20
1	I like Cruz.  I wish that he was more critical of the USA Freedom Act.	20
1	Ok. I am a conservative that has no problems with gays.   It doesn't affect me and more importantly it AIN'T MY DAMN BUSINESS.  That said there is a horrendous state of hypocrisy when any perceived slight against gays is portrayed as "the war on gays" while the same dimwitted shitbags fawn over how Iran and their cohorts are abused by the U.S. and are 'culturally different while executing these gays.  So I'm tired of idiots like you trying to use moral relavatism in the most immoral of ways.  That is; to deny reality in order to score political points.  To hell with you and your cowardice.	20
1	First:  Argentina.  Second:  if anything, this seems more like homophobia.  The ruling is predicated upon the notion that since the child is gay he's somehow automatically dtf, making it literally impossible for the child to be raped by a man.	20
1	He did. Instead of playing ball he showed the reporter how dumb the question was. Are democrats being hounding by reporters asking them "Do you hold animosity against Christians? Do you not support religious freedom?" These are negative gotcha questions that have an automatic answer of "no". But the fact that they are asked is because that wasn't a true journalist but a partisan shill playing identity politics.	20
1	That was the 6th question he received on the topic. I imagine first 5 were "no I don't". There comes a point when you need to point about the partisan shill acting like a journalist. Loaded questions exist for a political reason, end of story.	20
1	When it comes to the job of the president of the United States ISIS killing homosexuals is *very* relevant. It is 100% more relevant than any of the other questions in regards to this as the president has *no power* in regards to that (though Obama likes to pretend he does).	20
1	They Cruz and Paul are handling gay marriage and abortion is beautiful to watch.	20
1	If it is between Jeb or Hilary we are screwed. Stand with Rand!	20
1	Its almost as if they think the facts matter to these people.	20
1	So actually making the question relevant is being a master manipulator? I think you're butt hurt that tired liberal tactics aren't going to be effective here.	20
1	Feels &gt; reals.	20
1	People quickly forget how cruel and inhuman Saddam was.	20
1	The question was "do you hate gay people?", not "are you against gay marriage?".  It was a childish question and Cruz handled it like a pro.  I get the implication, but this person simply wanted to pin Cruz as anti-gay which is on a larger scale than just marriage.	20
1	Sorry, but you couldn't be more wrong. That's the McCain/Romney/Rove strategy, and it is a failed strategy. Answering it directly as you suggest gives legitimacy to the premise, as if there were some reason or evidence to believe that he *does* have personal hatred. An intelligent debater when faced with a loaded question like this attacks the premise to delegitimize the question and the person asking it for being a shill not a journalist. Cruz handled this perfectly. In the end he did answer it ("scripture commands me to love everyone.") but not before exposing the absurdity of the activist dressed up as a journalist.   http://www.fallacyfiles.org/loadques.html	20
1	I'll be damned.  That voat site's equivalent of /r/politics isn't a one-sided liberal cesspool.  [Check it out](https://voat.co/v/politics).	20
1	They still try to pretend Cruz is stupid even though he immediately saw through the lefts trap and didn't fall into it.	20
1	Mitt was not that bad. He is no Rand but he was light years better then Obama.	20
1	Couldn't it be argued that the second picture directly flows from the first?	20
1	Why do you think he's an asshole?	20
1	I didn't vote for the man, but it's pretty obvious that Mitt Romney knows how to be an executive and make a plan.	20
1	Hey, she took a huge pay cut from Indian casino royalties in order to teach those trust fund babies all about inequality and privilege.	20
1	Being against so called gay marriage does not make one a bigot.	20
1	You just assumed she was genuine?	20
1	I don't blame her for taking the pay, but her rallying against high tuition costs is kind of hypocritical. It's would be like someone who is pro-life taking a job at an abortion clinic.   It's just one of the many things she's hypocritical about though, so it's just par for the course.	20
1	Sigh.   &gt; Was it proven that the dude didn't rape her?  To everyone that matters satisfaction, yes. A long time ago. She was stalking *him* more than the other way around, and she sounds like she has some other issues.   Nungesser has chosen (under the wise counseling of his attorneys) to not sue Emma Sulkowicz, A.K.A. 'Mattress Girl'. She has no money. It's a 'blood from a turnip' kinda thing.   He did choose to sue Columbia, and wisely waited until graduation to do so. He has a real case against Columbia which will probably be settled out of court.	20
1	He didn't do it. It's an ongoing theme. Catch up.	20
1	You're not really giving any examples. You're just throwing ad hominem remarks around. Likely, you're just a butthurt liberal. Checking your post history seems to confirm this.   from /r/politics  &gt;From Jeb to Jindal all on the R side are hucksters and bigots. To allow them the Presidency will speed the degradation of this countries' great nation status.	20
1	Referring to the Constitution is the best defense to these attacks.	20
1	I see he familiarized himself with his comrades' works.	20
1	Right! Invading sovereign countries to impose our imperial will is where it's at!	20
1	A delusional male student publicly harassing a female student would be destroyed in seconds. Here, a deranged girl is celebrated as if she were saving the planet from the patriarchy. Political correctness is ugly and stupid and thriving.	20
1	Sure, I can give you that. But it's a facile argument.  There are plenty of things that were grossly mismanaged during Bush's administration (dismantling the civil service and basically just cutting loose the original Bathist troops - which go on to become the backbone of the insurgency).   The whole thing has been a shitshow, and the consensus is already forming across people of all political stripes that it's all been a mistake.	20
1	Now connect that referendum with the hive mind's distaste for lobbying and money in politics....  [The fairest referendum money can buy - An American foundation has poured millions into a campaign to support same-sex marriage in Ireland. -Atlantic Philanthropies, cheerfully acknowledges that it has poured about US$28 million over the past 13 years into strategic LGBT campaigns in Ireland.](http://www.mercatornet.com/conjugality/view/the-fairest-referendum-money-can-buy/16178)	20
1	I think Jeb is worse which is why I downvoted.	20
1	That old rag? /s	20
1	No one person is going to be your exact match politically. It's more about picking someone who you trust to lean towards your views rather than expecting them to be your political doppleganger.	20
1	That really doesn't work with somebody who went to Harvard, Harvard Law, and Princeton - without affirmative action or daddy helping.	20
1	Lobbying is evil unless it involves gay rights, I guess. /s	20
1	Or abortion, or racial quotas, or illegal immigration, or green energy, or anti-fracking or...  :/	20
1	It still puzzles me that some people on Reddit still seem to think that a person who employs a million people isn't worth a 6 or 7 figure income... but someone who teaches one college class is.	20
1	Ted hit this one out of the park.  I heard on the radio that when the reporter aired the story he began with this lede.. "Ted Cruz refuses to deny he has animosity for gays".  Incredible.  Shameless.  What a fool.	20
1	It's not a good time to be a firefighter in the FDNY. There's also a [black diversity hire](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3085400/FDNY-company-want-cowardly-rookie-sacked-running-away-scene-fires-report-claims.html) who refuses to fight fires.  But isn't it a great time for diversity. We have under-qualified women and blacks that can proudly wear the badge of the FDNY. Sure some people will die because they cannot/refuse to fulfill their duties, but at least we can celebrate the fruit salad we've created with artificial quotas and lowered standards.	20
1	Personally, I hope people keep assuming he is a moron like *all* Conservatives are.  Going to make it much easier to turn what they think are "gotcha" questions sure to result in devastating soundbites into home runs.	20
1	The democrats created an entire social class that will vote for them. It was genius, really. Sad, but genius.	20
1	What /u/minibudd said can't be repeated enough.   The reporter did not want an answer to the question. It was not a question in the classical sense of "question". The answer to the question didn't matter. The question was a statement of how the reporter felt. Giving one's own answer to is serves no purpose.  "Do you beat your wife?" "Do you hate women?" "Why do you hate Mexicans?"	20
1	The great irony here is that the women the feminists hail as heroes are the ones they should fervently despise.  Fake rape accusations cause the general general public to become more skeptical every time a women comes forward with a rape allegation.    This women needs psychiatric help and I hope the guy cleans up in his lawsuit.  Rape is serious but so are false rape allegations.	20
1	One person.  Rand Paul.	20
1	yea, but, for my taste, Cruzer was **WAY** too nice to the punk	20
1	What difference does it make?!?!?!	20
1	Like 12 choices. I'll take any of them over Jeb. We got way more good choices than normal this time.	20
1	Stand with Rand. His filibuster was spent actually talking about the issue at hand.	20
1	Jeb Bush supports Obamacare?  REALLY?  Edit: Jeb* not Jen LOL	20
1	the stand might actually get him some democrat votes	20
1	I have a tough time deciding between him and rand paul. I tend to lean towards Paul, and I am from Texas	20
1	For me it's between Rand Paul and Scott Walker.	20
1	Bloated legislation with a lot of kick backs, a lot of regulation, and did nothing to address cost (which was its primary selling point). You could even argue that it exacerbated cost.	20
1	This was during their musical number, right?	20
1	"Most Transparent Administration Ever" is a bi-partisan problem I see...	20
1	But healthcare is a human right, derp!	20
1	I've been entertaining the idea of Rand, can't get behind walker.	20
1	Most of the real issues facing our country are bi-partisan. Neither party should be trusted. We should all be united in our disapproval and demands for transparency and accountability of our government, regardless of which side of the aisle we sit on.	20
1	He had bipartisan support. He also had bipartisan opposition.	20
1	If those two get the nominations then we need a "None of the Above" box to check on the ballot.	20
1	Walker is another [fake fiscal conservative](http://swampland.time.com/2013/07/17/scott-walkers-big-gamble/) who echos Obama in stating we should ["strike the right balance" between liberty and security.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbw-ZqipaTs) That's a non-starter for me. That's as far as I even care to look at him. In the very unlikely event that he agreed with me on everything else, and there's still no way I would vote for him.	20
1	You don't represent 90% of Americans. Premiums went up across the board and the "get more" is stuff that none of them use. And yes they went up faster than what Obamacare proponents projected would be the case if they had not passed the bill.	20
1	Hatch almost got primaried out before the last election to a Tea Party candidate.  Same with McConnell and Boehner, but their monied interests mounted last minute campains against the Tea Party challengers.  Term limits sound better and better every day.	20
1	Yeah, I would never sit here and defend Bill Clinton. That man was (and maybe still is) a sleaze. But Bill Clinton isn't lecturing me on family values, either.	20
1	There is zero chance that any President is going to be able to substantively change abortion law one way or the other.  Regardless of your stance on the issue, as a Presidential campaign issue it's about as important as whether they like broccoli.	20
1	I'm a Kentucky native and 30 years of McConnell has held this state back in so many ways. He's bought and paid for by big business interests. They hold the coal industry over our heads (accounts for ~2% of the jobs in the state and falling all the time) while the rural areas of the state languish, in desperate need of NEW industries, updated infrastructure, the list goes on. So frustrating to see McConnell re-elected time and time again.	20
1	People really don't like Ted Cruz.	20
1	I feel like I'm in /r/politics	20
1	The problem is, his actions were a bigger threat to family than two gay dudes. And yet him and his parents have made a career out of being this wholesome example and bashing gays. That's the definition of hypocrisy. Now, if they went through a journey of recovery and healing and all that, I'd certainly respect his opinions on how to avoid those pitfalls and recover from them.	20
1	In reference to a comment in the article I actually would quit doing business with a business that supports ISIS. There's a huge difference between ISIS and Christianity, that being that Christians don't behead people for non-compliance.	20
1	But 1995 had a huge popularity. What was different? Oh yeah, we shut down the government and ramrodded welfare reform and tax cuts down Clintons throat.	20
1	America doesn't need another Bush or Clinton. They need another Lincoln or Reagan.	20
1	Is r/conservative actually defending a child molester? You don't make a mistake on 5 different people.   Edit:  He was taken to a State Trooper, who was a family friend, and no charges were filed. The State Trooper in question is currently serving a 56 year prison term for child pornography.	20
1	His back-assward views on net neutrality are disappointing. I think calling it "obama-net" was what pushed me over the edge. [85% of Republicans](http://time.com/3741085/net-neutrality-republicans-president/) support net neutrality. He needs to get with the freaking times - this is not an "Obama initiative" - it's fucking bipartisan. He became a complete idiot in my eyes after tweeting that nonsense.	20
1	&gt;I cannot say, ‘Well because you feel bad, I will stop believing what I believe,’” he said.  That is exactly what the left is after, though.  "Think, act and believe like me...or else!"	20
1	I agree, his actions aren't unforgivable provided the right things have occurred.   However, it does mean that him and his parents lose all credibility to cry about gays destroying family values and worry about transgender individuals being child predators.	20
1	Somehow the gay movement went from asking for tolerance, to acceptance, to absolute adherence/compliance.	20
1	Would you classify it as a mistake if someone molested your daughter?  Or would you want to see the punishment he'd receive from general population? It's not a mistake when it's done to 5 different girls.	20
1	You're a worthless libtard socialist.	20
1	You absolutely cannot trust Ted Cruz if you are a conservative that cares about the internet.  He received massive campaign contributions from Comcast and has been attacking net neutrality for months now.	20
1	There's a very important word missing from everything that you've written on the subject. The "mistake" that he made was a CRIME!  A heinous one.  One of the most egregious criminal acts in modern society.  He didn't do it once.  We don't know how many times he did it, but we do know that it happened at least 5 times.  Who cares if he sought help. He should have been punished for it!	20
1	TIL: Adultery is worse than child molestation.	20
1	Well then problem solved!  Now I suppose we should stop investigating murders after a period of time as long as the suspect went to therapy!  Same thing for rapists.  I'll tell you what.  As long as you go to therapy and stop doing committing the crime you can any damn thing you want. /s	20
1	Rand Paul would be a better president than the two of these combined. I stand with Rand.	20
1	Except theirs of course ... That's free speech in their twisted brains.	20
1	And how exactly is the Christian jeweler in this article imposing his morality on anyone?	20
1	We don't know the jeweler's policy on refunds.  The fact that he initially didn't refund them when they asked and only did so after being threatened might suggest that he doesn't usually give refunds.  Also the fact that he was threatened and harassed at all is a problem.	20
1	Not true. They just don't need it as a major part of their platform. Cruz has the best approach of saying it should be left to the power of the states.	20
1	What happened to:  "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."  I don't know about you, but I don't think Life is created at Birth.	20
1	All Statists, but not equal.  I'll take a minority of fascists to a majority.   It's pretty clear which party tends toward government totalitarianism more than the other.	20
1	Opposition to NSA surveillance should be something that those on the left and on the right should be united in opposition towards. It doesn't work, it hurts American businesses, it violates our rights, and it's unconstitutional. There's literally no reason to have it	20
1	I'm all for naming highways, schools, bridges and building statues for people who piss liberals off.   Rush Limbaugh Parkway.   William F Buckley Memorial Bridge.   Christ Kyle Memorial Highway.   George "Dubya" Bush School for the Blind   Etc	20
1	Sexuality has no place in Scouts.	20
1	Northern Virginia liberals have been pissed at stuff like this for a while.   One example that comes to mind is that a good amount of NoVa schools are named after confederate generals. J.E.B. Stuart HS is the most ghetto in the entire region, ironically. Also, Reagan National Airport (which they refer to as national), and Jeff Davis highway (route one).	20
1	Agreed, though it's so pathetic that liberals get uneasy or even pissed off when it comes to heroes like Kyle.	20
1	&gt; 85% of Republicans support net neutrality. He needs to get with the freaking times - this is not an "Obama initiative" - it's fucking bipartisan.  You mean like continuing to inflate the federal government, slightly slower out of control spending? These are also things that are pretty bipartisan and a whole heck of a lot of republicans in Congress support.   Yeah, no, I agree, Cruz needs to get with the freaking times.	20
1	Good lord this is frightening. What the hell is happening to this country?  We look more and more like a liberal arts college campus every day.	20
1	I don't want him to accomplish anything. I want him to leave us alone.	20
1	I know of one who was so uninformed -- or just badly informed by movie critics that she was filled with extra hate -- that I had to correct her rant after the verdict in the Kyle murder trial. Now I know (hope?) she was just an isolated incident, but she thought that Kyle had been found guilty of murder, having no clue that he was dead and the trial was for his murderer.	20
1	RIP Kyle. We can't  thank you enough.	20
1	I st@stand with Rand the Man.	20
1	The bill passed, as far as I can tell, unanimously.	20
1	Bill O' Reilly Plaza.  Marcus Luttrell Park.	20
1	Title could be worded better. To me this is an excellent example of the need to listen/view all sides of any argument.	20
1	Which is what we've been saying all along...	20
1	More regulations... the Progressives are gonna love it!	20
1	Sad part is that many party members will vote for her primarily because a-she's a woman, and b-she's a Democrat and voting Democrat means only having to check one box on the ballet.  Both reasons are adolescent and lazy.  Very few of these types will bother to research the candidate, trusting that whoever it is that is guiding the 'Party' will make decisions that are in the best interest of the country... and not corporate, personal, criminal, or foreign interests and agendas.	20
1	This is actually pretty cool. I'm glad he got to experience the other side of things.	20
1	He's got a fucking point. This is akin to Pelosing Obamacare	20
1	hell yea he does, it's a slap in the face to entire country by the entire political class, especially the Republicans. For gods sake Warren was right on this. I don't care how good for jobs, and the economy or whatever they claim it to be good for. Too keep such a large deal secret is beyond disgusting.	20
1	Aside from the fact they won the last election on don't trust Obama and then give him this..  Let's look at what happened with obamacare. You'll have to wait till it passes.. It doesn't work out well and this is probably going to be worse	20
1	Oh, bulldookie. There's been plenty of progress in the War on Poverty. Why, it's created tens of thousands of jobs for government bureaucrats who vote almost exclusively Democrat and can't be fired no matter how incompetent and lazy they are.   To the left - that's a lot of progress.	20
1	America's Senator, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, voted against it.  That's all I need to know.  On a broader note, I think we're all coming to realize that many of our 2014 victories were illusory.  We **lost** when Boehner and McConnell were re-elected.  I cannot think of one thing this Republican Congress has accomplished that I support.  On the other hand, they passed this abomination and ratified Obama's executive amnesty.  They have sold us out to foreign interests.	20
1	This should be mandatory for all community organizers with the results published on the net.	20
1	Tell your friends, relatives, and anyone who will listen DO NOT GIVE ANY MONEY TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!!!  Instead, give money to the Conservative candidate who seems least likely to become a RINO.  Joni Ernst...pig de-nutter my-ass ya fuckin liar.  I keep track of the money I've been able to re-direct from the RNC by convincing friends to stop giving.  $25k+ so far.	20
1	&gt; But given how Elizabeth Warren hates it (based on what she has seen, and to my understanding can't talk about) - I am all for it.   Nobody who voted knows what's in it.  The text of the bill was kept secret from most of the Senate--and it was kept secret from the public.  Regardless of where you stand on free trade, the very process and transparency of this vote should tell you to oppose it.	20
1	You have no idea if it's a good deal because YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S IN IT.  No one can say for sure if it actually supports free trade.  More significantly, we have no idea what other little goodies are in there waiting to blow up in our faces.  I wouldn't support it if Ted Cruz were the President.  No more expanding the authority of the office of the President, and no more passing secret bills!	20
1	No more looking at our dick pics, NSA.	20
1	If they're going to block anything, they need to block the Patriot Act, itself, when it comes back up for renewal.  Anything less and our liberties will still be compromised.	20
1	As far as I know Paul and Wyden are working on blocking both.	20
1	Imagine showing this headline to George Washington out of context.	20
1	Section 215 requires warrants. the NSA ignores this section. Writing new laws for the NSA to ignore won't stop them.	20
1	OMG Hillary is not LYING!!! She just misspoke. yeah that's the ticket, misspoke.	20
1	&gt; When will Republicans who care about winning national elections, or actually governing, stop thinking of Fox as a help and start viewing it as a hindrance, and what will happen when they do?  Liberals want Republicans to win elections?  And they can help themselves by getting rid of Fox News?    Each day I grow more thankful that a certain percentage of the population can think for themselves and don't believe what they read in the media.	20
1	That's all well and good if you want to make those choices. If your personal choices were to negatively impact someone else, I would hope they would be able to sue you for damages.	20
1	She's the liberal that keeps on giving. She was on that flotilla full of Jihadists that got boarded by Israel and claimed they were shooting her with radiation. She later appeared on Gaddaffi state propaganda to talk about the evils of America during the 2011 Libyan War. During her stint as a far-left Congresswoman she assaulted a capitol security guard with her phone.	20
1	What liberals don't understand about Fox News: Just because they push a different opinion doesn't mean they're the anti-christ.	20
1	My god! You do know that the belief that vaccines give kids autism came from a very false, misleading and possibly criminal and misguided article in the British journal of medicine by some crack pot right? Vaccines do not cause autism. This lady and now you are believed to have autism if you believe this bullshit. Idiots.	20
1	This is not a "reddit is liberal" complaint thread, this is proof of organized thought suppression in major subreddits other than /r/politics. Please do not remove this mods.	20
1	She is truly missed in congress.  A fine example of a minority group liberal.    What's really scary is that she finally lost a democratic primary after being elected several times.  As with obama, I always wondered if she actually believed the nonsense that she spewed or just lied to impress her idiot voter base.	20
1	She's got to be pissed off.  She always figured that she would always be getting the full backing of the lying liberal media regardless of what lies she spewed.  Democrats are used to not having to make value judgments about lying.  And why should they when the news sources that their voters watch or read never call them out on it.  They threw her under the bus to get the worst president in history elected.  Are they doing it now to get the nomination for Pocahontas?	20
1	I have to disagree.  I think it's important to hear their liberal guests spout their agenda and then have it debated.    The vast majority of people are only hearing their agenda without ever having it exposed as just that, an agenda and not factual.	20
1	Let's assume for a second that McKinney is right. Throw that on the list of reasons why minorities (am a minority too) should not be pro-government and consider that she is pro-government?	20
1	If you think Fox is that bad, try reading a Huff Post article.	20
1	Meanwhile there is no dileneation between news and opinion when you have Rachel Maddow leading election news coverage over at MSNBC.   It's hard to take any criticism about "misinformation" coming from "Faux News" when MSNBC, al-Jazeera, Huffington Post, and RT continue to exist.	20
1	Wait... She was seriously a congresswoman?	20
1	None of those guys (Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck) claim to be "reporters". They don't exactly hide that that they are opinion pundits.	20
1	Yes. Six terms. She was also the Green Party nominee for POTUS in 2008.   Yes, she assaulted a US Capitol police officer when she wasn't wearing and kind of security clearance, walked around the metal detectors, then 'allegedly' punched the officer during the altercation.   Her fellow Democrats in Congress evidently never had a very high opinion of her, either.   Read her Wiki page - she's a real piece of work.   **http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_McKinney**	20
1	Right, that's what it's about. These are people fine with MSNBC, John Stewart, and vice	20
1	I've been banned from about 5 subs now that have absolutely nothing to do with politics, and never been given a real answer as to what rule I broke - anything. I'm not stupid. I know most of crap on Reddit like that has *everything* to do with being a mod here on /r/Conservative.   In addition to that there's the internet stalkers with nothing better to do than harass me and any other known Reddit conservative.   Eh whatever - who cares about fake internet points, right?  It's really bizarre the lengths that the left will go to in order to silence conservatives.	20
1	Interesting idea.  Hey, fuck you and your vaccines, but I'd like some more of that free health care?  I'm curious where she falls on some pro-government stuff, an interesting dilemma for her, perhaps.	20
1	Six times elected from a district in Atlanta.  Hooray for us in GA.	20
1	Would she like my address? Or would she prefer to meet somewhere neutral?	20
1	Really a toss up whether she or Pelosi are the dumbest people in Congress...	20
1	Welp, time to move to voat or some other forum, because this idiocy is just too much.  The era of the free, wild, digital frontier is over.	20
1	I'm sure Shelia Jackson Lee (locally known as "she-jack") will undoubtedly pick up the slack for dumbassery in Cynthia's absence.	20
1	"Quoting former Nation of Islam leader and New Black Panther Party chairman, Kallid Abdul Muhammad, Sheppard wrote of whites, 'we give them 24 hours to get out of town by sundown.'"  Doesn't "sundown" come twice in 24 hours? Shouldn't it be simply "we give you till sundown to git outta town"? Threats should be concise and to the point. Confusing, muddled, unlettered threats just cause people to not take one serious or else just think one a fool.	20
1	37% of people with an (R) after their name don't know what the hell the first amendment is.	20
1	Man, the lib downvote squad gets froggy on the weekends.	20
1	All of the men who are in this picture are conservative. Some of them business conservatives and some Main Street conservatives, but they aren't Democrats.	20
1	Saying Eric Cantor, John McCain, and John Boehner are closet democrats is as true as saying Obama is center-left. That is, not at all.	20
1	Fair and balanced NEWS. News division and opinion host are two different things. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out.	20
1	In addition, even saying Romney is a democrat is overboard.	20
1	They forgot "the shoulder thing that goes up" :(	20
1	I prefer the term "mean stuff" as opposed to "hate speech".   I imagine if you phrased it this way the results wouldn't be so terrifying.  Buzz words are very powerful.	20
1	They're all big statist selling out the American people for their own special interest groups comprised of other "donor-class" Americans. The "left" is just doing it faster --- But it doesn't mean that those pictured are any less guilty of being the same pieces of shit.	20
1	&gt; business conservatives  Hahaha, clever way to say "crony capitalists". Nice, I haven't heard that one yet.	20
1	National Review had lost any of its credibity, to me at least, when it fired John Derbyshire for writing a common sense opinion piece	20
1	JFK would be a "conservative challenge" to McCain	20
1	Looks like you wasted 10 years.	20
1	It is mind boggling to me that someone can spend 10 years researching something and be so wrong. You definitely lied, if you spent 10 weeks actually researching you would have a much different opinion. Reading homeopathy blogs and non peer reviewed "studies" isn't research. That is simply reading OTHER people's opinions. The shit you are reading isn't even research, that's the funniest part. You are doing "research" on stuff that can't even be classified as such and calling it your own. Read a book.	20
1	Am I missing something because I don't really see the poll where people support repealing the entire first amendment.  I'm interpreting it as people were asked if they support criminalizing hate speech, of which 51% of Democrats support so and 37% of Republicans, which is different than repealing the entirety of the first amendment.  People weren't asked if they support repealing the First Amendment (which is more than just Freedom of Speech.)	20
1	God's blessing to those who gave all.  His comfort to those left behind.  I realize this is Memorial Day, but I challenge everyone when you see a soldier, sailor, airman, marine, guardsman that you great them and thank them.  Pick up their tab at a restaurant, pay for their gas when you see them filling up.  These are small gestures for people willing to give their lives for you.	20
1	This is what the left is fighting for. This is what they want.	20
1	&gt;The Times tries to frame it in economic terms; the poor Hispanics pushed out by the rich White people. But when does the Times ever complain about poor Hispanics moving into housing in a White neighborhood and affecting property values? Never.  &gt;Effectively, "diversity" has become a codeword for "let's have fewer white people". That's why this article never once talked about how white people are "diversifying" this Hispanic neighborhood. Since this was a situation of increasing numbers of white people rather than a reduction, the joys of diversity have been replaced by the evils of gentrification.	20
1	People who complain about gentrification are huge babies.  When white people leave an urban area, they call it racist white flight that ruins the economy. When white people move into an urban area and improve the local economy greatly, it's called racist gentrification. Are whites just supposed to stay in one area and send all their money to the poor neighborhoods?	20
1	It is scary how similar the diversity movement's tactics are to 20th century fascism. Severely punish dissent, turn people against one-another, and always push the narrative. The 'safe spaces' and 'working class neighborhoods' they advocate for are just separate but equal by another name.	20
1	Liberals hate white people. Whites and Western culture need not apologize for anything, contrary to liberal thought. Whites have committed no sins that other cultures and races have not. Maybe it's time we end immigration from non-western sources, and remember why the world still sees western culture as the model to look up to.	20
1	&gt; Colonialism is the main example of this I should think,  The "sin" of colonialism includes spreading Western medicine, infrastructure, and standards of living to parts of the world that would otherwise still be using spears and teepees	20
1	&gt; Are whites just supposed to stay in one area and send all their money to the poor neighborhoods?  According to liberal economic policies, yes.	20
1	A real version of this illustration was on the top of /r/pics and made it to the front page today   http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/376k03/_/	20
1	&gt; When white people leave an urban area, they call it racist white flight that ruins the economy. When white people move into an urban area and improve the local economy greatly, it's called racist gentrification. Are whites just supposed to stay in one area and send all their money to the poor neighborhoods?  Real simple answer though.  Take your money and move elsewhere.  Capitalism always works.	20
1	&gt;Does this really contribute anything to the discussion? Conservatives sure seem to love it when they are painted as hating black people.  Sure. Nothing wrong with pointing out liberal double standards for liberty and equality. They need to remove the plank in their own eye before pointing out the speck in another's.	20
1	The most pathetic thing about it is that it's mostly self-flagellating white people pushing these illogical and self-destructive policies.	20
1	Japan sought to emulate western culture beginning with the Meiji restoration. Only after being humiliated by the hands of westerners did they try to copy western culture. Japanese culture today has massive western influences	20
1	Here's to everyone who never came back.  You are not forgotten.	20
1	Let me guess, some Soros funded paid rabble-rousers. Like usual.	20
1	Thorium nuclear is the way of the future, a future I propose.  Safe, electric, and plentiful.   It's just a matter of time.	20
1	Sure, I'll bite.   &gt;Most immigrants today,legal and especially illegal dont even give 2 shits about today.  I downvoted because you just pulled that out of your ass. You have no source that immigrants are less likely to observe or care about Memorial Day than the U.S. born. You're ignoring the fact that nearly 5% of the Armed Forces are immigrants and that plenty of immigrants have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country.	20
1	No surprise, America has waged open war on white people even more so white men.	20
1	I firmly believe that the spread and acceptance of my Anglo-Saxon culture based on Judeo-christian values makes the world a better place.  Liberal bitching will never change that.  If a superior culture comes along that makes the world a happier and more prosperous place, I will keep and open mind and see what it has to offer.	20
1	"Fake but accurate" strikes again.  Reality doesn't support the liberal narrative, which is why they lie about everything.	20
1	Funny, the marriage revisionists in America don't seem to agree with you.	20
1	Being denied a position at a job or enrollment at a university despite being the most qualified applicant due to the color of your skin, mandated by law and corporate policy is EXACTLY like Jim Crow laws.	20
1	Re-integration? Are you saying that people should think twice before moving into an area that is dominated by another culture; and/or if they do move to that kind of area, they should not bring their own culture with them?  People should be free to move where ever they like and have whatever way of life they want.  You cannot force people to accept and live another culture in the name of social fairness.   A good christian would never change their culture or values to conform.  We stand for what we believe in and live our lives as we see best.  We don't take cultural suggestions from editorials.	20
1	Taking a comment that is clearly using figurative language and attempting to convince people that you accidentally took it literally does not actually make a clever point even if you are successful at convincing people of your misinterpretation.	20
1	Ugh. That monkey has a mechanical engineering bachelor's degree and nothing more.   He hosted a kids show and now those kids have grown up and started worshiping him. It's absolutely infuriating.	20
1	This Memorial Day, I would rather celebrate our veterans and war dead than celebrate a washed up kids show host.	20
1	You don't need to be non-white to hate white people.	20
1	Diversity is among the most racist ideas alive today	20
1	Gallup polls report since 1994 vs 2008 (the latest I found consensus data on) that there has been an increase in support for abortion to be legal under certain circumstance by ~5%, a decrease in legal under ANY circumstance by ~3%,an increase in illegal in all circumstances by ~3% and marginal change of percent for no opinion. all these numbers are within a margin of error and dont show any conclusive trend towards one way or the other, but there was a negative spike in all columns following 1994, so it did have an immediate effect, but no apparent lasting one.	20
1	I've heard of a lot of cases of women who get abortions and then have horrible regrets afterwards... I've even heard by some that it's an inevitable stage and many will either go pro life or just not care	20
1	Libs know this.  One of the reasons they are pushing for a higher minimum wage is because union wages are based on the percentage the union wage is against the minimum wage.  If the min wage is low they don't get as much. Meaning union bosses don't get as much. Meaning Democrats don't get add much.	20
1	Milton Friedman: The real tragedy of minimum wage laws is that they are supported by well-meaning groups who want to reduce poverty. But the people who are hurt most by higher minimums are the most poverty stricken.	20
1	My wife as a young woman had  an abortion and to this day 28 years later she regrets having an abortion. I don't know how many times in the past 9 years that she has been my wife I have had to help her get out of the funk she puts herself into for having one and I know she will regret it for the rest of her life.	20
1	She said she didn't know as much about how babies develop and how early. As she learned more, she became pro-life.	20
1	&gt;Actually he is very respected. **Not as an scientist,** but as someone who has helped increase the interest in science amongst a younger generation   A scientist who isn't respected as a scientist	20
1	Look up the group Silent no more. I don't want to strip away personal responsibility,  but a lot of women are pressured and victimized by the abortion industry.	20
1	Funny how people who claim others "deny science" (in a way the people used to condemn those who would "deny" the Holocaust, but that's another topic) how they themselves will deny things like Biology or Forsensics. How about societal evolution? Is that a science?  And, of course, they will deny History, which is probably even worse.	20
1	I really couldn't care much less about "the view of many."  Fred Rodgers had a palpable effect on a generation of children.     Bill Nye is absolutely nothing more than a spokesmodel for a political ideology.	20
1	&gt; The rage that consumes these young males deprived of fathers is understandable.  Fucking no it isn't.  A rage that makes someone kill is understood by VERY few.  Convincing a layman otherwise is misguided.	20
1	Did you also know she gave birth to the child in question? She obtained the legal right to an abortion (for herself and so many others), but never actually got the abortion. Many believe she was a VERY confused young woman who was taken advantage of by the leaders of the pro-choice movement.	20
1	You have to admire how liberals are able to market their nonsense with the help of the lying liberal media.  With this current non issue, I always picture a guy with no skills or education, with a wife and 2 kids, flipping burgers with a big smile because he is now getting $15 per hour.  Funny how the majority of the public doesn't realize that if your career is a minimum wage job, raising it to $15 is not going to make a dent in your struggle.	20
1	If more people knew what a developing human is they would be pro-life.	20
1	The only fair way to approach this is to remove fathers from all the privileged two-parent families so we'll all be equal. Mom and Dad can continue to have conjugal visits so that they can create more single-parent children.	20
1	Ugh I grew up watching him and he turned out to be a smug piece of shit.	20
1	Hence the need to conflate murdering the unborn as "pro-choice." They would never be able to successfully defend such atrocities against the innocent if they didn't change the branding away from what "choice" really means.	20
1	So when Americans see people burning down their own cities and looting and rioting over bullshit, the average American doesn't feel the least bit sorry for them?   Well, who woulda thunk? /s	20

1	Blame the sexual revolution that said casual sex is ok and then an overburdensome gov which rewards fatherless house holds	20
1	only if you assume minimum wage laws raise the quality of life of the lowest skilled worker. Turns out they don't.	20
1	I liked his show as a kid, I thought it was fun and informative, then I saw him speak at a college event, and he's a fucking global warming homer.	20
1	&gt; How can increasing minimum wage hurt poverty stricken people?  Unintended consequences.  The same reason "liberalism" in general is stupid, old and busted.	20
1	When I was 18, minimum wage was $5/hr. I got a job at $10/hr. The cost of living was low (because of the minimum wage) so I was able to afford a comfortable lifestyle, as I was a skilled labourer. Now minimum wage is $10.70/hr. I earn $16/hr. But because of inflation (directly due to the increase of minimum wage) it is harder to make ends meet, and those earning minimum wage still can't.	20
1	Typical liberal.  Hates capitalism and market competition.  Bernie and other liberal elites should just take all the money and distribute it as to how they see fit.  They will decide on what the one and only national deodorant is for everyone.  Choice is bad, and frankly, you're too stupid to make any choices on your own.	20
1	The idiot wants to takes us back to the bread lines of the USSR right here at home, as he's basically advocating a command/planned economy.  His comments are a rehash of the old, tired, and busted dipshittery  called [the Nirvana fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy).	20
1	Investment in infrastructure: "Money for union jobs and their pensions"	20
1	Apparently the concepts of free-market economics and supply and demand are completely beyond the reasoning skills of many people. Worse yet, some understand it but exploit the ignorance of others for personal gain. Which is it in your case Bernie - stupid or exploitative?	20
1	Just curious, how old are you?	20
1	I really can't understand why even hyperliberal redditors are in support of this guy. His economic policies would be an unmitigated disaster for this country.	20
1	&gt; if they were paid more, people would stop looking down at folks who work there, as if the honorable job of serving people is scummy and worth making fun of.  If liberal yuppies weren't so full of themselves, they'd stop looking down on their fellow citizens *without* forcing some of them into unemployment via minimum wage.	20
1	This. All of the minimum wage noise is simply about repaying the union leadership. Paticulary, repaying their losses for supporting the ACA.	20
1	Obama won't take no for an answer.	20
1	lets prosecute cops for doing their jobs. then when they back off because of all the pressure from the public, why don't we blame them for increased crime	20
1	&gt; They will decide on what the one and only national deodorant is for everyone.  And of course that one national deodorant will smell like motor oil, because motor oil is the smell of the hard working proletariat.	20
1	Not Democrats. Not the people in charge. Not President Obama. Who is to blame? Bush. Blame Bush. We can all agree on that.	20
1	Don't know why you're being dowvoted, it's fucking true.  The Administration will direct its executive departments to continue operations as normal, completing disregarding whatever the courts say.  Lawlessness, is by definition, the apathy towards the rule of law and its application.  This Administration is unequivocally lawless.	20
1	Is there evidence to back this up?	20
1	Which is why it makes no sense to conflate "minimum wage" with "living wage". Nobody is supposed to support a family on literally the lowest wage you are legally allowed to pay somebody.	20
1	California is not a city.	20
1	I think he has a point.  Why are there only 23 different deodorant brands.  If there were 56, more people would be employed and therefore less children hungry.  We NEED more brands of deodorant.  I suggest we create the Bernie stick, you smell like a member of the political class all day!	20
1	America=Dad  Liberals=teenage girl  Islam=rebel boyfriend	20
1	But hurr durr durr slippery slope fallacy.  Coming to America soon.	20
1	Not really a news flash.  That being said....people need to realize how deadly the years of this subtle and not so subtle propaganda has been.	20
1	Liberals hate America. Islam hates America. They're a perfect match.	20
1	In other news, water is in fact wet.	20
1	The difficulty it takes for someone with a college degree, fluent English and no criminal history to get into the country is shameful.   Instead of making it easier for good, high skilled, hard working people to come into the country, Obama would rather let the drug traffickers pour over the border and block the scientists and engineers.  Why?  Guess which group will vote democrat.	20

1	I'm confused. What was leftist about that trailer?	20
1	You can tell Jon doesn't like him... But has a little respect for him. I think this is the first interview I've seen with Jon where he lets his guest talk.  Also, Rand does a great job of skirting the gay issue, which is the only thing Jon wants to talk about. Lol and he closes it off by telling Jon that Jon agrees with him on the Patriot Act... bravo Rand bravo. It has to take a lot of patience to calmly interact with that clown	20
1	Rand deals with folks he disagrees with better than all the other candidates combined.	20
1	Thinking about how he interacted with Jon, he doesn't give any ground. He doesn't step into Jon's framing. He reframes everything. He doesn't laugh with Jon or the audience at his own expense. Jon's pretty adept at controlling everything on his show, including the audience, and his guest.	20
1	A constitutional right to marriage Jon? That doesn't exist, not even for heterosexuals.   Jon Stewart has been doing this for what, 20 years? Isn't the snarky pseudo comedic routine a bit played out?	20
1	While he was talking Lindsey Graham was caught on camera rolling his eyes. Lol. nbd. Rand's saying it wasn't about his ideas or what he was saying, just that people were frustrated they had to have a late session. If it weren't for Rand they wouldn't have had to stay late on their Memorial Day weekend	20
1	I've always wondered what will happen when/if his viewers decode his routine and see it for what it is.  Will there suddenly be a whole slew of people who completely change their thinking?	20
1	The whole bit about "oooo social security is evil BOOOO" just really put me off, this is so pandering, and could only to appeal to people with a mental age of 8.   It's just really pathetic and sad to see that this is the state of youth interest in politics, this is what it takes to grab the attention of our next generation of leaders.	20
1	You should post this in /r/politics for the lulz	20
1	I did, in the thread about Bernie wanting free College	20
1	I'll look for it. Reddit loves hero worship and they worship Sanders	20
1	Socialism is so vacuous and easy no book is needed. All socialism requires is eyes to see the fruits of someone's labor and a mealy mouth to opine those should be taken. Socialism is theft by mere words. The bank robber needn't understand accounting, interest rates nor currency rates in order to wander in off the street to steal. Socialists who understand basic economics cease their silly socialist ways.	20
1	Reddit loves socialism, communism and "social justice".  So basically being lazy and bitching about the successful.	20
1	Hillary isn't corrupt, she is just keeping secrets from us in our best interest. /s	20
1	They'll love socialism until they're forced to pay for it.	20
1	Hillary Clinton is corrupt and surrounded by scandal, which should preclude her from ever holding public office again, much less the presidency.	20
1	which scandal? there are a few she is embroiled in.	20
1	Whitewater, Benghazi, emails, and whatever else I'm forgetting.	20
1	But wait, there's more!	20
1	The downvotes are strong in this thread. Hilary supporters are working overtime.	20
1	My last sliver of hope in humanity is the notion that American law doesn't preclude her from holding public office, but the American voter will.	20
1	You think that pointing out that Hillary is corrupt as hell will stop libs of any kind from voting for her? Oh my sweet summer child. . .	20
1	Its amazing how she is almost invulnerable to liberals and the media, the *constant* pile of dirt that somehow washes off of her over 3 decades is just I don't know...here in VA liberals crucified Bob McDonnell over something so comparatively insignificant.  Maybe I would have respect for some liberals if they were 1500% less hypocritical.  They'll character assassinate at will, at all costs, yet they'd rather rip their eyes out than look upon their own wrong doings.	20
1	Lying about coming under fire in Bosnia, that's sort of a favorite of mine	20
1	Yeah, the deleted e-mails are just really NSFW.	20
1	I so do want Sanders to win the Democratic Party's nomination. The general election would be a cakewalk for any Republican except for maybe Rand Paul.	20
1	It was a master stroke how he dealt with the school shooting question. The question was valid in the sense that lives taken domestically are as important as lives lost to foreign terrorists, but it was clearly meant to attack the second amendment, which Jon knows Rand supports.  Instead of firing back and getting into that debate, Rand instead generalized the whole point without dodging the question: Yes, lives lost when U.S. citizens murder other U.S. citizens are important, and we don't blame everyone involved for every lost life.	20
1	Its so apparent I don't know how anyone could support her campaign.	20
1	Stewart tried to make it sound like Rand was equating gays to the KKK puhhhhhlease. great job by the senator reacting to that well	20
1	Just her and Biden sexting.	20
1	Oh, it'd be a cakewalk for Rand as well. I don't think Sanders can get enough people to live in their dreams for more than a few weeks. People will wake up and smell the BS at some point.	20
1	threw up in my mouth a little bit there	20
1	Having seen this on the front page and fitting into the named demographic: Fuck Hillary Clinton. Seriously. I'm against government corruption and that's why I'm actively working against the Clinton or Bush presidential dynasties from continuing.  Clinton isn't being supported by liberals, she's being supported by [banks, mostly](https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=n00000019). If you want to talk about the person liberals are actually supporting, come check out [r/SandersforPresident](http://np.reddit.com\/r/SandersForPresident/). Check out who he's [supported by](https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2014&amp;cid=N00000528&amp;type=I).	20
1	&gt; In Sanders’s utopia in South America, the government imposed price controls in the name of redistributing basic goods to the poor and seized a toilet-paper factory to cure the inevitable shortages. The lines are long. The shelves are empty. The daily battle for subsistence is brutal.   Ah...heart warming....the liberal utopia.    But of course that's for the masses, not the elites like good ole Bernie, Pocahontas, or Hillary.	20
1	Her best point is that those coming here illegally to escape eternal poverty are in fact bringing down our country to the same level of poverty that they escaped.	20
1	Honestly, I hope Sanders gets the nomination. On the one hand, while I disagree with his ideology, as with Dennis Kucinich I admire the purity of it, and his honesty and bravery in expressing it.  On the other, he will be soooo easy to beat in the election.	20
1	Not all of us. In fact, on reddit I would say most support Bernie Sanders here. I don't think I have seen a single pro-Hillary post.	20
1	On The Five yesterday the one liberal panelist said (paraphrasing) that despite how corrupt Hillary is, she's still voting for her because of the social causes Hillary supports.  I think that pretty much sums up that voting base.  They couldn't care less that Hillary is morally bankrupt.  The social issues evidently dwarf anything else going in this country like the silly economy or global terror threat.	20
1	If the USA has a "moral" obligation to have open borders....doesn't it have a "moral" duty to extend its taxing authority to the countries donating the illegals.  Those additional taxes could pay for the boat trips back.	20
1	I watched the whole thing and I thought Jon Stewart was pretty rude.  Admittedly that's the first time I've watched a Daily Show clip in 5 years so I don't know how Stewart normally treats Republican guests.	20
1	I sincerely wonder if this guy also supports banning clothing with mixed fabrics and making tattoos illegal.	20
1	I'm amazed they can muster up the strength to down vote after reading so much 'hate speech' on here.	20
1	But it just hasn't been applied properly yet, people!!!!	20
1	Just did, deleted for "No petitions or polls."	20
1	Rand Paul just smacked Stewart on a much deeper level than most if any the of viewers caught. He brought that full circle then plunged fathoms deep	20
1	Actually most liberals, the truly left-wing side of the Democratic party support Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Since Warren isn't running for president, Bernie is the true left wing liberal candidate, not Clinton.	20
1	The guy clearly has a mental disorder.	20
1	This website will be fun once the campaign kicks off and reddit.com literally becomes her internet headquarters.	20
1	&gt; Some perspective from a non-American. Any time this topic comes up, I'm reminded of the Top Gear episode in which they go to some Christian town with gay slogans painted on their cars. It takes about a minute of stopping for fuel before they get assaulted, some lady calls "the boys", and the entire crew is attacked by rednecks. **Anyone classifying that as anything other than "hate" is a slight bit out of touch with reality.**  No, anyone making a judgement about an entire religious group based off an episode of Top Gear is a slight bit out of touch with reality.	20
1	I too believe everything I see on television.	20
1	Exactly! The problem is that Venezuela has only nationalized 85% of the economy, not the full 100. It's the 15% of privately owned businesses, which are small trinket shops and stores,  who are destroying the economy intentionally.	20
1	You mean I can't keep my plan!? Or my minimum wage job!?	20
1	What is admirable about someone who promises to take the majority of your paycheck to give to people he likes?	20
1	Capitalism good for Pocahontas.  Capitalism bad for you.  I had never read this about her.  But not surprising.  After getting a free ride by lying about being an native American, I guess lying just became a default position for her.  Even though conservatives espouse the benefits of capitalism, imagine one of the conservatives running for the nomination having done exactly what Pocahontas did.  It would be front page news about how he/she screwed poor home owners to make a profit off them.  But you'll never see this info about Warren anywhere in the lying liberal media.	20
1	What is bad about improving a property, selling it for a profit, and raising the value of ALL the other homes in the neighborhood? I'm confused.	20
1	Where is anyone saying women are stupid? That's a really closed minded view of conservatives to assume that	20
1	Absolutely nothing.  The point is not that profit is bad.I remember her railing non-stop about the profits the banks and mortgage companies made. And about how they took advantage of home owners. And about how those in over their head were exploited by those with fat wallets. The point being how horrible it was that some profited off the misfortune of others.	20
1	Well she's not running for POTUS so this isn't really damaging.  I mean, if someone running for President was exposed as being undeniably corrupt, his/her campaign would be doomed from the beginning.  Oh wait...	20
1	I don't think that this post has anything to do with women, outside of the meme being a woman, and Clinton being a woman.	20
1	Liberal here (getting ready for the downvotes). But I just wanted to stop by and say that I don't love Hilary as a candidate. I just think she's the lesser of all the evils. Which is a bummer because I'd love to vote for someone who is actually genuine but our governmental system is fucked.	20
1	She is corrupt. I can tell you my personal experience. she came on strongly to the Muslim communities/mosques with promises back in her New York senate elections. Not only did she not follow through, she absolutely stopped contact and returned all the money she borrowed.  It may sound like it is nice that she returned the money. However, she definitely benefitted from the larger pool of money for a long while. As it was returned *after* she won her position.  We were used and discarded. It makes me feel dirty remembering.	20
1	Well don't vote for her then. I can straight up tell you that if Jeb Bush becomes the nominee that I'm not voting for his ass.	20
1	Who is saying women are stupid? Sounds like you are getting some crappy liberal tslkinh points. Also, liberals have horrible policies that have screwed up the nation more in the past years. The left is the party of the weak minded. No self respecting person can support a party that doesn't believe in self responsibility.	20
1	She's just a regular Brian Williams isn't she.	20
1	So it begins. Criticizing Hilary makes conservatives sexist. I see. Kinda like how criticizing Obama makes conservatives racist, right?  I mean, there's absolutely no way that Hilary can be criticized. She's done nothing wrong! /s  Let's also ignore that the Republicans ran a woman as vice president in 2008 and the fact that a woman is currently seeking the nomination. But no, conservatives definitely hate women.	20
1	That's why you do see a lot of liberals supporting Bernie.  A lot of us don't really like Hillary and hate that she's been "crowned" as our nominee.    Also, a lot of liberals only support her because they think she's the only viable candidate democrats have and would rather have Hillary, with all her faults, than any Republican.  Its not really them being illogical, but just sort of sadly practical lesser of two evils sort of thing.	20
1	If the election boils down to Bush V Hillary, I'm voting for a one way ticket to Canada	20
1	So let me get this straight, you are assuming the OP is a liar because he ostensibly has a different political opinion from your own?  Basically your argument boils down to: "op is a conservative, conservatives are liars, therefore the OP must be a liar". It's a thought process entirely constructed on logical fallacy	20
1	Why would that be the case? Westboro takes everything to the extreme and time and time again courts have ruled that what they do is free speech. If a group can go to a funeral with god hates fags signs and have it protected as free speech and can't see why there would be a worry.	20
1	Hates government corruption  Thinks bigger government will solve corruption	20
1	At least he's upfront about it.	20
1	haha, things are even worse up here; things are so bad that our most conservative province just voted in our third party. hell, we just passed our version of your patriot act with 100% support from both red and blue parties.	20
1	reddit has a lot of hillary hate these days, and that will only get worse once bernie inevitably doesn't make it out of the primaries. hell, most of her supporters only support her as the lesser of two evils	20
1	"And look at all those deodorants! LOOK AT THEM!"	20
1	That mentality is exactly how we ended up with Obama. Everyone i knew had absolutely nothing positive to say about him, they just wanted to feel "cool" and vote against the bush legacy. Sigmund Freud would be having an orgasm if he was able to psycho-analyze the thought process or how/why liberals vote the way they do. Really fucked up reasoning which is sending this country down a slippery slope.	20
1	This. Elizabeth Warren has made her career on demagogery against speculation, high finance, capitalism etc. While as it turns out, she's no stranger to speculative investment herself.   The irony is, the party-flipped version of this (a family values Republican getting caught soliciting gay sex in a public bathroom) would likely be a career-ender, while Fauxcahontas will likely keep on truckin'.	20
1	You need to look up the definition of "Extremist".	20
1	Rubio has since moderated, supporting amnesty for example.  And yes, as the title and picture both state, it represents the field as of today. :)	20
1	With Hillary polling at 60+% and Bernie under 10% I think you misunderstand the word "most"	20
1	Are they polling only liberals and left-wingers, or all Democrats? Believe it or not but being a Democrat isn't always the same as being left-wing or liberal.	20
1	An employee refused to obey directions regarding company property shared by other employees.     She was found guilty of failing to go to her appointed place of duty, disrespect toward a superior commissioned officer, and four specifications of disobeying the lawful order of a noncommissioned officer.     Religious freedom has zero to do with the case. It wasn't her own private computer.	20
1	Flat tax doesn't take into account static priced goods that everyone needs. Take 30% of a $100k/year salary and that person won't be hurting to survive. However, take 30% of someone at the poverty line and they might not be able to pay car insurance. Some of the lower end need less of a burden.	20
1	Nah, I'm just here because I'm offended you think I'd vote for Clinton.	20
1	A 90% tax bracket is probably extreme because it would be well past the Laffer curve "peak": the point of a 90% would not be to bring in more tax revenue, it would likely bring in less than our current rates, but it would lead to almost all the rich moving out of the country.	20
1	It's a fucking sickness with these people.  They're going to talk the same way about Christians soon.  "Just an unwanted growth on the body of the Earth."	20
1	So we can get a double dose of the Obama years?  Your ideology has wrought a lot of shittiness for most Americans.	20
1	The DNC has a long history of using minorities and throwing them away once their usefulness passes. Most don't ever wake up and smell the coffee. Maybe you won't make that mistake again.	20
1	Once their Bernie pipe dream ends, they'll be back on the pant suit express.	20
1	Only a joke. You'd have to be a complete moron to think that either "side" is actually the exaggerated claim that the opposite side says it is. I actually have quite a few liberal views, so you're talking to the wrong guy.	20
1	That's fucking disgusting. Disgusting. Fuck. I am so disgusted. I can't even explain how fucking terrible that is.	20
1	90% tax bracket is still pretty extreme though.	20
1	&gt;     &gt; And how much many would you have to make for him to tax you that much?  &gt;Irrelevant.  You don't get to dodge an answer by saying "irrelevant" just because you know that the answer will make Sanders seem less extreme.  That's the sort of fact dodging I'd expect from MSNBC, don't start that shit.	20
1	Wtf did I just read. My god, salon is the biggest farce as it pertains to journalism, when I see shit from that site hit the front page of politics I shake my head in utter amazement. The bias is Unparalelled.	20
1	If you read the whole thing, you did better than I did.  I got 2 paragraphs in and thought "I don't need to bring this level of evil into my psyche right now."  She's proud of her work?  So fucked up on so many levels.	20
1	Allow the IRS to do our taxes for us? Yeah like not they're not already corrupt. Imagine how much worse it would be if they did the math themselves.	20
1	Gotta light a match to your strawman here.  She has never to my knowledge attacked the process of flipping a house.  She has attacked banks being so big, that if they were to fail, it would undermine the American economy.  I will refer you to the bailouts of 2008.  Just because both end in a profit, does not mean there is hypocrisy.	20
1	Boy, the liberals that lurk this sub sure do hate it when you poke fun at their new king.	20
1	Ted Cruz is considering a standard exemption as part of his flat tax proposal, which makes it a progressive tax system and pretty much invalidates your objection.	20
1	But you see me aborting those little arms and legs are helping WOMEN! That means they are just disposable biological tissue!!	20
1	His stance on net neutrality alone will keep me from voting for him.	20
1	Everything about her is fake, why not her accent?	20
1	College has come to mean political programming, not education. College is where a dissolute girl wanders campus for years dragging a mattress in protest. College is where men go to become effete, feckless, effeminate. College is where women go to learn to hate such men as these. The Left owns higher education and leftists are by definition earnest but none too bright. It's no wonder a howling socialist imbecile like Bernie Sanders wants college to be "free" to mold a generation of idiots willing to vote for slavery.	20
1	Fuck I had to stop reading that. Disgusting.	20
1	This is /r/wtf worthy. I couldn't finish the article.	20
1	I want to cry now. I think that is simply evil.	20
1	There really is a pretty substantial population of liberal lurkers on this sub, isn't there?  They came out en force during that whole Iran Letter "controversy"	20
1	When people say "flat tax" they could be referring to [any of several variations](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_tax).  This is one of them, specifically a Marginal Flat Tax.	20
1	The State Department knew it was terrorism [10 Days in Advance](http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-defense-state-department-documents-reveal-obama-administration-knew-that-al-qaeda-terrorists-had-planned-benghazi-attack-10-days-in-advance/)	20
1	Which is why many flat tax proposals have a safety net built in at the bottom, e.g. the first $25,000 you make wouldn't be taxed at all.	20
1	**[Ronald Reagan: The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'](http://i.imgur.com/C86cFtF.jpg)**	20
1	Of course they did.  They were running weapons to terrorist insurgents to overthrow the Syrian government.  The deal went south.  Fast &amp; Furious: Middle East Edition.	20
1	&gt; I would love to see him and Rand Paul debate.  While they would disagree on the way to get there, I would bet they agree on many things, like cutting defense spending, decriminalizing or even legalizing marijuana and focus on rehab not prison, and also fix the policy that puts a lot of people but mainly minorities in prison.	20
1	So who gets to pick and choose which brands are on the market?  The fucking government?	20
1	He's not a socialist, he's a democratic socialist. The difference between Venezuela and Sweden	20
1	I remember an old john stossel report where he was in Soviet Russia. Someone tried to buy his used sneakers for like 200% of the new price.	20
1	You can't make this shit up.	20
1	Some might say this gives union companies an unfair advantage over nonunion shops. Those people will have their legs broken.	20
1	a silly, and unnecessarily combative advertisement.  If you want to include homosexuals in your advertising, as they exist and are part of the demographic you're shooting for, you can do so without an intentional slight towards others.  Will be funny to see how many SJW come out screaming about boycotting coca-cola.	20
1	I teach one computer class every day. When the kids are online "working", someone (usually 2 or 3) are checking out sneakers. And it's every day -- the same sneakers. And they will forget to hide what they're doing when they start arguing over them. So not needing sneaker choices isn't gonna fly as a message.  (And these are kids that tell me that they can't afford pencils or notebooks, but that's another topic.)	20
1	how is she the front runner for the dems?	20
1	You know what? The world doesn't need a bunch of asshat fuckwad Democratic contenders. How about you all just let Biden run and go feed starving kids instead of pissing away all that campaign money?	20
1	I'm sorry, I can't take what she has to say seriously, and I won't buy her book to see if there are any sources for her data, because her website doesn't give any references either.  If you present data, present the source.  It's simple, gets rid of rhetoric, and builds trust with your base.	20
1	Probably because Democratic candidates are not treated the same way as Republican candidates are.	20
1	Only in the dreams of Redditors.	20
1	&gt; I won't buy her book to see if there are any sources for her data  Sort of the inverse of "we have to pass it to see what it says". You're saying that you don't think she has sources because you don't see them, but you don't see them because you won't buy the book that would have them in it, and you won't buy the book because you don't see any sources?  Joseph Heller always gave me a headache.	20
1	I'll bet you a month of Reddit Gold you're wrong.	20
1	But her other published works are have citations. Just because she doesn't list citations for what is essentially a blog post doesn't mean she doesn't list them for a published work	20
1	They're just worried about a potential boycott due to their ad presence in Qatar for the World Cup.	20
1	Typical communist/socialist, the attitude being you should only get what you absolutely **need**.  And their track record sucks tremendously at even just supplying *that*.  What's amazing is that so very many people are so completely shit-stupid as to fall for this kind of rhetoric.	20
1	I think this is really the one issue both sides are pissed about, I've heard complaints about the NSA from the Leftys when Snowden first leaked. Hopefully they'll actually work with us to stop the domestic spying.	20
1	You better listen to him, man.  He's still in contact with his political contacts. Dude knows his shit.	20
1	It's no coincidence that the Gini coefficient bottomed out and median household income growth flattened in 1965, when the immigration act was passed.  If you flood the labor market with supply, price (i.e. wages) goes down.	20
1	I know you are being snarky but I have an uncle who works for Nintendo. He told me the same thing.	20
1	And we should bring in more now that 94 million are out of work!	20
1	You know it.  Look at Uber trying to fight to stay alive because the super smart government determined it's not fair to taxi companies.	20
1	Why couldn't they just stick to cool polar bears in sunglasses?	20
1	Yeah, how dare her blog post not include the thirty page bibliography from her book. It's almost like she wants people to buy her book.	20
1	Please let Biden run. The more he says the more I laugh.	20
1	Her website doesn't give information about her book? .............perhaps to entice people to...you know.....BUY the book.. How can you criticize something without even reading the source you're criticizing? How you are being upvoted in this sub is beyond me	20
1	We don't need endless choices of hairstyles either. Men and women alike should just adopt the Bernie.	20
1	A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.  -Winston Churchill	20
1	The problem arrises when someone gains power and decides that something you do/have done IS something that they want to punish. For instance, a hyper radical left wing government gains power and know that you subscribe to /r/conservative. This makes you the enemy and even if you stop using /r/conservative they know that you did in the past and are a "conservative sympathizer"  and should be more closely watched for past/current infractions that could lead to your persecution.   You may say that you have nothing to hide but that is dependent on what THEY are looking for, not what you are actually doing.	20
1	Excellent answer and that makes a lot more sense than what ive heard before. Thanks so much!	20
1	Of course she did.   This woman is a real piece of work, huh?	20
1	&gt;-- If Romney had won 71 percent of the Hispanic vote, he still would have lost. If he'd gotten just 4 percent more of the white vote, he would have won.   So can we please stop pretending that appealing to Hispanics is a worthwhile election strategy.	20
1	It's true. CDC says that gays and lesbians and bisexuals are less than 2% of the US pop.	20
1	Good for them.  Maybe...just maybe they will finally figure out cause and effect.  indict cops for arresting a long rap sheet drug dealer, and then cry for police protection.  The best definition I can think of for the community is infantile.  Which is exactly what liberals think of them.  They are too dumb to make their own decisions.  Let them continue to vote for politicians who will ensure that they are treated like perpetual kids.	20
1	&gt;I don't want to spend my hard earned money to know if she lists them or not.  I'll save you from that moral dilemma, she lists them. So now the only thing holding you back from spending your money has been dispelled!	20
1	The old "America was built on theft and exploitation" argument	20
1	Somebody's been reading from Howard Zinn's Great Hits collection.	20
1	In a war their bloodthirsty dictator started...so whatever	20
1	Because this sub has been drifting to the left for some time.	20
1	To add on this, [as documented in this book](http://www.threefeloniesaday.com/Youtoo/tabid/86/Default.aspx), the U.S. legal code is so convoluted and complex that nearly everyone commits some kind of "crime" on a near-daily basis, so anyone who may want to target you for something can pretty easily prosecute you if they're able to monitor you.	20
1	Most cabs I've been in - and I live in a place where licensing is so expensive its cartel like - are driving 10-15mph over the speed limit at all times and taking a bunch of risks. I think the safety point is a bit of a Trojan horse for old school protectionism.	20
1	First it was the America the beautiful ad in different languages now this.	20
1	Better than the Qatar ads..  "When your dieing...of thirst..grab a coke...."	20
1	because Social activism is hip	20
1	Indeed.  Conservative values are for anyone and everyone.  There's no need to pander, and in fact, pandering runs counter to Conservative values.	20
1	My tax money pays for that, freeloader.	20
1	Look up his father. The neoconservative movement was a part of the Democratic party. It only split with the rise of the New Left and Vietnam. They have traditionally, as such, been a bridge between liberalism and traditional conservatism.   It's one of the reasons the rest of us get so indignant when they start talking about 'RINOS' and "true conservatives".	20
1	Cuomo's argument is so stupid that it's laughable.   He starts by saying that she shouldn't be doing that because it offends people, then he says she has a right to do it.   Which the fuck is it, Cuomo, you mental midget?  Listen to his tone throughout the interview. That's the sound of a man that knows he's getting his ass handed to him.   After he concedes her right to display Mohammed (Propellor Beanie Upon Him) cartoons, the rest of the interview is Cuomo (a so-called professional 'journalist) displaying his complete and total ignorance of Islam.   He can't possibly be *that* stupid? Can he?	20
1	Though obvious.....I have to say it.  What if it was a republican.  I'm thinking lead story on network news and more than half the day on CNN and MSNBC.	20
1	God I'm so sick of this shit. Who cares?? I care about his policies. conservatives and liberals have these kinds of gaffs/issues all the time but when they don't concern their policy then *who cares*?	20
1	Jesuits were bitterly opposed to slavery as was Christianity as a whole.	20
1	*police aggressively go after criminals*  **POLICE ARE EVIL WHITE RACISTS!!!1!1! GET THOSE CRACKAS OUT OF OUR HOOD!**  *police stop aggressively policing*  **THE RACIST POLICE HAVE ABANDONED THE BLACK COMMUNITY!**  You can't win with some people...	20
1	I hate Bernie Sanders but really, do we need to dig up stuff from 50 years ago to criticize him about? His beliefs *today* are already bad enough.  That being said, of course the mainstream media would be all over this if a Republican said it.	20
1	Seriously?  Are you going to say that one side "started this" and thus the other side is justified?  The public vetting and absurd campaign process is a arms race that has been going on for *decades*, fueled and participated in heavily by both sides, hoping to cast aspersion on their opponents.  Please, show me any evidence that the Democrats "chose" mud-slinging tactics.	20
1	Aand now it comes full circle.....	20
1	I will bet this is taken out of context	20
1	So, essentially, what he said was politically correct.   Very *progressive*.	20
1	Exactly. Their faction is the reason the GOP nominated McCain, Romney, and is likely to nominate Bush. Thank God they are dying out. Good riddance.   Call me a nut but sometimes I swear there's a Judas element in the GOP that conspires against the electable candidates on a national level.	20
1	I really wish this subreddit was more about talking about conservative policies and how they might work better than than what we have now. Instead it's post after post throwing mud at liberals and Democrats.	20
1	the very opposite of /r/politics	20
1	Obama said "Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business, that, *you didn't build that*. Someone else made that happen."  Immediately all the liberals were claiming that Fox news and other conservative media were taking it out of context.	20
1	must have struck a critical nerve.  Sanderites are out in force.	20
1	I mean, it's even worse WITH context, to be honest	20
1	&gt; Did the union guy finally figure out that he is going to have a bunch of laid off union workers.  No, they'll never realize this. They'll blame it on their company and the leftists will lap it up.	20
1	I could care less if this is taken out of context. If "Ted Cruz Flip-Flops on Government Aid" can make it to the top page of /r/politics with no context, this should stay at the top so the "context doesn't matter" crowd from /r/politics can put some foot in their mouths.	20
1	I don't understand this us vs them mentality. I just love to research headline claims. I am conservative on a number of issues and subscribe here as well as neutral politics. I find sensationalism hilarious and think how seriously people take attention grabbing quotes like this is quite  confounding so when I can bust the bullshit I will.      Always strive for objectivity.	20
1	Aren't we suppose to be better than that slop?	20
1	Uh... no.  Look at the mission statement.  It says very clearly we're not here to debate conservatives. That doesn't disqualify talking about policy, but it also doesn't disqualify talking shit about democrats.	20
1	How tone deaf can Fox possibly be??  The republican brand desperately needs some new blood, someone with some new ideas, not more of the same tired establishment candidates running on the same tired platform.  If I have to watch the republicans destroy one of their own again, I'm voting third party.	20
1	Honestly, that slop is extremely effective.  You can only turn the other cheek for so long before you realize you're getting steamrolled.  Alinsky was a piece of shit, but he knew what he was doing.	20
1	I heard Mitt Romney bullied a kid who might have later come out as gay (but we don't know) when he was in high school.  THAT made the news.	20
1	I saw on my local NBC news channel they cut him out of the poll too.	20
1	You haven't posted a single article to this subreddit. Ever.	20
1	Nope.  She's from Chicago.  She moved to Arkansas of course when she married Bill, but her painfully bad southern accent has always been an affectation.	20
1	This is a political news and current events sub. If you are looking for foundational knowledge on the tenets of conservativism then I would suggest reading a book such as Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto by Mark R. Levin. Most of the regulars on this sub are already familiar with these concepts and therefore the purpose of this sub is not to rehash well established ideas again and again.	20
1	It's being implied that without tax dollars financing infrastructure, businesses would never be able to get off the ground. It's nonsense.	20
1	This illustrates how stupid she thinks voters are.  In her defense, considering the things voters let democrats get away with, she's not exactly wrong....	20
1	Why the hell do they take Donald Trump seriously...	20
1	Haven't been following closely and this is the first I am hearing of this.  In no way should Donald Trump be given serious screentime without Rand Paul. It just doesn't make sense, and it shows intentional bias. There has to be a personal agenda against Rand Paul. I am sick of the media's control over all of this.	20
1	I wonder why Liberals are so anti-science.	20
1	Funny how Democrats overwhelmingly support Big Union who seems intent on hurting society's most vulnerable... immigrants, women, and children.	20
1	Create topics and go at it. The few times I tried to very few people responded. Be the change you want to see. Don't just bitch about it.	20
1	Not Fox, but conservative radio host Michael Medved pisses me off so much. He rips on the Pauls constantly, and whenever he gets called on it, he justifies it by pointing out "the polls". Well, yeah, if the people behind the polls leave them out, and the media who influence the opinion of people who take the polls rip on them like he does...	20
1	This would give union workers an advantage-if they raise minimum wage to $15 and only union employees could work at, say, $10 per hour, businesses would be all but forced to unionize and be beholden to the big unions in the process. Brilliant, but conniving and in my opinion a powergrab by the union bosses.	20
1	And by "Hawks" he means that old decrepit shit named John McCain  "Oh we're only going to arm the MODERATE rebels!!!"  And that stupid bastard STILL wants to arm them. Jesus fuck how to people keep perpetually voting for that clown? FFS......	20
1	The Republican party is fractured into the GOP, the conservatives, and the libertarians. If we can't agree on one strong candidate (cough cough, Rand Paul, cough cough), we'll get eight more years of Alinskyism with Hilary Cunton.	20
1	Jeb is their obvious pick.	20
1	When they find out it doesn't suit their plans for this country.	20
1	Republicans: The party of old white men. /s  Edit: Added /s	20
1	Old people tend to be republican because they have the experience to understand that it is the proper way.   "If you're not a Democrat at 20, you have no heart. If you're not a Republican by 40, you have no brain."	20
1	Not just hard work, but *smart* work.  "Liberal" rhetoric absurdly fantasizes that the hardest-working people are the poorest.  While there are a lot of lower income people who work really hard in dead-end jobs, many people who are middle class and up got there by working their asses off *in ways that pay off in the long term*.  "Liberals" will point to a person who inherited wealth and use that to suggest that "rich" people are generally idle.  There is no logic to be found in that reasoning.	20
1	Such a smart, bright young lady.	20
1	He's also the one that the majority of conservatives want the least. My top picks are Paul and Cruz.	20
1	She's racist and hates poor people!	20
1	Bernie Sanders doesn't need any scandals to not have a chance.	20
1	I've had this discussion on reddit and many have trouble understanding the concept. They say ditch digging is harder than being a CEO, I try to explain that 'hard work' doesn't mean what's *physically* harder, but what job is more difficult. if one requires multiple degrees, then one is harder to do. Since anyone can dig a hole, then ditch digging is not hard work in this sense.	20
1	Years of criticism and arguments during high school and occasionally during college (2015 grad). I still don't regret being a Republican one bit. I just regret everyone else.	20
1	Absolutely disgusting.  I can barely see straight right now.  Donald Sterling losses his entire team yet this lady gets no kind of punishment?  This, in and of itself, is sheer racism.  What can we do to not make this go away?	20
1	I'm 18 and I feel so sorry that so many people my age have a skewed view of the world. It's easy to say "I'm oppressed, give me change and hand me everything" as opposed to actually working yourself and taking personal responsibility.	20
1	Anyone who thinks successful CEOs don't work hard are either lying or have never been around one.	20
1	The issue here is not censorship, it's the selective outrage of the left. Posting a taunt to radical Islamists in our nation's capital puts a bulls-eye in the worst place. The D.C. Metro had to make this call, but it's important to note that no one in the chattering class ever takes precautions or ever goes out of their way to defend against insulting anyone else.  Admittedly a bit ham-handed, Pam is nonetheless making an important point, which is that this is what happens when President Obama decides he'd rather fight the War on Terror on American soil than fight it overseas.	20
1	Imagine if that was a white man saying "kill all black men" or "kill all females" or something of the sorts. They would be gone in an instant.	20
1	That's the worst offense	20
1	Hence they are the dumbest people on the face of the planet.	20
1	Lol what? Do any other countries have an election coming up? Maybe I'll go over there and vote in it.	20
1	We need Batman. Or at least Rorschach.	20
1	Fun fact for those who haven't heard it: the GOP has won the national popular vote just once since 1988, in the 2004 election following September 11. This really will be an opportunity for the Republicans to prove that they can win a race. It is pretty rare for the American people to elect another member of the same party after two terms.	20
1	Thanks for posting. I was searching for this video last night and couldn't find it.  So a black girl throwing on a blonde wig to pretend to be white isn't racist? Do we need to coin a new term like "blonde-facing"?  "How do you feel about racism?" love that the one white guy's answer was "unnoticed." Ha!  Blah blah blah affirmative action isn't a free ride for college scholarships. Fine. Can we talk about the United Negro College Fund?	20
1	No one makes her obey now.	20
1	The age old art of violent hysteria can only be resolved with more violence unless you aspire to become a victim.  Reason has become an unwelcome by by-product to the emotionally charged and intellectually challenged.  We have watched our President, a man charged with protecting our country, stir up racial hatred to the extent that Baltimore is now lawless.  This, in the name of social equity.  Remember who you are and remember the constitution.  And fear not, the only thing we need to fear is fear itself.	20
1	It's not racist, because only white people can be racist./s	20
1	Maybe I haven't lived long enough, but I have never seen a President get up and not support our civil servants.  Not only did he not support them, he threw them under the bus.  He chastised the police more than he did anyone else in Baltimore, including the protestors.  That was very telling and did some serious damage.	20
1	I believe it should be law of the land: the sponsor/s of any legislation that would infringe on any part of the constitution should be criminally charged and be stripped of their position and be permanently banned from any public office.	20
1	You'd think people would read the label when thinking about buying a product.	20
1	&gt;I wonder what else will they make us buy?  "Hate crime" insurance. You must have insurance if you want to speak your unfavorable opinion.	20
1	But let the illegal votes start trending conservative and see how fast the border snaps shut.	20
1	The same people who make Obama obey the law obviously.	20
1	Yeah, if that happened, the border would look like the wall on Game of Thrones, but with high voltage razor wire and a moat with alligators.	20
1	The fact that they try should be worthy of uproar.	20
1	Eh he still seems to excuse Obama for a lot. And will probably end up going for Hillary regardless	20
1	DC is such a prime example of limousine liberalism at its finest. I'm a former resident, and its amazing to see these deluded yuppies harp on how much they care for the poor, and how much  "progress" the corrupt city government is making--all the time sipping lattes in newly-gentrified neighborhoods.	20
1	Hell, if you don't have to be an American to vote, why not mail ballots to everyone in Latin America and let them vote in their own country.	20
1	"It featured a black girl wearing a blonde wig, several school employees and a number of minority students." I can't stop laughing at this image. If they wanted to teach, they should examine the grammer of online news sites.	20
1	Fair point, posting this, but his criticisms are coming from the Left. He feels Obama has compromised too much with Republicans...hardly the view of this sub.	20
1	This guy exemplifies the typical democrat. He thinks he can conclude that Obama is a "quality human being" just from meeting him a "few times." WTF? These people are truly brain damaged.	20
1	Washington, D.C. is such a sad contrast- monuments to the gods of big government and American neoliberalism just blocks away from encampments of homeless veterans. It's a tragedy.	20
1	That was my impression the few times I've been.  It is confusing how anyone living there can look at their policies and conclude that anything they've done was successful.	20
1	Yep, only reason it is not closed currently because the sway D.  So very sad we all know this and yet it continues anyways.  The people really have lost this country, our forefathers are probably and continue to roll in their graves with everything that has happened and continues to happen.	20
1	Shit, don't give 'em ideas...	20
1	When ever a liberal shows disapproval for Obama, I'm always in disbelief that they feel he has compromised and could have done so much more.	20
1	I do have to give them props on the subway system. If only Nashville had one. I could entertain myself all day with that	20
1	Idiots just keep driving the nail deeper and deeper.	20
1	It's because weed is illegal and wiretaps still exist	20
1	Clearly he's subjugated that black man beside him and is a racist.  Does he really need all those trophies?	20
1	Please tell me that this is something the NRA has grossly distorted, because if that's actually the advice they're giving rape victims I feel sick.	20
1	Ted Cruz vs. any Democratic Party candidate in a televised Presidential debate ... It would truly be glorious.	20
1	He's got my vote.	20
1	I remember back in the '80s anti-gunners in the US telling women to get rape whistles instead of guns.	20
1	Can't wait to see him and Rand smoke Hillary and whatever poor idiot the Dems trot out as her running mate.	20
1	In the UK, if you use an old sword or rugby bat to attack an invader in your home, you are at risk of being hit with criminal charges for injuring your attacker.    A farmer jailed for shooting dead a burglar has told how he was too scared to tackle an intruder this week in case he was branded a criminal.

1	What, so someone else will hear and come blow their rape whistle too?	20
1	My rape alarm travels 2,817 fps.	20
1	Any show about people actually achieving something can't help but be conservative, since liberalism these days is all about being offended and finding someone else to blame for your shortcomings.	20
1	I'm really happy that this isn't even that much of a partisan issue anymore.	20
1	No, I'm pretty sure that a $15 minimum wage would hurt plenty of "Ma &amp; Pa" places.  Frankly, it would kill most if not all of the "Ma &amp; Pa" places and leave us with nothing but billion dollar Multinational Corporations who can afford to,replace their minimum wage workers with robots.	20
1	Yeah, If Rand Paul and Ted Cruz could join forces. That'd be great.	20
1	Rick Santorum: "I'd vote for the Patriot Act all over again." Keep that in mind.	20
1	Is anybody else scared of false flag sabotage tactics that could happen if he is credited with sole responsibility? Maybe he gets the nomination and is ahead in the polls...a surprise terrorist attack could change the national conversation pretty quickly for the mainstream media to play the old far and feather game...  For the record, killing the Patriot Act is so insanely necessary, by no means am I saying this shouldnt be done. Just thinking out loud.	20
1	A champion of the Constitution!	20
1	Actually many federal courts have ruled that it is	20
1	Of all the candidates, he seems to be the one pulling in people from both sides of the aisle and isn't afraid to piss off fellow GOP members if need be.	20
1	Except that Cruz supports the domestic spy program.	20
1	I think what sets Paul apart from so many other candidates is that he has what so many (perhaps even most) politicians lack: integrity.	20
1	"This is the British Police!  Stop, or I'll say 'stop!' again!"	20
1	Clearly, I must watch this show now.	20
1	&gt; What's funny (really is sad, but makes me laugh), at liberal echo chambers, almost every time Paul does something, you'll see the comments "I don't agree with Rand, but I agree with him on this."  That shit makes me laugh hard. It's like even when he does something undeniably good they can't just say "good job." They've always got to qualify it. Stuck in their delusions i guess.	20
1	Realistically, is ANYONE planning on voting for Santorum over all of the other candidates?	20
1	I don't see what sector of the population he could get this time, it seems a lot of the national conservatives and social conservatives he had in 2012 are all in Cruz' camp for the most part.	20
1	It's a really good show too!	20
1	In other news, water is wet.	20
1	The integrity is precisely what scares the establishment GOP the most. A Republican who has conservative principles sincerely frightens them.	20
1	$15 an hour for working at McDonald's, people are crazy.  Then I should make around $180,000 a year for working a real job.	20
1	As a liberal coming here to see the other side, you're right. A lot of the people who really support Bernie Sanders (including me) have Rand as their second choice. The only major gripe with him is that he's a little too lenient with corporations. One thing's certain though, we all love his honesty. He's really fighting for his constituents in his recent filibuster, and I can totally respect that.	20
1	He promised much and we should be thankful he couldn't implement all of his agenda.    My favorite re-run, one that he no longer uses, is "This administration will not rest until....fill in the blank"  I guess golf doesn't count as rest.	20
1	Agreed. Starter Jobs. Teach you how to work and conduct yourself appropriately.	20
1	That won't fly on Reddit. Apparently, salting fries is supposed to support a family of four.	20
1	Exactly, this is a job for teenagers learning work ethic, not a career.	20
1	No matter what one thinks of Joe, it's always a terrible thing for a parent to have to see one of their children die at such a young age. Sad.	20
1	My condolences,  Mr. Vice President.	20
1	I'll be honest I didn't know he had children.	20
1	he had four.   The one who just died (Beau) and another (Hunter) were in a car accident that killed his daughter and wife. Joe then remarried and had another daughter.   His son who just died had a decent shot at being the next Governor of Delaware before he was diagnosed with Brain Cancer :-/.   I can't imagine what the VP is going through, having to bury a second child.    Edit added punctuation.	20
1	It's so refreshing to see people on this subreddit putting aside their partisanship in the name of basic human decency. Y'all deserved to be commended.   Of course my thoughts and prayers are with the VP and his family.	20
1	Prayers for the Biden family during this difficult time.	20
1	No parent should ever have to bury their child, much less two. May he rest in peace.	20
1	He will be in my thoughts and prayers tonight :(	20
1	No matter what anyone thinks of him, he's a man who must be going through hell right now, and my prayers are with him and his family.	20
1	According to the FBI it's been 0 so far.	20
1	Thanks to the mods for keeping this post here. Many of us don't subscribe to /r/politics or /r/news for the obvious reasons.	20
1	Then that's their problem.	20
1	Seconded. I've never heard of them before, and never saw them with him.   Regardless, may he rest easy.	20
1	IMO he was a shoe-in to win the governorship in 2016.  It's very sad to see a young man with a family die under such tragic circumstances. I hope his relatives can find peace in this very difficult time.	20
1	Unfortunate for him to lose another family member, especially at 46. RIP Beau Biden.	20
1	he was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2013.  he initially went into remission but it came back earlier this past spring.	20
1	Jesus dude this was a person, what if somebody was saying this about your kid?	20
1	It's scary to me how many don't.  16% don't think there should be presidential term limits? Really?	20
1	What is wrong with you?  I completely disagree with everything both of them stood for but I do not wish misery like the death of a family member on anybody.  And how you somehow draw a link between his death and issues regarding gun rights is a pretty impressive feat of imagination I must say.	20
1	Holy shit that is such an inhuman, sociopathic thing to say.	20
1	First of all Biden is pretty powerless in government. Second of all, it's incredibly fucked up to say that he deserved it because of the fact that he is pro gun control	20
1	His son also served in Iraq.	20
1	He is a master debater.	20
1	&gt;he is more or less saying 'can you believe what this guy just said?'  Yeah, that!	20
1	One could say he's a master at it.	20
1	I think there's a difference between *disagreeing with a nation's policies* and *racism against people with Jewish heritage*.  To argue that anybody, even America's most important ally in the middle east, is above criticism is a dangerous policy to hold.	20
1	No one should have to bury a child. Politics can get very personal and heated very fast, but we must remember pretty much every person acts in ways that they honestly believe is for the best. The world is not black and white, but rather a spectrum of gray. No matter the views of your opponent, we must remember they are human, trying their best. I would not wish this on my bitterest enemy, much less on someone I don't see eye to eye with.	20
1	Currently a debater on the same circuit. Just to clarify, it's best in the nation, not world. And that's a bit misleading since APDA is really only an organization in the northeast.  Don't mean to discredit anything he did, the circuit (as my flair suggests) has a huge liberal bias so that much success from a conservative is even more impressive imo.	20
1	I had a professor in college who was a hardcore liberal. I didn't find out in class, it was after class and I saw him at the grocery store and we had a conversation about politics that I found out about his views. He taught world government and you couldn't guess his views just by being in his class. He was unbiased, bi-partisan, and that's the way it should be for ALL teachers.	20
1	People have gone to jail for far less than what she's done and she's got a decent shot of being our next President.	20
1	You are scum. He served our country in the military.	20
1	Sharia Law is currently the biggest threat to freedom and liberty in the world. It is a disgusting excuse for religious ideology, but being disguised as such allows it's general acceptance by liberals.	20
1	Dude you're comparing Joe Biden's son with Hitler, and calling everyone else idiots?	20
1	Uh, Global warming WILL kill us all. Shit like this makes me want to unsub. This is basic science, it has nothing to do with left or right wing ideology.	20
1	&gt; 1. The earth's temperature has risen over the last century.  Should it?  Or are we assuming a constant?  I have yet to hear someone tell me how warm it "should" be.  Assuming a constant isn't science.  I don't see why everyone can't stick to science.	20
1	God damn it people. I am a pretty conservative person, but why do we have to politicize science. I'm with you people when it comes to tumblr feminist professors pushing their agendas on people who are forced to take these classes to get their degree, but this is science. Humans are going to get fucked by Global Warming.	20
1	Source that confirms global warming, as we currently understand it, "WILL kill us all", please.  No credible study has ever claimed such a ridiculous fear-mongering hypothesis.	20
1	It's crazy, full blown crazy how much politics loves this piece of shit	20
1	I think it's a good idea to have term limits for congress.  90% of congress gets re-elected today but in the first 100 years of the country's history the average rate was 57%.  There's too much careerism.	20
1	That is just not how science works at all. There is indisputable evidence that global warming is happening, and 97% of climate scientists, who study the atmosphere for their living, agree that we are the cause of it. Please stop hindering humanity with this dermatologist bullshit.	20
1	I will never understand how he is gaining steam in the race. He's a lunatic with far left ideals that would make America a communist utopia.	20
1	Even if you do believe in it, it's not the immediate threat they claim it to be, and no amount of money shoveled into the government will fix it.	20
1	Hersay. When the public actually hears him open his mouth he'll disappear.	20
1	He has said things and some of my Facebook friends are fangirling/fanboying over the fact that he is so tough on those undeserving rich people, yet one can hope they'll see how unrealistic his views are.	20
1	I do debate. That means I spend time critically evaluating my own opinions and having to defend ones I don't have. I'd like to think this makes me understanding of my own viewpoints and those of others. I'm not gonna waste more time getting upset about this, [I'll just link you to a thread where a liberal person was displaying the same self-righteous attitude you are, and how you reacted](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/360iu0/stephanopoulos_pulls_out_of_debate_after_clinton/cra1hje)  Edit: Lol just read the comment again. I'm a CS major but glad you've figured out that my views have been forced on me by my Database Design professor	20
1	Lets stop funding universities that disagree with any conservative message!    This is the kind of crap liberals try to pull.	20

While this may be great news to those of like minds, the science doesn't support such bans. As it turns out, there is only a negligible time difference in having a standard capacity mag and many lower capacity mags in rate of fire. This in turn removed $80million from the economy and caused in excess of 200 jobs to leave the state. It was all due to scientifically unsound, feel good, California style legislation.	20
0	If Canada started building suburbs south of their border, I doubt we'd take it well.   And Iran is cooperating with us on a level we haven't seen in a long time. It isn't great but it's something. Yet Israel is talking shit and asking us to back them up. Meanwhile we're in joint military operations with Iran to fight ISIS.	20
0	The declaration of independence has zero laws in it. None. Plus, creator is obviously vague on purpose.   The Constitution enumerates our rights, the first amendment going against at least 4 commandments, and there is zero mention of a god on it. None.	20
0	The police should stand down.  The whole point of the protests is to provoke confrontation with police, loot, and score victimBux.    Just let the rioters/protesters go crazy and create chaos.  Once society is back on the side of the police then they can go in and do their jobs without being political pawns for Obamas SJW army.	20
0	Eh, you'd be surprised at how many people don't wear their seatbelts (NOTE TO ALL:  Wear your seatbelt please!).  Still, no one severs their spine.  Mind you, in this case there wasn't even a car crash...at best we had a "rough ride".  Completely perplexed, I won't lie.	20
0	lol have you been on social media lately?  Last I heard there was a "wholesale slaughter" of blacks by cops going on.	20
0	I'm quoting John McCain who was quoting key generals and military leaders.	20
0	Dude, I came here to see what was being said about Bernie and just started talking to people. I've been a subscriber to /r/SandersForPresident for a long while and a lefty social democrat for years (in one form or another).	20
0	No worries. I actually recognized your username so I searched your comment history and we commented on a lot of the same stuff over there.	20
0	I'm glad our standard for government is "Look at all the times they didn't kill someone without just cause"	20
0	You needn't worry about Bernie, he's everything Democrats hate. Old, white and male.  Essentially he'll become a victim of his own "progressive ideas".	20
0	I love Rush. He's always trolling the Left.	20
0	But that was for a good cause.	20
0	Would I be fair in assuming that one should not "count Bernie out?"	20
0	Stalin would be jealous of the SJW mobs who aim their Two Minutes of Hate on all who commit Thoughtcrime that goes against the Party.	20
0	Bernie Sanders?  Economic populism is usually a tool of charlatans not liberators.	20
0	None dare call it treason.	20
0	It shocks me that somebody advocating aspects of socialism being "worked into Democracy" got 52 likes on /r/conservative.  It also shocks me that a post bashing anti-Soviet "propaganda" got 52 likes on /r/conservative.  I really thought that conservatives knew better than to buy into the contemporary trend of bashing the necessities of Cold War politics.	20
0	Socialism is more like sugar.  It's tempting and sweet to children, it's full of empty calories and it's poisonous to your health in large doses.	20
0	Europe is like that guy you know who owns a nice car and goes on extravagant vacations because his lives with his parents rent-free.	20
0	Well I think a big issue here is that there are plenty of solutions that fix problems in an effective manner that would be implemented in a way that would disgust liberty loving people.	20
0	I take socialists personally because their entire belief system is predicated on the idea that they know better and feel they have the right to regulate my life and liberty often without limit.	20
0	Does anybody else turn red with anger/frustration when they hear an amateur political scientist declare, "communism isn't bad in theory!" or is that just me?	20
0	Typically, the world gets better one funeral at a time. It seems in this instance the opposite is the case.	20
0	None of that is rooted in personal experience though, it's gotten from rappers, movie stars, etc.   I would dare them to start listing specific examples of times where they felt the media was incompetent, corrupted, pandering, you'd have dead air.  This new generation is even worse than the boomers in that, they don't even trust people who are supposed to be trust worthy or honest (Cronkite, etc), they trust those who they think are likable and cool (Jon Stewart).  It's a third hand account, which is incredibly dangerous.	20
0	The two things the lying left fears the most, time and the truth, is taking its toll on their religious belief in global warming.	20
0	I am quite sure dismouthing moore would have a far more positive effect towards keeping the peace than neutering the nations law enforcement.	20
0	Of course she did. There is 0% chance that she would ever live in that neighborhood.	20
0	Obama is more effective at destroying minority communities while he's in DC.	20
0	Those countries have at most 9 million people, more realistically about 5, a much smaller Gdp, a much larger government, and a lot less responsibilities on the world stage. They're not super powers, and most of their military protection comes from the U.S. Just because something works moderately well with at most 9 million people, doesn't mean it's going to work nearly as well with 318.9 million people. And as far as we know, it's not sustainable. Those countries could be bankrupt in 30 years because they spend too much and guarantee too much to their populace that they can't afford come an economic recession or depression.	20
0	Democrats? Hell, half of them probably think "socialism" means using facebook and twitter.	20
0	It will be interesting to watch sanders get beat like he stole something. The leftists are butthurt over campaign finance or trade deals? Well now they have a true socialist to vote for. Let's see how far sanders gets with his 'Americans are victims' platform.	20
0	I hereby pledge to stand in solidarity against this assault on Italian-American culture!	20
0	Shocks me too. Reveals how successful the school system has been at "mind-conditioning" us to accept belonging to a hive rather than being free.	20

0	The underground economy is doing very well. Thank you so much, Socialists, for helping to keep that money out of the governments filthy claws.	20
0	No person on earth has lived during said period. The last chance was millions of years ago.	20
0	Because young people don't believe bullshit?	20
0	I love your comment so much had to reply twice, can you tell us about the time you lived through a period of intense heating or cooling?	20
0	Yes exactly, but this appears to be the exception to the rule.	20

0	They did have plenty of other opportunities.	20
0	Like I said before in many places I bet he's a good guy. But I vote on policy and I don't buy his policy arguments. I also don't think Vermont conservatives are quite like the conservatives in SC or TX.	20
0	Here's your chance, leftists. Do leftists really hate campaigns funded by billionaires? If so, sanders will win the democratic primary. However I'm betting sanders will get beat like he stole something.	20
0	Obama supporters don't have to pay taxes. However anyone not loyal to obama must face government prosecution.	20
0	So do you suggest we have an extremist government instead that isn't paralyzed and can do whatever it wants?  No.  The perfect balance is both sides unhappy so that we stay closer to the middle.  But not so unhappy as they turn on there handlers.	20
0	Oh look another armchair general who knows everything and looks down on anyone with a dissenting opinion as an imposter. At least now I know it's not worth trying to explain my position any further. Thanks.	20
0	Capitalism is a system of private ownership of the means of production.  Socialism is a system of worker ownership of the means of production.  The two CANNOT coexist.	20
0	Even the libs know the global warming scam is about played out.  I'm sure however that they are well on their way in developing the next eco-socialism based "catastrophe" that can only be solved with the dismantling of what is left of our free market system.	20
0	&gt;“Why,” he asks, “can’t two consenting people make arrangements for less than x dollars per hour?”   Because the power disparity between employers and low-skill workers would create a permanent, miserable and easily exploitable underclass.  Retail space is competitive in SF. If a print media shop with a staff of one can't move enough product in 2015, then another business that employs more people might be better for the local economy.	20
0	Ok, so tell me personal story from that period.	20
0	A good argument for raising the minimum wage federally, it seems. All the benefits without those imaginary drawbacks.	20
0	Nothing but shamelessly dishonest left-wing propaganda from the media.  It's truly tragic how powerful these neocommunists have become.	20
0	but those could be his sons for gods sake	20
0	&gt; Killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person.   I disagree there. It's killing.  &gt; Very often it is not wrong at all.  I agree there, depending on the disability. If it's retarded, kill it because it is useless.	20
0	Source? We have 119 years of recorded data. Everything else is projections much like when then they project tomorrows weather.	20
0	Adjusted to today's dollar that's about $8 or $9. Unless you lived in San Fran at the time I'm willing to bet your $8 dollars an hour went further than $12 does in San Fran. That's what you have to pay just to park your car for a couple hours.	20

0	Wow thats sickening.  How is anyone supposed to believe conservatives value of civil rights and freedom from government tyranny when police murders are simple jokes?  Is this really something we should be joking about?	20
0	If you work 40 hours you should be able to not worry about eating or having shelter...if that can't be met then welfare is a better option as you may still just make ends meet but at least you have free time. We don't need straight up communism, but we need to start acting like people are people and not worker drones to be taken advantage of.	20

0	The media loves calling Ted Cruz 'far right', but you never hear them refer to Bernie as 'far left'.  Then again his views are pretty middle of the road these days given how far left the dems have become.	20
0	I think their desire is to more to get votes than to help.	20
0	Yep, and then when they are found not guilty the tards will be wailing nad gnashing their teeth screaming 'no justice no peace' again.  We know them better than they know themselves.	20
0	Socialism - the notion that I am required by law to pay for the well-being of people I have never met. Yep, I'm 100% opposed to this policy.	20
0	&gt; Are you serious? The reason the ozone isn't destroyed is because was pretty much stopped the use of CFCs worldwide. The ozone layer was developing a huge hole, we stopped using CFCs and try to limit other chemicals that destroy the ozone layer  Being a mechanic with a certification in Heating and AC systems I have a technical question for you.  How do heavier than air gases float up into the stratosphere ?  By the way some interesting reading for you, [Ozone and Freon Fraud](http://www.sweetliberty.org/issues/environment/ozonefreon_fraud.htm#.VUO9zflViko)	20
0	Yep. It also seems a bit too quick to actually know all the fact but I guess the attorneys here don't need all of them.	20
0	they never talk about bernie at all. im sure that now hes in the race they will refer to how far left of hillary he is.	20
0	Whats to discuss ?  Oh thats right, you are a tard, you think being charged signifies guilt,, unless the one 'charged' happens to be a jackass party member, black, illegal invader, or gay, at which point they must be deemed innocent by ideology.	20
0	jeez, bro. quit perpuating black stereotypes. /s	20
0	&gt; Some thugs wear blue.  However the majority of them prefer black.	20
0	I bet the idea is that $50 benefit accrues to a private interest, and you only have access to that state largess (i.e. Being the owner of a business that can "underpay" (in this example)) if you have made it to a certain level of wealth. If this were an unmitigated "good" for society to support already well off people, then we should proceed with policies like this vigorously. But maybe, just maybe- it isn't.	20
0	This is what happens when you let idiots run the asylum. Everyone with common sense and a freshman level business course knows this is the outcome when you force businesses to increase pay. Did we warn them repeatedly? yes. Did they listen? no. Are they going to cause more harm than good as usual? yes. Will they learn from their mistakes? not likely.	20
0	How does a person get another job when there are more workers than jobs? Why have taxpayers pay the difference for a livable wage when a minimum wage forces the patrons of the business to?   Where does this labor force go?	20
0	So why don't we make proper sex education in schools mandatory?  Why don't we make contraception widely available?	20
0	obviously they're "innocent until proven guilty", i'm just genuinely interested to hear what defenders of the police will have to say. let me just ask you, do you really think the cops didn't do anything to freddie gray? do you buy the story that freddie gray intentionally hurt himself? did the cops have probable cause? just wondering what your position is.	20
0	CVS store gets burned to the ground, libs dont give a shit, Comic Book store in danger of closing, tards go berzerk !	20
0	I have stated from the outset, we do not know all the facts yet.  As for the career criminal, I can well imagine he deserved what he got.	20
0	Ah, thank you for the kind words.  Still raise the prices and stay open! A sign or two, sticky notes to explain the higher prices.... Not that hard!	20
0	If you had to guess...	20
0	As the article indicated and Simon articulates very well was that his initial reforms were good. But that was not enough for him and he proceed to wipe his ass with the Constitution. The article shows me that omalley has no regard for individual liberty and is willing to do whatever it takes to get elected.	20
0	i'm not condoning freddie gray running away, or his criminal past, but the van ride is what makes the cops look guilty. freddie gray slips into coma after suffering severe spinal injuries and dies. trauma experts and doctors...EXPERTS and DOCTORS...have come out and said that freddie gray couldn't have done this to himself in the van, yet he died from spinal injuries. so if freddie gray didn't cause his own spinal injuries, then who did?   is there yet hard evidence or footage demonstrating the cops broke freddie gray's spine? no. so sure, we can say we don't know, but...c'mon, lol.	20
0	Besides the murdering part, that sounds pretty good.	20
0	Yeah, I could have assumed	20
0	I've called every single one of these incidents, logic always prevails.	20
0	You would be subsidizing far more if the job did not exist.  But to tackle that argument more directly benefits tend to inflate wages as the rewards for doing nothing are greater thus lessening the marginal rewards for working.  The short answer is that the idea has zero basis in reality.	20
0	You must be some medical expert in order to know everything about the nature of someone's injuries thousands of miles away and without even seeing x-rays, CT scans or performing the autopsy. Why are you wasting your diagnostic skills arguing with a stranger on the Internet. You should be saving lives in Nepal from your chair in presumably the US.	20
0	Will I be making money if you pay me $10? I'll need transportation, something to put the excrement into, food to replace the energy used, wear and tear on my clothing, etc.  How does a wage floor create four wage levels?  If you can't even break even on a job, why would you do it?	20
0	What is the lowest wage you could live on?	20
0	The coward who posted two reports, against the very purpose of reporting, ought to have a little more courage and actively make his point.  No one is saying that justice shouldn't done, but it's been less than a week, right? That's just to fast to be announcing homicide charges.	20
0	But as other reports have said, his neck injury was consistent with a bolt protruding from the inside of the van. Now I'm no medical genius, but it's possible that even a low velocity impact of say someone throwing themselves against the walls of a van that happen to hit a bolt at the right spot could cause an injury that could sever someone's cervical spine. After all, P = F / area. And in this instance, the force of an adult body in motion is relatively large and the area of a bolt is pretty small, which could produce a very large pressure on that area.	20
0	It sounds like a Dave Chappelle joke.	20
0	&gt;that we would have no ozone lair...  Yeah, no scientist ever said that.	20
0	I see no reason he can't expand into the gaming(tabletop) market.  Most comic book shops have to so they can stay in business as it is.  I know a shop that rents another space just for the gamers to have a place to play and that rent is paid for in only magic the gathering revenue.  Right now board gaming is exploding.  Its a great time to expand.	20
0	Because everyone knows prosecutors HATE cops.  Get real.	20
0	Sounds like a great opportunity for you to do some research on your own.  Let us know what you find!	20
0	I agree, but that seems irrelevant in this case of a liberal prosecutor sacrificing police officers with bullshit **murder** charges for greater social justice and to appease race baiters.	20
0	The fact nobody knows, tells me they are probably black.	20
0	We'll see about that.	20
0	And you are WRONG.  He has already gone public and has now changed his story.	20
0	Its all about race man.  The prosecutor is black, and the officers white, this is obviously a hate crime !	20
0	So now you're generalizing.  I thought that kind of stereotyping was EEVVVVILLLL in you libs' eyes	20
0	What you call "holding them accountable" I call "filing murder charges despite having no evidence." Cops are also citizens with a right to due process and its clearly being violated to placate the mob.	20
0	Yeah, he comes across to me to be a real reliable trustworthy source of information,/s  I actually posted the article that discloses this earlier, however the tard hate maggots are to stupid to read beyond the first three words of an article so they did not see it.  EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS FOR TARDS: open the linky, progress to the bottom of the article.  If that is still beyond your capabilities, your on your own idiots.

0	I guess it just depends on what happens.  Everyone can save this link and then later if it stays open one group can say "Told ya so" or if it ends up closing the other group can say "Told ya so."	20
0	Because coming to a conclusion like that requires basing your opinion off of logic, instead of emotion.	20
0	Maybe if they were interested in having a discussion about it, they would.	20
0	You're gross, man	20
0	&gt;Freddie Gray sustained his fatal injuries inside a police van when his head slammed into a bolt in the back of the vehicle.  From [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/30/baltimore-police-van-freddie-gray-stop).  I'm not saying that he definitely sustained the injury from the bolt by throwing himself against the walls, but from a purely physical perspective, a man can throw himself against a wall just as hard as if he were thrown by someone else or thrown against the wall from a "rough ride." The idea that the nature of his injury only points to one preconceived cause, as you are claiming, is based on nothing but speculation and prejudice.	20
0	Hey now, dont be mean.  I'm just one of those guys who when given lemons, makes a margarita.	20
0	The weight of the vehicle is irrelevant unless you're claiming that Gray was struck by the van. And hitting the brakes (even rapidly) isn't really that much of an acceleration, unless you think people fly out the windows from braking rapidly and not wearing seat belts. And yeah, if a person threw himself against a wall, he could generate the same amount of energy as someone hitting the front of a van if it braked quickly.  That's like saying football players can't generate enough energy to give themselves concussions, especially since they're wearing helmets that pad their heads.	20

0	/r/politics has always been infested with liberals for a long time. Sure, it used to be a good subreddit to talk about politics way way early in the day (I'd say from 2007 to 2008, assuming if they existed back then).  Then, when reddit started to get really popular (especially when people started to flee Digg and use reddit instead in 2010), it became the liberal hellhole you see today. If you try to a post an opinion that is conservative or Republican in general, they'll mass downvote you.	20
0	Yes.  Wanting dirty cops to be held responsible means I hate cops.  You caught me.  Good job.	20
0	No I am asking for proof or a source that we have been tracking weather for more than 119 years which we haven't. You can sell me on your magic just like the weather man telling me tomorrows weather but still no one knows exactly what temp was. Never mind down to a percent of a degree 2 billion years Ago.	20
0	And they do work. But guess what? $12.50 in San Francisco is poverty. When business owners don't pay their workers enough, they need government benefits to get by. If it's just one business, in an entire city.. That's not bad at all.	20

0	Baltimore cops should g n strike.  Come at me liberal brigaders	20
0	They're definitely always overwhelmingly liberal (that's why it was removed as a default), but it really cranks up to 11 during the election cycle.  They'll lambast politicians in general, but once elections come around, they all line up on the left.	20
0	This may be the only time in history that leftist are ok with someone carrying a weapon on them. Their hypocrisy is so fucking astounding.	20
0	&gt; The officers were charged because that's the way our system works, not to placate a mob.  I wouldn't be too sure about that.  It's pretty obvious the officers were grossly overcharged, given the prosecutor's statement of probable cause.  And if you listen to her speech, she sides with the protesters and claims that it is "our moment".  I wasn't aware that it was the prosecutor's job to politicize a case.	20
0	You had a good economics book. I'm pretty sure mine said the higher the minimum wage is the more rainbows and unicorns there will be.	20
0	Sure.  Look up "The Moynihan Report."  He predicted it all in 1965.  Cheers.	20

0	The only good kinds of socialists are dead ones.	20
0	Liberal high school / professor?  What does that kind of assumption get you?  Is it for your own peace of mind?  Does the fact that I went to a private Christian school in Georgia, and then on to the university of Dallas somehow change how you view anything I wrote?   Education teaches objectivity, logic, and reason.  Failing to use these tools would be an affront to my years of learning.   The founding fathers intentionally established a secular nation. To say otherwise is to insult their intelligence and sacrifice.	20

0	Don't play dumb and ask for extraneous details. The burden is on anyone asking to disprove the following:  If the city has been under Democrat leadership for fifty years, yet Baltimore is the opposite of prosperous. Political leaders/Public offices and their respective governing styles claim to be able to deliver prosperity to their citizens, why is this not happening in Baltimore?   The leadership and policies of Baltimore are under question here..  Or maybe you can explain why Baltimore's Democratic-party governing style is not to blame for Baltimore's lack of prosperity.	20
0	Just google it yourself if you don't believe it don't sit around waiting for someone else to do the work for you, then blame your ignorance on other. This is why liberals are so naive they have to have everything spoon fed to them ugh.	20
0	The "malice" was in all probability meant to injure, not murder.  The charges were meant to appease the crowd; it will be hard to prove intent but easy to prove negligence.	20
0	the government is at fault..er...not really. lets keep spending thousands of dollars for kids in school for no apparent reason.	20
0	So you propose we just let them be unable to afford basic necessities as cost of living (rent, groceries) go up? They're 40 and made some mistakes so just punish them to the point that they're starving and homeless?	20
0	Don't pretend this is an evidence thing.  You know damn good and well what I meant.	20
0	And the jury will. I read your narrative of events. You failed to include anything that would substantiate a murder charge. What happened during that shirt time between riding the bike and the injury. Sorry, but our judicial system needs more than that. Likewise, breaking protocols is not the same as breaking the law. That could open them up to department duscipline and civil charges, but not criminal prosecution.   In short, the defense will have a field say with what gas been presented this far and those cheering today will be pissed a short time from now because of prosecutorial overreach.	20
0	Looks like freddies demise was just another black on black issue.	20
0	The experts say it's unlikely, not impossible. Jumping ability is not lateral movement ability. 7 mph is a jog. Even if you use 4mph, the force concentrated on such a small surface area is still quite significant.   I'm not saying the self-harm story is likely. I'm only saying it's not impossible. I'm more than willing to let the facts of this case play out. I just think it's too soon and we don't know enough of the facts to definitively claim knowledge of the truth.	20
0	&gt; you've been watching too much Sean Hannity  Thanks for the demonstration of "liberal" thought-stopping phrases. lol  She's either scheming as I described or she's an imbecile, obviously you favor the second explanation.	20

0	But there's no comic book cartel that will have you murdered in your sleep, unlike debeers etc.	20
0	I'm sure they will follow the evidence. If just like to know what the hell that evidence is other than He was fine earlier and then he wasn't. Nothing that says intent to kill someone there. A seatbelt doesn't say that. And we don't e en know that it was an illegal arrest until we know what the officers knew -- like if they knew about the active warrant for Gray.	20

0	As he should've. I don't think that is unreasonable. Why would a president encourage the opposite? Today is not the day of the Whiskey Rebellion or Ohio State. The National Guard is fine and dandy, they do us all a great service, but restraint on the side of the government, federal and state, is what is necessary *right now.* Our government exists to give fair order. With that said, I don't think President Obama's comment was out of line.	20

0	Given the statement of probable cause, there isn't even a case for manslaughter in my opinion unless additional evidence is presented.  The only points against the officers are that they didn't buckle him in (which hadn't been policy until 9 days prior) and that they didn't provide medical assistance fast enough - despite the fact that he had been asking for it starting as soon as he was arrested - before he hit his head.  There is definitely a case to be made that this was a case of the boy crying wolf, especially given his questionable character.	20

Some people see black people and automatically view them as lesser, so when they do something that is basic and common, its impressive to them. Others view white people as privileged, so when a white person does something, it better be damned amazing for them to consider it noteworthy.  I don't do that, everyone is on the same plane. Regardless of who they are and what they did. Is it clear at this point?	20

Obviously it could not be because of his race, in fact the officer charged with murder is black.  So why would they deliberately kill freddie ?  Because he was a career criminal and they all agreed it was his day to go ?  Do you honestly believe that ?	20
0	Whoever had the responsibility of handling Freddie Gay was a true American hero.	20
0	so a little less than half (59) of the deaths are by people actively trying to kill them.  About the same number (50) involve motor vehicles (accidental and intentional assault, though mostly (40 of 50) accidental).  But to the broader point the original article alludes to, even if the numbers are open to interpretation, policing is an inherently dangerous occupation, and law enforcement deserves some sympathy.	20
0	&gt;  I don't trust the government.  And with that my friend we have found common ground.

If he *did* vote for the new minimum wage, then it's fair to attack him. If he didn't vote for it, it's probably because he's too lazy to vote because he's 25 and working a minimum wage job.

0	In Odessa, Tx, the starting pay at Pizza Hut is $15/hr. Employment there is/was high stakes due to the oil industry. So clearly that pay isn't enough to cripple a business on its own.  Not that it matters anyway, the real problem isn't how much minimum wage is, it's that there are people who are perpetually working minimum wage positions that can't move up for some reason. We need to find out why, not band-aid it with a rate hike.	20

That being said if I was somehow pregnant and past the deadline for abortions I certainly wouldn't commit infanticide. But I live in a world where a) the baby would be adopted and b) I don't have to choose between my health and the baby's. Don't see why I shouldn't acknowledge that and don't see why I should feel morally superior to some people in Pakistan because of that. But then again, I'm a big believer in moral luck.	20

0	Not every news agency.  Here's one report saying it was spring assisted - http://news.yahoo.com/freddie-gray-death-really-illegal-carry-knife-city-212248392.html and another http://www.wdsu.com/national/the-big-questions-about-freddie-grays-death/32504600  I think that at this point the best anyone can say is it's disputed exactly what the knife is.  But even if it's not spring assisted, the probably cause issue comes into play.  Police can make mistakes on the reasons for an arrest.  It often happens and suspects are freed.  So the prosecutor will have to prove they knowingly performed a false arrest.  How do you prove they didn't simply make a mistake?  IMO those charges will not get past the grand jury.	20
0	I agree, it's not a switchblade.  However it *may* be a spring assisted pocket knife, and that falls under the contraband rules in the city of Baltimore which is more restrictive on knives than the Maryland state law which was cited by the prosecutor.  IMO regarding the arrest only, the worst that will happen to the police is that it will be declared a mistaken arrest and not an illegal one.  Read http://legalinsurrection.com/2015/05/freddie-grays-knife-why-is-prosecutor-claiming-unlawful-arrest/ and you'll see why.

Rampant unemployment reaching 9%, just in 2013 the unemployment rate for black between 20-24 was 37%(!). This city will receive ZERO sympathy from me, the council has 12 DEMOCRATIC COUNSELORS, NOT.ONE.REPUBLICAN. Perhaps the citizens of Baltimore would have been better off with some bipartisanship? Instead the cops are vilified for the failed democratic policies the city has instituted the last 50 years.	20

0	&gt;you can't deny that the literal objective of planned parenthood is to prevent children from growing up in broken homes. I think we can all agree that's good for society.  Once again, like all abortion debates, it comes down to if you believe the unborn is a human being with a right to life.  Running around murdering 2 year olds with absent fathers in poor, violent neighborhoods will also reduce the number of children growing up in broken homes and probably reduce welfare spending because of the statistical long odds these kids face.  I doubt as a society we would call that a good thing.	20
0	You are correct. He has some reading to do.	20
0	Duh - you don't get a check every month for having an abortion...	20
0	Welfare removed the need for a husband. If you are getting 200 per month per kid, why would you get married to the jerkoff that makes ZERO per month that impregnated you?	20
0	No...The objective of Planned Parenthood "THEY don't want you to know about!^^®" is the one laid out by it's founder, Margaret Sanger, a racist progressive eugenist. It is to reduce the "inferior" black population through abortions. It is called the Negro Project, and it has ben quite successful. That is why, still, to this day, most PP offices are in urban areas. And why most babies aborted since 1976 have been black.	20
0	Gut? Where? Please cite an example? And by "gut" do you mean the act of merely stopping perverts from teaching 9 year olds about ingesting semen like they tried to do in Massholechusetts back in 2000? Or gay/lesbian propaganda for kindergarteners? I looked into this. it is insidious, it is deliberate, and it is political, just like everything else the left gets its shitty hands on.	20
0	It gets a god dammed BILLION dollars, most of it taxpayer money. With all due respect, You gotta start looking into these issues before you start commenting on them.	20
0	No it is not. Google "Negro Project Margaret Sanger" and you will see the reasons PP exists.   EDIT: I have responded to you about three times. I apologize--I was not singling you out. I do not look at the names-just the comments.	20
0	With Dr. Ben Carson running, I completely expect to hear Liberals refer to him as an Uncle Tom for as long as he is in the race.	20

0	It's just internalized racism and white supremacy, silly.	20
0	If there are, this doesn't nearly reach that level of "inciting hatred:"  South Park callously marks Christianity all the time; they glory in their blasphemy.  The atheists say the most hateful and inciting things here against Christians all the time, right here on Reddit.  This is no worse than either of those things.  It just happens to be out in the open, rather than on a TV screen, or posted on reddit.  The only difference is that it's not the normal "inciting" against the Christians, but against the protected class of radical Islamists.	20

0	What's the point? A person who throws water on a fire can't be blamed for starting the fire.	20
0	You can't pay people to accept police racism.. LOL.. the two issues are not linked   the city burned because the cops arrested a guy for no reason, put him in a van, drove around for a while, and then the guy turned up with a broken spine and head and neck injuries and he died.  People weren't rioting because they didn't have enough tax breaks.. LOL  Get a crip folks	20
0	I am not trying to explain it away.  I literally said "There is no justification for what these men were planning".  But, when you do things to intentionally piss off a group of people you have to expect backlash.  We all know what to expect as backlash from these "radical" Islamist. They jump straight to violence.  No excusing, no explaining, no justification.  Just not shocked at all because these people poked the bear.	20
0	&gt; There is no justification for what these men were planning  Again, there is no justification for their plans/actions. But you know when you intentionally piss off a group of people there is going to be backlash.  These men just decided to jump straight to violence.	20
0	I think the general idea was preventative medicine would result in less emergency room visits? Not sure how to read the results though. If people are going in for actual emergencies that are sudden it could be symptomatic of a bigger issue. Either that or people are still waiting due to high deductibles and copays. Lowering those is prohibitively difficult though.	20
0	I'm sure you have evidence to suggest otherwise.	20
0	I don't condone these attacks, but they were ABSOLUTELY asking for this.  Imagine if you will, a drawing contest for say, caricatures of Jewish rabbis, or how about this, Jesus Christ, sponsored by Muslims.  How do you think that might play out?  Is it legal?  You betcha!  Is it is offensive and stupid?  You betcha!  Just like this here draw Mohammed event.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.	20
0	Honestly, I'd find it sadder if someone murdered you than if someone murdered baby.	20
0	Your excuse does not change the truth. He does not really accept freedom of speech.  edit: There are no limits on free speech. There are consequences for speech. Yelling fire in a crowded theater has consequences.   Now comes the million dollar question: Do you think that the consequences of drawing a mahammed cartoon should be death?	20
0	By replacing the revenue that they would have generated.	20
0	Catholics as a whole/majority? I would be very shocked.  A singular or pair of Catholics, wouldn't be to shocking.  Every group is going to have a fringe element that isn't all there.  It just happens to be much larger in the Islamic community.  They literally teach those who insult the prophet Mohamed deserve to die.  You have a group, you know how they are going to respond to specific insults and yet, we volley those insults. Then when they UNJUSTIFIABLY yet instinctively react violently, as we expected them to, we scream "freedom of speech" and claim the moral high ground.	20
0	Never got your grade 10 did you?	20
0	Even justifying anger and outrage over a damn drawing or a cartoon is silly. There's no justification to even get slightly butthurt over a cartoon.   You're clearly justifying Islamist terrorist's anger. My reading comprehension is just fine, thank you. For example, I know where the little button on the right-hand side of the page is that says 'ban users'.	20
0	Pack it up folks, this well heeled white man figured it all out for us!  No racism here.  He *knows* what the unrest was all about.	20
0	Don't care: by raising the question, plenty of stupid people are going to think that this falls under some sort of chimeric "inciting" clause and is therefore illegal.  If he didn't raise the specter, this wouldn't be an issue at all.	20
0	You failed to read my second comment.  This wasn't my intended argument at all.	20
0	Everything contained in the article is cherry picked and misrepresented, I don't have time to type out a dissertation on socioeconomics so to answer your questions: All of it.	20
0	And both South Park and "the atheists" openly mock Islam and scientology, and anything else worthy of ridicule.	20
0	I think the difference lies in the fact that Islam bans depictions of Muhammed, where as Christianity doesn't mind art being made of Jesus.	20
0	Guys, there's no justification for violence, but let me take a moment to say that the violence was somewhat justified. These muslims are like wild animals. Like a grizzly bear. They can't control themselves.	20
0	This seems like the sort of thing that probably sounded really good when it was discussed with some context around it and then somebody decided that it needed to be boiled down a quick hitter point that becomes fairly non sensical.  If the original intent was to say that withholding sex as a means of manipulation and control to get what you want is sexual violence, I can start to at least see how the dots are connected.  On its own though, that should have never made the guidelines.	20
0	Hahahahahaha....that's rich.  The reverse racism argument, classic Chab!    If there were any data herein worth refuting I would.  I'm not even going to touch your last argument, since you know, its incredibly disingenuous.  Unless you really are that obstuse.	20
0	I'm not saying that it effects free speech, nor am I saying that the victims were in the wrong. And there's a difference in blashphemy and depicting Muhammed (at least how I see it). Depections of Muhammed are banned because he was too perfect to be depicted by a human, even in a reverent way. Obviously a mocking depiction of Jesus is blasphemous, but regular depictions are just fine. Therein lies the difference.	20
0	&gt;loses  It's losses.  And again, you miss my point completely.  The polls, no matter how scientific are meaningless.  How the hell does a poll of popular opinion get to the root of the issue?  It doesn't.    And since you insist on continuing down this path, I don't think that anyone has said that looting will get to the root of the issue.  That seems to be an exclusively Conservative trope meant to further demonize the black men and women seeking to have their voices heard.	20
0	Your argument is stupid and antithetical to a liberal society.	20
0	When people face a long train of abuses, they reserve the right to resort to violence (its in the Declaration of Indepence).  Good, law-abiding, successful, educated folks will sometimes dress up in garb and throw the Tea in the Harbor, will they not?	20
0	A number of conservatives declare candidacy for president and this is what we are talking about here?	20
0	Obviously the guy didn't do anything to deserve being called racist or a bigot. These guys that open carry rifles piss me off for a different reason, though. It's just counter-productive in the worst way. The biggest obstacle to the gun rights movement is the public perception of gun-owners as crazy rednecks, and carrying around a fully loaded rifle with ammunition pouches only intensifies that perception. He's confirming their bias against gun owners because he just wants to be as in-your-face as possible. It's selfish and short-sighted. I just wish people like this guy would realize that even if something is your right, it's not always the right thing to do.	20

0	So, you think it's good that if Hillary is elected her husband will still give paid speeches?	20
0	That's microeconomics at work bro.  The blue states have all the freeloaders, the red states get Federal money from military, projects, and other stuff that the government finds useful.	20
0	I don't support any ideology that supports violence to silence others they don't agree with.  But that said, I don't see the point in deliberately antagonizing Muslims.  I mean if our freedom and very existence offends them then too damn bad, but why poke the bear?	20
0	I didn't contradict myself.  What do you mean?	20
0	If the blue states "have all the freeloaders", why do they contribute more than red states?	20
0	Never made it past grade 10 did you?	20
0	How come the quote on the blog contains "withholding sex" but the U-M page does not mention that at all?  The blog also says "always demanding sex" while the U-M page only says "demanding sex."    I'm pretty sure this blogger edited the quote and that is completely unethical.  EDIT: Nevermind, just a very old article.  They've changed the page since then.	20

0	This article was poorly written and his arguments were weak at best.  His logic that increases in CO2 are actually going to be good for plants and animals is rather amusing.  I vote conservative, but the overwhelming evidence is starting to show that denying humans are having an impact to the global climate is becoming harder and harder to refute. I am honestly sick of hearing about this and can't wait until we start addressing this and it is no longer a political issue.	20

0	Yes, science done by scientists.  Not some bullshit made up by politicians.  Politicians shouldn't have any say on this issue. Experts in scientific fields across many disciplines all have overwhelming evidence of our contributions to the shit we put in the atmosphere.  if 99 out of 100 doctors told you you have cancer would you still not believe them?  I don't get why this is a political issue.  Plus, the issue I have a hard time wrapping my head around, what is the reason to not prevent or reduce some of the things we put in the atmosphere?  Having a cleaner planet benefits all.	20

0	That's not true. I think anyone with an opinion is valuable. Also, disabled people and mentally ill people aren't babies. They're still conscious...        Also, you're putting things on a hierarchy too. When you look at the amount of people who die from committing illegal abortions and you go "it's the price to pay" you're putting the baby above the person.    so you go "babies&gt;people"    and I go "people&gt;babies"	20
0	We'll see, anyway.  If 5 of justices say so, it'll *never* be undone.	20

0	That bugs me more than anything. Gay marriage was voted down in 30 of 32 states it was voted on. It is **clearly** not in the Constitution. But, that doesn't matter for at least 4 unelected judges.       If it goes through this way, we will be living under judicial despotism.	20

0	What I'm trying to say is: he doesn't have a serious chance at getting the candidacy. He's never been in government, even as a conservative he's just a terrible choice. Our party really needs to start weening these people out now.  I repeat he has absolutely zero experience in government. Even pretending like he is a serious candidate is embarrassing.	20
0	&gt; But you can't plan on having a career that won't support you.  Ta-da.  So it is the pay after all.  Well, that's exactly what they're trying to change.  Just like factory workers before them and coal miners before them.  This is what unions do, they make careers out of low skill jobs.  Whether or not you support unions probably depends on whether or not you think you benefit from them.	20

0	I think they are asking an important question honestly. Its why are people like those two gunmen wanting to go through with acts like this?  What can push people to acting like this.  Also, I think part of it is they want to try to make sure it doesn't spill into blanket islamophobia, but is instead focused on those who are going to commit terrorist acts.	20
0	The Vast Leftwing Conspiracy is afoot....	20
0	False.  Running does not equal probable cause.  The Supreme Court disagrees with you, and I trust them over you.	20
0	Running does not create probable cause for an arrest; at best, running in a "high-crime" area creates ~~probable cause~~ reasonable suspicion for a Terry stop, NOT an arrest (different standards).  Thus, the moment Gray ran did not create probable cause for an arrest.  At best, they had reasonable suspicion for a Terry stop, which will likely be the crux of the case.	20
0	Its awesome that they are doing so well, but the "study" doesnt point anything out, the size, scope of the respective companies all vary, different environments for the business. If anything it does point out that men still hold a massive amount of CEO jobs.	20
0	Of course leftists will say that the bible has brutal passages too. The difference between the bible and the Quran is that the bible has an overarching authority that interprets these passages in context. For catholics this authority is the Catholic Church.

0	True. It seems that some sects of Muslims view doing that of their prophet to be one of the biggest no-nos. Although apparently the Quran doesn't explicitly forbid drawing. Its just some people have come to believe it.  I am not certain Christianity has anything that it takes as seriously/sacred/forbidden as no drawing of Muhammed is to some of them.	20

If I wouldn't like it if atheists or Muslims did something profane to an icon of Christ, or the blessed virgin, I feel that we oughtn't do the same to their holy figures, even if *we* don't agree that it's profane.  That is to say, to me, this drawing Muhammad thing strikes me as being pretty inconsistent with our beliefs too.	20

0	Well it is sort of awkward to have black people standing underneath a Confederate flag.	20
0	if it doesn't matter, then why are you upset?	20
0	I'm just not comfortable with minors who are black being under a flag that was born out of an organization primarily motivated by defense of slavery as an institution and economic engine in a re-enactment.   To me it's like asking Jewish kids from a Shul to be the Waffen-SS during a Normandy re-enactment.     I'm not going to pull any punches about that, and I'm not going to get into an argument about "it was states rights" here.   I can be a conservative without defending the Confederacy.	20
0	That fictional pro-life terrorism...	20
0	This is a perfect example of why voting for third parties is a bad idea. The majority of voters (52%) supported a right leaning party, with Wildrose getting 24% and the Progressive Conservatives getting 28%. The NDP won with only 40% of the vote.	20
0	He's in the middle.	20
0	Ha-Ha, I'm American, and don't care	20
0	&gt;Until then, this is just more statistical trickery in order to further an agenda.  So you assume the worst until proven without a doubt otherwise? Ok	20
0	Unfortunately, we've lost the fine art of common sense.  Teacher leading a prayer in a public school?  Common sense says inappropriate. Teacher setting aside "private medication time" for 2 minutes?  Common sense says "sure, whatever."  Kid refuses to say the pledge of allegiance?  Common sense says get on the team for the big win, jackass. Kid's father sues school over the pledge of allegiance?  Common sense says go back to Russia, communist.  If only we could apply good old fashioned common sense, we'd have much happier lives.	20
0	It doesn't fit their preconceived notions	20
0	So you assume every number/data point *ever* given by the government is false until you can personally attest to its validity?	20
0	What terrifies the libs?  The White Walker.	20
0	Teaching kids about great art and culture is one way to reduce crime. It's better than throwing all their dads in jail at least.	20
0	You said she should worry about cleaning up crime, but you're also saying we shouldn't actually do anything to reduce the crime rate. Which is it?	20
0	So, you'd say that race, gender, and sexual orientation doesn't have any societal issues?	20
0	If you'll note, I said it's a symbol of hate in New England. If someone is advocating, openly and overly proud of, and prominently displaying symbols of an ideology on their homes, vehicles, and bodies in an area where that ideology is not natural, they are most likely part of the radical wing of that ideology.	20
0	I was asking how he wanted to reduce the crime rate in that comment.  In my previous comment, I was saying that long sentences for certain kinds of crime (nonviolent drug offenses, mostly) turn small-time criminals in violent career felons, and deprive their kids of a father which creates more criminals in the next generation. Even if long prison sentences deter some drug crimes, I think the harm is greater than the benefit. It would be better to give them community service, a fine, and rehab if needed.	20
0	I'd vote for Clinton. If rather have a realpolitik democrat stymied by an opposing congers than a immigration traitor with a same-party congress	20
0	So might as well use the death penalty on anybody who gets a speeding ticket, right?	20
0	Do you think a Army that consist mostly of volunteers would turn on it's own people in mass?	20
0	Kids should not be given these surveys period but certainly not until the parent has signed off on their participation. People will argue that will skew the results but who cares? This is creepy as hell. Imagine if a stranger on the street asked your 12 year old daughter if she's ever had anal sex with up to 6 guys. I know a lot of men who would send someone to the e.r. if they did that.	20
0	Congratulations, but unfortunately we don't allow posts that stir up cross sub drama or posts that point out how liberal /r/politics are. It's nothing personal, it's just that we would be flooded with these comments if they were allowed.   Congrats again for the gold.	20
0	Many states dont require voter Id.Like CA for example who have the most illegals.	20
0	Oooooh, look at the brave dissidents downvoting you for daring the sheep to think for themselves.	20
0	Man....muttering "under God" makes you feel weird?  This fucking country these days...	20
0	"My religion is better than your religion!"	20
0	Because an elementary school child has no real concept of abstract thought.  So unless your parents were atheists and taught you not to believe in God, it's bizarre that you'd have a strong opinion about it as a child.  We inherit most of our childhood beliefs from our parents.  Yeah, the pledge added "under God" in order to stick it to the godless communists...I get it and the reason it wasn't previously in the pledge is likely the same reason the 14th amendment didn't explicitly deny same sex marriage:  the people who originally wrote it couldn't imagine a world in which such specificity would ever be needed.	20
0	It's sad that people's lives are considered a "political agenda".	20
0	I appreciate this desire to contribute your political opinion to this discussion, but please do so whenever you are of voting age and mature enough.	20
0	that argument has a lot of validity.  In the end Obama, FDR, and Lincoln have irreversibly damaged our once great nation and system of self governance	20
0	Well we know that representation is important for children's emotional growth, and has measurably positive effects on adults. I would argue that unless there's a definable problem with having more diverse and targeted mascots that there isn't anything to complain about.	20
0	See everyone Brodo00095 believes in AGW so that means he cares.  Of course, he still heats his house, drives his car, and eats his industrialize food just like you.  But because he believes his actions are destroying the planet, and you don't, he is better than you... or something.	20
0	I do remember it; never believed it, and boy what that an easy call.	20
0	The North, while the Confederacy existed in the south, was a magical wonderland for free blacks.... Right?	20
0	The latter.  Now please don't exhaust me with apocryphal tales of the Founding Fathers all being atheists.	20
0	Yes, and despite my libertarian streak I have no problems with loyalty oaths.  If you're going to be a citizen or reside in the United States, you owe it your loyalty or you can renounce your association with the republic and leave.	20
0	I mean, it was terrible what happened but what were they expecting? They were essentially poking the eye of the bear and getting shocked when it attacked. It was a very childish and stupid thing to do that lead to disastrous results.	20
0	While I respect that he has the freedom to do what he did, I do have a right to consider him an asshole for doing so. Labeling him as a hater should be reasonable, considering the alternative is what those equally asshole-ish radicals would do.	20
0	I'd ask how one of the mascot costumes having brown skin or being female would be considered a controversial social statement, but I'm sure the answer would have something to do with them hurting your feelings.	20
0	Is it not reasonable to assume that he hates Islam enough that he'd go out of his way to do something offensive? You'd think that somebody who doesn't actually hate the religion wouldn't bother wasting time participating in that event.	20
0	SPLC also has the Nation of Islam and other black separatist groups on its extremists lists. AFDI is very specifically, anti-Muslim and treats Islam as a monolithic religion when it's not. They're perfectly within their rights to put out their bilge, but just because SPLC names them as a hate-group doesn't mean that SPLC is crooked.	20
0	Still, to go out of your way to spend your day at an anti-Islam event, that's the very definition of hating something.	20
0	Gee, I wonder how Iran got into the position where it can develop nukes? Never mind, found out it was the same guy who allowed that now says we need a missile shield. Barn door open, something horse escaped, something close barn door now.	20
0	But your whole argument is void considering God didn't actually command to kill anybody who draws pictures or creates idols. This is not an Islamic belief.   Edit: And besides, Muslims and Christians follow the same God. The whole "different deity" deal is non-existent with Abrahamic religions.	20
0	I'm by no means a fan of radical Islamist but I kind of agree with them putting him on the hate group list. He did something intentionally provocative that can easily be seen as hateful. It's his right to do so, but in addition to offending radical Muslims, it also greatly offends the moderate Muslims. This was also not someone doodling Muhammad, it was an organized attempt to provoke another religion and only that. I can see why they did it and can kind of agree with it	20
0	I agree with the mouse trap idea. Let's throw a Fuck You ISIS parade in every city in Texas. Let's make Muhammad cartoon billboards and t-shirts. Let's draw these assholes into a fight where they are outgunned 100-1.	20
0	This is true to an extent. think about people who are immigrents, they wont know about the topics that are being presented, or the context. and example is one problem that ive given is about football, this kid thought I ment soccer and got the assignment wrong. I let him redo it of course but that type of thing happens, and often times in more subtle ways then you might expect.  I had to explain things in more detail to him. However. this kid worked harder then just about anyone else and thats the difference between him and a lot of kids that they are saying "are disadvantaged".	20
0	No it's not. People on the left who support same-sex marriage despite religious arguments from Christians will continue to do so, despite religious arguments from Muslims, too. They're usually the same kinds of arguments, anyway.  Limbaugh builds so many straw-man arguments against the left that I'm not at all surprised his ratings have been circling the drain for a while. When he does this, he undermines any legitimate criticisms he might have against the left.	20
0	Hey. Just think of all the classes that are mostly republican that you just don't know.	20
0	Not a fair comparison. Islam is a group of people who have "laws" against drawing Muhammad. As far as I know, there's no group of rapists with a code of laws.	20
0	I said they have the right to do it	20
0	At least a straw man would reach a point unlike you.	20
0	It seems fitting that an opposite of humility is arrogance, which is apparent even here.   They were wise people.	20
0	Yea we should completely ignore that Dick Cheany propped up Irans nuclear program 20x higher while he was Vice President.    http://youtu.be/5i6w3ZaJFPU	20
0	I don't follow if *Trigger's Broom Paradox* is what you are referencing.	20
0	It's not entirely clear what the constitution has to say about hate speech.    There is still a doctrinal strand that allows legislatures to ban things that look a lot like hate speech under a "group libel" theory.  Beauharnais v. Illinois is old, and subsequent history hasn't entirely settled it, but it's not as if anything is so clear that either side can point and laugh at the other here.	20
0	But I see endless pot posts from former classmates and many of them are gay.	20
0	So you believe those two men just randomly showed up in Garland TX that day at the same exact time of the very overtly racist and definitively anti-Muslim prophet Mohammad cartoon drawing contest??      Domestic terrorism delivered right to our front doorstep, courtesy Pamela Geller and Co with their little racist cartoon drawing contest.  No thank you.  I will not carry their water for them the way you do.  That path just leads to more violence and less freedom for all.	20
0	Difference in those is most people in the army lean toward the conservative spectrum. That combined with a much easier ability to access information would make that more unlikely.	20
0	Oh, of course!  Obviously those who want to "help" everyone must have more and better things since they suffer so much and work so hard for us.	20
0	They would be brought down by their fellow soilders fairly quickly.	20
0	If that's the case, support your claim with scientific studies and not irrelevant anecdotes.	20
0	Good thing we have an ally in the area with a well-developed, highly-successful missile defense system on whom we could lean for strategic support in implementing a similar system.  I'm glad the Commander and Chief hasn't done anything to alienate that ally and its duly elected head of state.  /s	20
0	I have an amazing feeling that Rutgers alumni will be overwhelmed by a strong sensation of not giving a shit.  Most people don't care about the politics you hold so dear.	20
0	They're right. Teachers should be funding our retirement now.	20
0	Your definition of politics is extremely biased. For fucks sake, we kick off every football game with the National Anthem, and I don't see you complaining.  That's pretty hypocritical, don't you think?	20
0	I do agree, but I am just saying it isn't right to say that this is a freedom of speech issue.  Its not anything the 1st amendment is supposed to do anything about.  It definitely violates other laws. I completely agree with that.	20
0	I wish posts like these would make it to the front page so everyone could see them.	20
0	&gt; the reason why good conservative ideas are not taken seriously  Do you have an example of a good conservative idea that isn't taken seriously because of my kind of talk?	20
0	You're still the one making the accusation.	20
0	Islam needs to get its act together.	20
0	&gt;According to Swift, from a purely instrumental position the answer is straightforward. ‘One way philosophers might think about solving the social justice problem would be by simply abolishing the family. If the family is this source of unfairness in society then it looks plausible to think that if we abolished the family there would be a more level playing field.’     **THIS** is from the actual source article. This is his actual solution to inequality. Abolish families because healthy families create unfair advantages. Seriously, screw this guy and his 'social justice' sympathizers.	20
0	Ben is quite a bit younger than I am, but when I was a teenager, a joke went around:  Q: How can you tell when Bill and Hillary are lying?  A: Their lips are moving.	20
0	I dont know why I have a very hard time listening to this guy. His manner of speaking is distracting. There's something about his speech that seems broken and forced.	20
0	Now I know my fellow conservatives here have their minds made up unfortunately, but the Muslim community laughs at this idiot.	20
0	"Thoughtcriminal" is the new "t" word.	20
0	&gt;The biggest thing in this argument that stops it dead every time is the residual fact that if you are a Muslim you may not and will not ever critique Islam. So until they can look at what they believe in and change it then no, they will never be compatible.  I'd like to hear your assessment on Christianity's biggest flaws, whenever you have a chance.	20
0	Los Angeles is actually like 5 major cities plus suburbs in one massive sprawling area.   Rioting was centred mostly in south central LA.	20
0	Serious question: why do we have a much simpler spoken and written language today then compared to english when it was spoken during the revolution? Franklins writings and other works had much fancier writing. Writing and speaking today seems almost boring compared to older works.	20
0	That wouldn't be productive though. It's specifically starting a culture war for the sake of it. Even the most ardent free speech advocates (I'm guessing) will concede that a photo of full frontal nudity should not be shown mid afternoon in times square.	20
0	Um, what?!?	20
0	Trolling is a art.	20
0	Who do you think is better than Hillary? Another warmongering Bush maybe? At least Hillary won't allow loosened regulations and sink our economy like Bush and Cheney did.   Edit: Changed Jeb Bush to just Bush	20
0	The Creator does not mean the Christian concept of god, whatever that is.	20
0	But it does mean 'not atheism'.	20
0	Yes, but it can also mean "the gods" mentioned by Marcus Aurelius.	20
0	Must cultural studies ignore religion?  From the article it doesn't sound like the group is performing a church service, they're just speaking about the role of Christianity in the founding of our country.  It's history, but since the topic includes religion they are banned.  Please read the link before making a fool of yourself next time.	20
0	So we can have a TV show - ON EASTER FUCKING SUNDAY - depict Jesus Christ being murdered by a jewish kid, quite graphic and disturbingly btw, but this dumbass contest is "hate speech" thats not protected by the consitution. Fuck liberal ideologies, bunch of backward, islamic sympathizing, anti-christian hate mongers.	20
0	What's the "good" conservative idea about immigration that you're referring to?  [Edit: Crickets.  I knew he was full of shit.]	20
0	And that type of language is why we're a rudderless nation.	20
0	/&gt; Christianity  /&gt; flaws  pick one /s  In all reality I do think that the problem in islam comes from the fact that it's a theological deviant of truth (in my opinion, Catholicism), in a way that judaism isnt	20
0	&gt; expand Medicare  Medicaid*	20
0	&gt; Liberalism is a mental disorder   That's not fair. There are plenty of liberals that don't agree with what this guy's saying. He doesn't represent all of us. Neither do other high-profile idiots, just like Jeb Bush and Bill O'Reilly don't represent all conservatives. Don't be hateful of others just because they have different ideas or values than you.	20
0	Should I have said it in French?	20
0	And every "philosopher" or "intellectual" is "just talking, man..."	20
0	&gt; Honestly they just shouldn't provide buildings or services like these if they risk pushing beliefs.  Yeah, like the man made global warming myth.	20
0	Yep. If the government may not constitutionally take a stance on religion, it should not be allowed to take a stance on anything, lest it be used for propaganda.	20
0	&gt;Don't be hateful of others just because they have different ideas or values than you.   I guess that makes you a hypocrite because that's how all liberals are! It's your way and no one else's way. Get out of our sub.	20
0	Except I haven't been hateful towards anybody. I called him a jackass because he made a vast generalization, but I feel calling someone a jackass for saying I have a mental disorder for my political beliefs is pretty measured and deserved.  &gt; It's your way and no one else's way.  Try actually reading what I say, man. Read my other reply, too. That's not at all how it is. That is *precisely* the way you're being, and you're projecting it on somebody who takes actual steps to understand people who have different beliefs.  &gt;Get out of our sub.  No.	20
0	I don't understand why you people lurk here. Go piss someone else off.	20
0	The gov decides.  The first amendment protects the govs rights, just like the second is about the national guard and the police.	20
0	Would you really die for it?	20

0	Did you even read my post? The Treaty of Paris **explicitly mentions the trinity, a uniquely Christian concept**.	20
0	I think that's a primal human issue.	20
0	I myself was given a grade on a term paper in high school that ruined my chance of an A because my teacher deemed me to conservative to be important in society, just like the author is afraid of.	20
0	The militias were the way the slaver states prevented insurrection. They were a state-level instrument of terror directed at the black population. The slaver states wouldn't have joined the Union at all, had slavery been outlawed.	20
0	"Taxpayers who saw smaller refunds – or owed the state money this April – said in interviews the surplus isn’t worth celebrating."  This'd is actually a good thing. Why give the government an interest-free loan of your money. Better to get one. I don't care about the check I write in April; I care about the entire bill.  Want a real shock? Get rid of withholding entirely and then we'll see tax revolt.   (Oh, who am I kiding? No, we wouldn't.)	20
0	"And though they have only combed through a small portion of the data"  Ohh there it is! Obviously the discussion is over since they haven't even analyzed a significant amount of data yet.... and the data is only in their city. Please.	20
0	Wrong. You are making the accusation that police brutality is on the rise, when unbiased assessments say you're wrong.	20
0	&gt; No-Knock Arrest Warrants are on the rise.   Again. Something that can't be supported by any legitimate evidence.	20
0	The sources for all the statistics are openly available. Challenge them if you can.	20
0	I'm sorry... you're under the assumption that OVER 99% of police interaction isn't with some someone committing a crime... that's you're position?	20
0	Sometimes a hammer is more effective than a scalpel.	20

0	Conservatives in the UK can be compared to Dems in the US. lol. I don't know what there is to cheer for. UKIP is probably the only party that can be compared to the GOP.	20
0	I completely disagree with what this sub is and should be about.  Wait until election season when this board is 75% liberals "respectfully" offering their dialogue.  The mission statement itself is pretty clear: "We are for Conservatives (fiscal and social) to discuss political and cultural issues."	20
0	Well clearly the towers were full of racist cops and Christian bakers who refused to do gay wedding cakes.	20
0	Well let's say it's election season and that each and everyone liberal actually is respectful.  Even so, the mere fact that they show up in droves and turn /r/conservative in to /r/respectfullydebateaconservative is in itself disrespectful.  I come to this board to discuss conservative principles and politics with fellow conservatives. I don't come here to enlighten liberals or debate them.	20
0	Don't forget that any decreases in unemployment over the last year or so are either people who stopped looking or bad part-time jobs created out of necessity due to Obamacare.	20
0	All of my conversations are meaningful to me.	20
0	Why should we be worried about people who have stopped looking for work and are living with their parents, watching daytime tv?  The goal of capitalism is to find jobs for people who want them.  If you've given up, we shouldn't be worrying about finding you a job.  If you don't care, the BLS shouldn't care either.  At that point, you're not unemployed, you just don't work.	20
0	This is the ultimate goal of the whole #nojusticenopeace	20
0	The primary doesn't determine who picks the Supreme Court justices.	20
0	It is an indicator of economic growth.  No economy can be expected to give jobs to people who aren't trying to get jobs.	20
0	I wouldn't say European right wingers are center right at least not in the American sense, essentially they're the to the right of fascism which is right of communism	20
0	Come on. Trickle down economics is a scam; no more tax cuts should be given to the rich. Lets cut the "free" trade agreements, force corporations to bring back jobs that pay a liveable wage to people, and stop trying to blame citizens who are born into the cycle of poverty. The profit-incentive has ruined the middle class. Let's not elect someone who will continue the scam.	20
0	It's about validation, if 2 guys can act like a family with children married after forcing a pastor to do their ceremony then they'll feel like they're just like everyone else but they're not	20

0	&gt;Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the DoI, **does not seem to be Christian** in religious belief  &gt;He endorsed the moral virtue of Jesus' teaching, and by that measure **recognized himself as Christian**  Way to contradict yourself	20
0	Suffice to say, they have never cared about what's good for the children at all, so it's not really a surprise.	20
0	Do you really want the federal government running the elections?	20
0	The very concept of "left" vs "right" is flawed- politics don't fit neatly into exactly two opposing branches.	20
0	They have 30% of the seats in parliament. But I could be wrong on the vote percentage. I know the conservatives got 30% of the vote but have 51% of the seats in parliament.	20
0	First off, you're making a false equivalency argument. Just because liberals aren't welcome to come and challenge Conservatism in this forum (it says this in the sidebar which you haven't read) doesn't mean that this sub is an "echo chamber."  The point is that this forum should be a place for Conservatives to discuss political and cultural issues (again in the sidebar). We aren't sheep that circlejerk the entire time. There can be debate among conservatives about any number of things. We have neo-cons and libertarian conservatives in this forum, for example.	20
0	I personally would rather have a kid raised by a loving mother and a father than being shuffled around to potentially abusive foster homes or a home that lacks either a mother or a father.	20
0	I like how activists are calling racism when blacks and hispanics get a whole month of appreciation.What do whites get? flak every single day of the month.	20
0	This should really help heal wounds and bridge divides.  After all my people have been through the least we deserve is barbecue reparations!	20
0	Because they are basically hard-right. And there's no town in the UK where hard-right is the most popular opinion.	20
0	Good gay parents &gt; bad straight parents. Pound for pound though, good straight parents &gt; good gay parents.	20
0	Nope...the winner of the general election does.  You might want to look into it.	20
0	actually, 100% of presidential elections the past 60+ years have been decided by black voters. They vote 98% democratic. If they just slightly distributed their votes across party lines (you know, like every other race in America does) then Democrats would have won ZERO elections. Unfortunately, even decades upon decades of the same socio-economic situations isn't enough for black people in Democratic cities to catch on to the fact that Dems have ZERO incentive to better their situation. Somehow it's still the fault of republicans. Not sure how...	20
0	It's just that it's increasing in intensity and they're doubling down on it. I suppose it's more apparent now that we have troubles around the world (and within the US). Americans should be uniting behind this flag and loving this country, not trying to tear it apart from inside.   I'm curious, is this a cynical deliberate move on the left or just a product of their naive incompetence and silly idealism?	20

0	Got a source on that, it isn't in the article...	20
0	That's the thing. They THOUGHT no one would use the program and it would be a 5 - 10 cent tax on nearly all cans sold in the state. To me it's sweet justice that it's being exploited so it costs them more, sneaky Cali.	20
0	I adhere to all church doctrine, as does my brother.	20
0	Because just even mildly bad weather in one particular heavily blue or red region will keep millions of those voters home and determine the election.	20
0	I feel exactly the same way. I want that feeling again, and I want it for my kids &amp; grandkids.  Who do you like in 2016?  I REALLY like Cruz ... The fact that he is attacked by the left tells me they are afraid of him. He is smart as a whip, and very good at articulating conservatism. Can't wait to see him debate.	20
0	Power that wasn't intended in the development of the Electoral College. Congress also has tremendous power in limiting what the President does, but they choose not to.	20

0	So you agree with the trauma these kids and family are going through?	20
0	Biologically they are ideally defined by the two people who conceived them.	20
0	So Issa says the poor in our country are the envy of the world because they eat the best, have clean water, and electricity so you call him wrong  because of income inequality, unemployment and health insurance.      What an idiotic response -- one I would expect from an 'independent.' Income inequality does not change the standard of living for the poor in different countries, so your first one is gone. The unemployed in America still eat, have clean water and electricity, so that doesn't matter either. And our poor have free Medicare, so... yeah. Our poor are the envy of even the middle class for the vast majority of the world.	20
0	Oh, gosh. I don't know enough about this incident to say if the police were in the right, but the father seems like a nutjob. Not taking your kids to the doctor is extremely idiotic, though completely legal, but the way he talks about the public school system makes me question him. As a Christian currently enrolled at a public high school, it does not damage me nor my beliefs. It seems like he is setting his children up to fail by sheltering them.	20
0	Yeahhhh...so what are gays going to say when they claim they want to raise orphan's, but only if it's a baby? Doesn't seem very generous when the older kids are the ones in the most need.	20
0	That's true, but the perfect setting for a foster child is a mom and dad who are loving and caring. It should be the goal.	20

0	We have no idea what, if any trauma the kids are going through now, or may have been going through just prior to their removal.  For all we know the parents are abusers/neglecters/molesters/etc.    Privacy laws are evil, and give cover to government abusers and medical abusers, more than they protect anyone that they claim to be protecting.  Because of the privacy laws, the public will never know the real story here, and that's dangerous, because if there *is* a government abuse of power in this case, the public can't take any effective action to curb it.	20
0	I just dug up one part of the story we were missing:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/35bg1c/report_police_seize_10_children_from_family/cr39963  All I can say is **WTF??**	20

0	Welfare is not a way out but an optional lifestyle. Republicans do not offer enough money to make it such. Perscribe to that philosophy and republicans are monsters for destroying a lifestyle choice.	20

0	I think they'd find a way to blame anyone named 'Bush' and Pam Geller.	20

0	yes it is a lifestyle choice, but when Democrats actively ruin your schools through bureaucratic measures, disincentivize having a nuclear family, and preach tolerance towards detrimental lifestyle choices your "choice" to participate in a welfare lifestyle is pretty much predetermined for you.   Eventually these voters will wake up and realize that the Democrats they've elected the past 50 years have absolutely no intention of actually helping them at all. So far 50 years of the same crap hasn't been enough time for some of these exclusively democratic states in the North to figure this out. Maybe it'll take another 50. Who knows...	20
0	Homosexuals should remain chaste, as should all unmarried people.   As far as republican or democrat: who cares. I only care about their moral character and their souls.	20
0	This is my concern, Being a catholic. This is why homosexual adoption is never possible in my books.	20
0	I cringe when politicians resort to rhetoric and even more when they receive positive feedback for saying it.	20
0	All people are assholes.	20
0	They would try and say that the jihadists were "brainwashed" by Fox News into thinking gays should be targeted. You know it's always the conservatives fault.	20
0	THEY THEY THEY Who are you even talking to? When was the last time you saw a tongue get cut off? Cool it bro, we can all get along	20
0	Not the same country.	20
0	I know right. Calling a human being "illegal" as if that's their defining feature is incredibly dehumanizing. It's an amazingly inappropriate term.	20
0	Which is why we'll be less than 50% of the population by 2040-ish.	20
0	They wont. The gays are too useful to thier cause. Just wait until they win the heart and souls of the American public. Then the purge will begin and the Islamists will rid the world of the curse of gayness.	20
0	No. I expect gay to be representative of the norm if that is what they now want to participate in. That means that an equivalent % of their community which wishes to "help" should be attempting to help older children. If they aren't, then they're just trying to live out some solipsistic fantasy that they're the same as a hetero couple.	20
0	A facebook page that had democrat ideology so simple it was in meme form, such as earns .77 cents works twice as hard or some bullshit	20
0	I think he's often misquoted on that, he has a pretty good point it's just not delivered well. I think now he's running he will watch his tongue.   I'm not giving up on him. Not yet, I'll definitely vote him primaries.	20
0	Sure, I'll piss off. But I hope you'll reexamine your dismissive view towards not only the word but the potentially the concept of dehumanizing. After all, today's the 70th anniversary of the end of WWII in Europe. And that was the perhaps the best example of dehumanization leading to ethnic cleansing and genocide.	20
0	Centrist in the sense that he's halfway between Josef Stalin and Franklin Roosevelt, maybe.  Roosevelt had some pretty fucked-up ideas, but at least he cared about the rule of law and the constitution.	20
0	Or, you know, stop burning upwards of a billion tax payer dollars a year chasing after marijuana. That would be a time and money saver in front of everything else.	20
0	That's not what I said. I said dehumanization leads to genocide. I've said nothing about immigration law whatsoever.	20
0	If you must resort to calling me stupid instead of trying to understand my point of view and having a rational debate, then it's that's a problem on your end, not mine.	20
0	But why does Muhammad have the thin skin?	20
0	Because every Congressman always gets everything he wants.	20
0	Aah there we go. I kip had 13% of the vote... Ok those numbers make much more sense.	20
0	A child dying in Somalia doesn't affect my life either. This "doesn't affect your life" thing is a non-starter.   My religion is every bit as valid in informing public policy and my part/power within it as your irreligion (or whatever it is) does.   You seem to think that your motives are purer and more valid than mine simply because of their origin? Nonsense.   A homosexual couple is as detestable to me morally as a co-habitating unmarried couple, or a polyamorous couple.   There are enough capable married heterosexual couples that want to adopt children, and this should be the only option.	20
0	Radical Islamic terrorists are sometimes caricatured as mindless zealots but they really are quite strategic. Look at the"Pallywood" effect where Palistinians use western media to slant reporting of what is happening in Israel. The Ayatollah of Iran has been tweeting recently about how terribly America treats its black citizens, despite the fact that Baltimore-style riots would have been punished mercilessly in Tehran. They might point to gay marriage as a sign of America's decadence but they are not going to shoot the enemy of their enemy.	20
0	I guess if you're looking from somewhere left of Mao, sure, but otherwise.....	20
0	That's a really poor analogy. This wasn't "walking on a street in a bikini." This was going into Crip territory wearing a red bandana. It's telling a Hell's Angel his girl looks like Steve Buscemi. The attackers  were scum who got what was coming to them, but that doesn't mean the folks that put the event together aren't jackasses.	20
0	Really depends on how much the congress at the time would care. Also he is in charge of more areas than just Baltimore. I'm sure some stuff has been done, but to do anything in Congress is nearly impossible.	20
0	&gt;In all likelihood, he actually got plenty of what he wanted, which is why Baltimore is where it is now.  Not following care to elaborate on your reasoning?	20
0	boo hoo. so you have SURRENDERED parts of L A to the gangs, without expecting HUMAN DECENCY to be present... AND,  in your analogy (which is a poor one) the free speech contest in TX didnt GO TO THEIR TERRITORY, they came to IT. they drove +1000 miles in order to exercise their hate. Have you even SEEN the comic that won? it was NOT at all, in ANY context, even REMOTELY, in the same REGION, as being POSSIBLY considered inciting or hateful.	20
0	a) I know being black and poor isnt mutually exclusive... I fail to see your point... because my point was that living in an poor neighborhood makes crime whether black or white.....        b) um.... Trayvon wasn't burglarizing the neighborhood and if he was alive he'd probably be going to some college... Also last I checked the punishment for robbery isn't death...	20
0	The left has moved to the edge and declared it the center.	20
0	If you ask /r/politics, they'll tell you that Obama is actually a right winger and Bernie Sanders is moderate.	20
0	Mostly liberal here. I can understand why some people would see this as racist, but me personally as long as it isn't some sort of long term practice it's fine with me. What I can't see however is how someone thinks it's laughable to call a bomb threat on a business. I'm just here to say that I don't know whoever that guy tweeting is, but that he is not the majority. Even those that see the business as being racist would not agree with these actions.	20
0	Democrats are the real racists. Read this article about a loyal Democrat's view on the cop rot in bad Baltimore and try an argue otherwise.	20
0	His mentor Frank Marshall Davis was a full up Stalinist, so Obama is probably closer to Stalin than Roosevelt.	20
0	No one gives a shit about minor marijuana infractions.	20
0	Really? You are going to argue with me on mutually exclusive? Mutually exclusive means if one event happens the other can't occur. While its true that the opposite of mutually exclusive is if one event happens the other event HAS to happen (if p then q), these two are not the only two ways to describe the world. See conditional independence.	20
0	That logic is a little off. I can think of plenty of cities around me that have barely gotten anything from long serving congressmen.   Anyway local government has much more to do with shaping a cities' attitudes.   Also saying he played a role is like saying Ronald Regan played a role in creating the Watts Riots since he was governor. Which that was completely caused by other circumstances.	20
0	And that gives officers the right to arrest him on a illegal blade that he had in his possession which turned out to be completely legal? I agree that Grey was not a model citizen, but his death raises a lot of uncomfortable questions around the circumstances.	20
0	Trayvon wasn't carrying any jewelry in his backpack at the time either so I'm not the only one guilty of misremembering...http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/18/justice/florida-teen-shooting-details/	20
0	If crime rate is shown to significantly vary on poverty levels then it precludes an association with race. If a black neighborhood is rich then it's not going to be associated with high crime.	20
0	While I agree the use of statistics here is quite flawed, do you really think there is no significant racism on the part of law enforcement in this country?	20
0	Yeah it's only the second most populated city. Also I where you are trying to go with this, but local government isn't that tightly connected to federal. For example where I am we have a Republican congress man, but a Democrat local government.	20
0	Too many RINOs in congress, they're not going to be able to block anything.	20
0	I was just curious what your opinion on the matter was. Clearly the use of numbers here is quite flawed, but I've seen other studies comparing the rate of drug use to drug possession charges that seem to infer racist policing, although I remain somewhat skeptical as well.  &gt;Police should not behave in any way that is racist, and there's no excuse for doing so. You shouldn't assume I'm disputing that just because I'm pointing out that Obama is a lying asshole.  Not at all what I said.	20
0	If you consider yourself white you should probably get used to the idea that you are the designated chump right now and learn how to be like Budda-level coolness. It wasn't my idea and I don't know why but that's just kinda how it's going. It does upset me a little sometimes when I see things like this but this highway has some potholes. Deal.	20
0	This guy cut his penis off at 42 because his grandmother dressed him as a girl between the age of 4 and 6.5? I find that extremely hard to comprehend. Also, wearing a dress is like taking drugs??? I think Baltimore would look like a gay pride parade if that were even slightly true.	20
0	[They're extremely biased](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/science/08tier.html?_r=0), that's just a fact.  You were completely ignorant of that?  Whooooo boy.	20
0	Well to play devils advocate,that was a trillion in stimulus so they only got 0.2% of the stimulus.	20
0	All doctors are trained in some level of psychiatry.  They have to be to differentiate between someone with a legitimate complaint and someone with mental issues.  " Some might be surprised to learn that there are many more similarities between a psychiatrist and a neurologist than between a psychiatrist and psychologist."  "The third year of medical school usually consists of intensive clinical rotations that include hands-on experience in the fields of internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery, obstetrics &amp; gynecology, psychiatry, and neurology."

0	They should put on a "white people who didn't bomb threat us appreciation day"	20
0	Nope, not directly.       Christians do not believe that a woman who gets an abortion should be tried and judged for her sin. Same with gay marriage.       Not even the extreme, fringe whacko Westboro Baptist Church has any punishment for gays. Just mean words.	20
0	You could say the same thing about religious conservatives who'd force religion dictated rules upon the non-religious. Both sides have a very "my way or the highway" attitude.	20

0	Oh, so now you *admit* that social scientists are biased.  Big of ya.   Then you, having been ignorant of this until now, presume to turn around and ask a sophomoric and condescending question?  lol.  If you want to make a particular claim, just make it.  It's Sunday, I could use a good chuckle.	20
0	I explained it in my first comment	20
0	I did, but let me elucidate because you are too partisan to accept what I say at face value. the doctrines of the Roman Catholic and Baptist are incompatible with each other. Notre Dame or Boston College wouldn't invite Jerry Falwell to its commencement exercises because he was outside of the communion, and the opposite is (or at least should be) true for Liberty University and Jeb Bush in the opposite.	20
0	I'd agree that *some people* on both sides are confused about the fact that it only restricts government, but I think it's too hasty of a generalization to say "both sides are incredibly confused" about that particular aspect of it.  However, that's only a small part of the overall picture, and it's beside the point when you have complete dumbasses like Chris Cuomo spewing absurdities about the overall scope of protected speech.	20
0	One confusion is that Nazism is "far-right" that is completely false. All you have to do is read the name. "National German Socialist Worker's Party" They banned guns, free speech, and had heavy regulations. Modern Democrats are as close to Nazis and they are to Communists, which, the combined deaths of these two ideologies killed well over 70 million people in the 20th century.	20
0	&gt; Why argue hypotheticals when you can do it?  If you want to, go right ahead - let's see the results. Tell me how offbase my view is.  Because it's not like I'm saying this blind. Take one look at mainstream liberal reactions to rioting and looting in Baltimore. They bent over backwards trying to justify it, to the point where calling the rioters 'thugs' is racist.  Now, admittedly the conservative riots that broke out after the cops were charged was... oh. Oh wait!  *There weren't any.*	20
0	All lives matter but when all your life amounts to is stealing and smoking dope then it sure matters a hell of a lot less.	20
0	They would tell you that theyw ere with you right up until that last sentence...  but not all Liberals are idiots.	20
0	The evidence for gw is based on land temperatures instead of satellite data, the gw crowd has equated carbon dioxide with pollution such as nitrogen oxide mercury carbon monoxide and smog in general when they're not. Blaming co2 is an attempt to slowly introduce more taxation and eventual population control, if you can tax co2 why not tax people for simply breathing	20
0	&gt; Brainwashed people exist within every vantage point.  That's true, but it's apples vs. oranges.  In the case of "liberalism", this attitude isn't just prevalent, it's *characteristic*, one could even say a *defining* characteristic since the philosophy itself is about surrendering to the collective.	20
0	There is a simple rule, and easy to remember. When I, a thoughtful and unblessed Buddhist, examine the Koran, I know that beyond any question every Mohammedan is insane; not in all things, but in religious matters.	20
0	Those people aren't true muslims then. Only culturally muslim. They don't know any better.	20
0	Favorite meme of all time!  LOL.	20
0	The one thing I've noticed from your posts is that you're pretty uneducated and are clueless and ignorant about a lot of things. It's sad.	20
0	Holy shit who says that? Did you seriously look through my post history and then make a public judgment call? You must be the most popular guy around where you live	20
0	Why are you being downvoted? Jesus, the LGBT infects this sub and downvotes anything against their opinions. IMHO homosexuality is a choice, until science proves otherwise, it will continue to be a choice in my eyes.	20
0	Doesn't make you any less of a moron. I saw another post of yours originally before stumbling upon this one. And man you need to do some research. You are on the internet after all.	20
0	With the notible difference that the thought is actually going throuh the girls head, while the fetus nerval system is not yet developed enough to grasp a thought, or even react to stimuli.	20
0	The thing about science is that it isn't as black and white as it may seem. All results are up for interpretation. If the same types of people are interpreting the results, it can really cause a bias in the findings.	20
0	But , but the TV and the news?	20
0	The old damned if we do, damned if we dont problematic. Gadaffi held the different clans and interests in his country together and was a garant for stability. But he did so by terrorizing the Lybian people. I dont know the answer, but i think Rand Paul is pretty fast in his judgement: Not intervening is always the right option, intervening always the wrong one. In my opinion thats having a ideologically skewed view, but i could be wrong. Nevertheless, gadhaffi was old, and the land probably would be the same shithole if he had died a normal death. So the only thing clinton did was speed up the process.	20
0	This meme is kryptonite for the Democrats.	20
0	I'd encourage you to read up more on the subject.  Under nazi rule, gun laws were actually relaxed for all people except Jews, who were no longer a protected class in Germany under nazi rule.  Free speech has been banned by both far left and far right dictators...and has been a huge value the moderates of both parties.  Hitler LOATHED Communism and Marxism.  The nazi party was socialist in name only.	20
0	Is it just more or is this article and the one posted by /u/TeaPartyOverlord in the comments section both highly sensationalized by two sides wanting to prove a point. Not wanting to actually look at facts. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.   Edit: Interesting this comment was in the positive until i mentioned being left a bit further down in the comments.	20
0	&gt;For example just because most police officers are good doesn't mean we should ignore the bad ones.   I am not aware of anybody that thinks we should.	20
0	What else would you expect from a field of study populated with nothing but pseudo-intellectuals who spent 7 years in college learning mostly how to say 'circle jerk' but making it take up at least a paragraph of big words?	20
0	I think we should be skeptical of psychology in general.   Why does everything have to have a diagnosis? Why over-think the human mind?   We could spend years diagnosing and treating a patient with 'Borderline Personality Disorder', or we could just do the easy, logical thing and just say that person is an 'asshole'.	20
0	This is so misdirected and over generalized, there isn't a productive way to respond.	20
0	This is a good one.	20
0	Frankly there isn't one concrete truth. It's more of a spectrum. We have a middle ground that is closest to the truth. The middle ground can lean left or right and be still accurate. Then we move to the extreme sides that don't show an accurate picture of anything.	20
0	I responded to /u/Kuntri because I believe that to be a genuine lack of understanding, and not blatant malice.   You, however, are being extremely offensive.   "It" is dehumanizing. It's easy to not give a shit about someone you don't consider human. The ease in which you do so is also disturbing.   I believe /u/Kuntri to be underinfomed. You are a bully.	20

0	"This series of self-serving and inaccurate statements would create chaos in the weeks following...."  The history of Obama bin Biden regime served up on one sentence.	20
0	This is a no-true-scotsman fallacy.   I have Muslim friends who keep Halal and pray daily, some of whom wear hijab. They are Muslim. Incidentally, they don't hate America, have never killed anyone, and are perfectly comfortable discussing religion. Just like any other religion, there's a huge variation in how strictly people choose to interpret scripture.	20

0	That is a cop out.	20
0	I don't agree with your conclusion but your assessment of the flaws seems spot on for everyone.	20
0	Great article, and yes it's true that lots of people tragically commit suicide because they've been deluded by cultural marxists into believing that hacking their genitals away is the key to their problem. It's a shame that their lives are used as pawns in the left-wing's game to destroy any and all values that are even remotely religious based or have an ounce of decency.	20

0	Intellectual discoveries in the Muslim world happened despite Islam, not because of it.	20
0	Ok? I don't really understand what your comment ads to the discussion, because it doesn't seem to encourage any engaged thinking.  And we all know if it adds nothing, it is a true shitpost and should never have been posted in the first place. If you meant "Fetus' are not parasites", they fulfill the definition of a parasite, so as much as it might hurt your feelings, it literally is a [parasite.](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/parasite)	20
0	I never understood why Dems think raising the minimum wage will help in the long run. They argue it's a "livable wage", when in reality prices get bumped up and they'll just call for another raise in minimum wage to offset that.	20
0	I've never been homeless, but I had a job where I had to spend all day outdoors, in the boondocks, rain or shine, walking or in an open vehicle. In those circumstances, when you get a chance to eat, you'd better load up, because you don't know when your next chance will come.	20
0	But the thing is, they don't need it. It's like giving subsidized housing to someone who already owns their own house.	20
0	chicken wings in my store cost more than any other pieces, usually $3.89 a pound.  breast at $1.99 is a bargain in my store.  whole chickens are $10-$14 each and I recall not long ago $3.99  worse, you can't eat worse food than cheap chicken (hormones and antibiotics)	20
0	It's not. I'm just trying to say viewing anything in the most extreme way will lead to inaccuracy.	20
0	Anyone using that argument is ignorant about business, especially food service which has really thin margins.  They assume all business owners are rich and can afford to absorb these wage hikes themselves, when the truth is they have to raise prices because the wage increases would erase the slim profits they were making.	20
0	Like choosing to vote for someone who wants to implement national healthcare.	20
0	But seriously, its obvious there's agendas on all sides, but show me an example of Christians (not Republicans or Tea Party) that tried to make something illegal or carry out their own judgment of their law. Similar to a Muslim beheading someone because they drew a picture of Muhammad.	20
0	Don't you remember? It was a movie theater full of Nazis.	20
0	&gt;Islam has many different sects.  They all worship a pedophile warlord as their prophet. Let's judge them based on that.	20
0	SHHH! Please don't tell the truth as it will offend our guest idiots.	20
0	Less government involvement in the markets outside of regulating anti-competitive practices.   And, I think more importantly, getting corporate interests out of the pockets of politicians.	20
0	That's one way, but it isn't realistically going to happen. I'm of the opinion of of the black community wants to destroy itself, that's the growing pains it has to deal with. If you aren't part of that, you need to move away from it. Baltimore, Ferguson, ect shouldn't receive federal funding for repairs, since it was self-inflicted, not some random natural disaster. I think that is a good starting point, but "white" people coming in to tell them how to correctly run their lives isn't effective and hasn't really been effective for a long time.	20
0	There aren't enough jobs for full employment in any market economy, so even with consistently good 'choices' (whatever that might mean), there will still be a pool of unemployed people necessitating some form of welfare.	20

0	The CNN Obamabot's unmitigated need to discredit this story is enough make the casual observer believe there must be something to this.	20
0	So you also believe that fucking a nine year old and marrying a six year old is a respectable and tolerable action for a middle aged man? Because that's what Muhammad did. Muslims openly worship this pedophile as their holiest prophet. It's disgusting and you should be ashamed for condoning this and attempting to obfuscate the truth.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisha	20
0	Well McDonald's doesn't accept food stamps so your entire argument is not valid.  Healthy food is more expensive than cheap food, plus the majority of the country is obese whether they are on food stamps or not.	20
0	I forget who said it, but the idea is that "being poor is a choice". There are all kinds of ways of getting out of poverty, but you have to really want it and do the work that's necessary. Those who are in it are there because they chose it once you strip away all of the rationalizations and excuses, chief among them it being somebody's fault other than their own.	20
0	Well, that's incredibly glib.  It's not just about the price of food.  It's about the cost of preparing the food.  Most people on welfare have at least one job.  Sometimes, you get off of your day job and have to choose between shopping and making dinner or sleeping before your night job.  It's a terribly choice to have to make.	20
0	because they're idiots.	20
0	Leading to the 60% that are not obese	20
0	Yah.  The idea that food stamp recipients don't work is incredibly simplistic and wrong.  As you can see in [this Wall Street Journal article](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/04/13/get-a-job-most-welfare-recipients-already-have-one/), most people on food stamps receive one or more paychecks and *still* can't make ends meet because wages have not increased at the same rate as food, utilities, and other goods.  You can have two minimum wage jobs and still be in poverty.  The biggest abuse of welfare is big corporations using the welfare system to avoid paying their hourly employees a living wage.	20
0	SNAP isn't the only kind of welfare.	20
0	Your comment doesn't encourage engaged thinking. It encourages illogical, merit less thinking.	20
0	and now they're on welfare.	20
0	Not one full time job, two or more part-time jobs.  And there aren't hour limits to receiving SNAP.  In fact, you have to be working at least 20 hours a week to receive SNAP for more than 3 months in a 3 year period, unless you're disabled.	20
0	40 hours a week at minimum wage isn't a basic living wage, especially with a family, especially if you're a single parent, so you would still be eligible for welfare of many kinds.  In fact, people work more than 40 hours a week and still won't have a basic living wage.  People on welfare definitely aren't obese because they're eating too much.  They can barely make ends meet, even with paychecks and welfare.	20
0	It's not the amount you eat, it's what you eat.  They could have 3 square meals a day, like the average American.  If all of those meals are cheap, fast, convenient fast food, it's going to make you obese.	20
0	Barely anyone hires for full time.  Companies rather have a large easily replaceable pool of people who who they'll schedule for 18 hours a week at the most rather than a lower pool of full time employees.  So, to earn any sort of rent and food, you need to juggle multiple jobs, and somehow convince them all to schedule you in a sane manner so that your jobs don't overlap, and hope you still have time to spend with loved ones .	20
0	because then they wouldn't be worker bees who didn't question their leaders and god(s).  :)    There is no political party/group affiliation who actually want an informed citizenry.  They all want people ignorant in specific ways so that they can attain, and keep, power.	20

0	You're right it isn't, but  &gt; we are telling them they should't let the government run their lives.  Is. You moved the goal posts a bit. As I said earlier, anyone can diagnose the problem, that's easy. As far as a solution, its for the black community to deal with on their own. Constantly stating the facts, as has been going on for many years, doesn't actually do anything.	20
0	Mental illness to that degree is always a tragedy.   The solution, though, should be for the software, not the hardware.	20
0	Denial of basic biological reality is a mental illness, regardless of APA deciding a number of sexual disorders (transgenderism, homosexuality) were no longer mental illnesses.   It is like the Soviet Union labeling dissidents as having sluggish schizophrenia, saying you had to be crazy to deny the socialist utopia (third world disaster they lived in).  The politicization of psychiatry has a horrible fallout, and your friend's hardware solution to a software problem is one of the tragic results.	20
0	I have to question your entire premise here.  Why is race a qualifier at all? You say white people telling black people how to run their lives is ineffective because that is what has been happening and not working.  While seeming true, its actually the ineffectiveness of the government throwing money at black society that should continued to be pointed out no matter the skin color of the individual speaking the truth.	20
0	Exactly most of the red states have way more rural land so lower land costs. Plus the southeast has wide access to ports.	20
0	Your point with that photo was?	20
0	This article fails to take into account that in Christianity there is no specific rule against drawing Jesus.   It's not like Christians haven't acted with violence when something was more so against their moral codes. Take for example the bombing of abortion clinics, or currently Uganda's laws that kill gays.  I'm of course not saying all Christians are bad, but by effect not all Muslims are bad. We should be upset at the extremists.	20
0	Well after reading his tweets I hope that he was going for the satire effect. He's going about it in a way that's counter productive to his cause, but if it is satire this doesn't make it as insane. Still pretty cringe worthy though.

0	Right, so that's why we need immigrant labor.  When the flow of immigrants stopped, they almost had a crisis.  Isn't it clear what happened in that graph?  Business owners stopped increasing wages and kept the money for themselves.	20
0	TBH I can't help but see comments like this as inherently anachronistic. They say that hindsight is always 20/20, but the fact of the matter is that, at the time, most people in the world looked at the same evidence and agreed that Saddam had to go. The invasion was controversial but supported by a large, bipartisan majority and backed by a broad international coalition. The real mistake was in the previous decade when George H. W. Bush did not make regime change a priority immediately after the Gulf War. That's the legacy we're still paying for.	20
0	And they are the ones who do need to be stopped. Once again my message was go after the extremists who cause violence not the ones who are only offended when Mohumand is depicted.	20
0	&gt; In a pre-taped Fox News interview, Megyn Kelly asked Bush whether he’d still send American forces into Iraq, as we did in 2003, knowing now about the faulty intelligence that drove the initial occupation. Not only did he answer in the affirmative, but he suggested Hillary Clinton would do the same.      That's not what happened. Bush was asked if he would have invaded Iraq, to which he said yes just like Hillary Clinton did. How could Ingraham be so misinformed?	20

0	Oh yeah, eggs are dirt cheap too. What is it? $2 for a dozen? That's less than twenty cents an egg. For 1.35, you can eat more than SIX eggs a meal. Canned meat? Also dirt cheap.   Most foods in the grocery store are a luxury. If you want "fresh" meat and vegetables, maybe you should figure out how to pay for your own. It really isn't hard to regularly show up for a minimum wage job. It's the nerve of people who expect taxpayers to pay for those products that bugs me.	20
0	I'm curious if this author, these universities, Christians think they should be allowed to discriminate against interracial couples based on religious grounds. That is the question to ask. You can't logically say you are against discrimination in the case of interracial couples, but for discrimination against gay couples. If it's all religiously based, that argument fails on its face.	20
0	Speaking only for myself and the other Christians whose hearts and minds I know, we don't (and no Christian should) support discrimination based on a couple being interracial.  I find it disgusting that Bob Jones University tried to use Christianity to justify racism.  Sadly, Christianity has been used throughout history to justify a great many things that the Bible never taught.  However, an interracial couple and a gay couple are not the same thing.  The Bible doesn't teach that the mixing of races a sin, but it does teach that homosexuality a sin.  Therefore it is completely logical for Christians to support interracial marriage, but not gay marriage.	20

0	&gt; Religious arguments have no place in law.  **No** place?  I think that's a lot overstated.  The first amendment in our Constitution (i.e. the very foundation of our laws) guarantees that religious freedom will be protected from encroachment by the state.  I think it's clear that there is at least *some* room for religious arguments when considering how laws would impact religious freedom.  However, we need not rely on religious argument alone in this case.  There are several purely secular and logically sound arguments that have been made in support of traditional marriage.	20
0	Which is relevant to what? Marriage was always defined as a man and a woman. The fact that people had prejudices against other races and thus refused to marry them is racism, not changing what marriage is.   Technically speaking, marriage of any kind is not in the constitution, and if you ask me it shouldn't be anywhere except for census purposes.   Edit: instead of downvoting, how about explaining why you disagree.	20
0	But that would require redefining marriage itself. That's not equal protection, that's changing a long standing religious institution.   Edit: Again, instead of downvoting, how about arguing your position.	20
0	Consequently, law has no place in religious arguments.	20
0	So you're saying the word "marriage" hinges on all of those? Seems like a wonky system to me that by changing one word all of that goes out the window.   Marriage is sacred to people, regardless of who recognizes it. Just call it a "domestic partnership" or something along those lines. Heck if a religious couple get married, give them the same license of "domestic partnership" from the state.	20
0	People only believe they deserve it because our government gives out tax benefits and other things to married people. A simplified tax system would eliminate the need for this entirely. Believe it or not, but societies thrived just fine without using marriage as a financial foundation. Marriage, if anything, is a family foundation which is based on a mother and father, from a biological standpoint anyway.   This whole notion of tax breaks and benefits was simply to encourage family growth. Now that our population has grown there's no point in them. Simplify the tax system and allow benefits to be given out as needed, when needed, married or not.	20
0	&gt; Well, where does it say that marriage is between a man and a woman?  It's also biological. Marriage is the foundation of family, and you can't produce a family without a biological father and mother. Society has already thrown that to the curb decades ago when divorce rates spiked and with the amount of single parents out there because the other parents bails on their responsibilities.	20
0	People who fail fertility tests have produced children.	20
0	I believe in allowing children to be raised in the best family situation possible. Statistically speaking, the best place for a child to grow and thrive is a traditional family with the influences of a mother and father and should be the goal for every adoption/surrogate scenario.   I've never understood the need for surrogates when adoption is on the table. Unless surrogates are significantly cheaper, which shows flaws in the adoption system.	20
0	In Biblical times, marriage was for a census and that's about it. If you mean by "and all my worldly goods" that just means that when two people got married they shared their stuff, legally. It didn't have anything to do with Cesar giving the Jews a tax credit for claiming a spouse.   Tax benefits should be for everyone, they should be flat rates with no special treatment to anyone. That way whether you are married, single, parents, whatever, you enjoy the benefits of living in a society that doesn't overtax you for any reason thus allowing you to enjoy things you spend money on.	20
0	Oh good. I see the Republicans still don't have any real claims against Hilary.   My body is ready for Hilary 2016	20
0	Suggesting that the opinions of 9 people should trump statistical science. Their job is to interpret the Constitution, not scientific data.	20
0	And a smaller government would mean that they have nothing to do with religious institutions, taxes or otherwise. Freedom means doing whatever you want with no influence from the government. It doesn't mean milking the government by changing the definition of a longstanding tradition because the government already encroached on something.	20
0	Neither would I, but I would side with statistical science that shows that not having both a father and mother increases the chances for problems.	20
0	That was never the case.   Edit: Instead of downvoting, how about showing where it says that marriage, by definition, is two people of the same race?	20
0	Yeah, I can only hope this means he's going be the candidate to finally axe medicare/medicaid as well.  Worst drain on the planet.  There is absolutely *no* reason to be spending that much on people who are 65+ or who can't afford their own insurance.	20
0	This is Old Testament law. Christians believe that because of Jesus things like keeping marriage within the Jewish nation don't apply to us anymore. Considering the fact that most Christians are not hebrew I don't see how you are making a valid point that applies to us today.	20
0	Because marriage is defined by the consummation between a man and a woman.   Divorce has been blown way out of line for years and is frankly a tragedy.   There is always right and wrong, it's just a matter of what side of the fence you take.	20
0	Anyway don't get too buttfrustrated. Jokes aside, as a registered Republican, I will probably be abstaining from this election cycle.	20
0	I think probably every major country in the world commits some form of Human Rights violations. Some less then others. Obviously countries like Russia and China or regions like the Middle East or Africa commit way more then the US and Europe. But just because things are shit in other parts of the world doesn't mean we have only hold ourselves to that standard. Just because Iran or Russia murders political dissidents doesn't mean that because we don't do that we should just stop trying to improve our own country. We as Americans should hold our country to the highest standards possible if we are going to truly claim that we are a bastion of freedom and liberty.	20

So things like cheating scandals apply to us a greater whole than just wanting to "keeps sports on the sports page!" because something like this is applicable to every part of our culture and society, it's front page news worthy.	20
0	&gt; Matrimony   You do realize that the word Matrimony literally means "the state of being married," right?	20
0	&gt; So is the prohibition against homosexuality.  No - prohibition against homosexuality also appears in the New Testament.   /u/von_stauffenberg was right  - unless you're a Hebrew, the Old Covenant (aka Testament) isn't really applicable (and maybe not even then.)  Christ has fulfilled the Old Covenant and now we are all under a New Covenant in Him.	20
0	Actually, I believe our liberties, religious and otherwise, should be expanded greatly; allowing society, the free market and local governments to have a greater role in determining what is acceptable than the federal government does. What is important to remember, however, is that no matter who is making these calls, right and wrong in the eyes of God is all that matters. I will strive for that, regardless.  I think it's likely the courts will at some point revoke tax exemptions for religious institutions that oppose gay marriage. I believe they will justify it by erroneously drawing the parallel you suggest. I will continue to reject that parallel, regardless.	20
0	No.   So long as Romney paid as much as he owed to the IRS, his tax returns were none of my business, nor were they any reflection of his ability to lead. Personally, I quite liked Romney, and would have preferred him to any of the current candidates- save maybe Paul's stance on the NSA.	20
0	That's a modified definition to fit the narrative. That was only recently added due to pressure from special interest groups.	20

In a sense, you're also not 'dependent' on government here - you're *forced* by the state to send your kids to the school that they tell you to, and you have little say in the matter.   Voucher programs would eliminate that problem, and then you could send the kids to a better school.	20

These are the laws that were meant to establish the Israelites as a separate people, which would include the prohibition against inter-racial marriages.  However, as I mentioned before, homosexuality is *still* prohibited in the New Testament, so there's no question over whether it was merely a ceremonial law.	20

Like so many of the liberals living in Manhattan or attending university, they become so used to being around like minded individuals that when the have a rare encounter with something or someone they disagree with, their atrophied brains are incapable of rationally absorbing information they're not used to.

0	Actually modern rail infrastructure is highly connected to the controls and responsibilities of the train driver. See: [ATP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_train_protection) and [European Train Control System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System). A train isn't like a bus or a car where the controller just looks at a speed limit sign and adapts to that speed.	20

0	I honestly don't care if I get downvoted but if someone believes that they could interact with the world better as the opposite sex what is wrong with letting them do so? What's the worst thing that can happen if a boy who thinks they should be a girl uses a girls' lockerroom? Do you guys also want to prevent gay kids from using the lockerrooms because they're attracted to the sex they're changing next to?	20
0	&gt;And I believe that any conservative who doesn't have a problem with the current police situation either hasn't thought it through or they're an idiot.   You really think this?	20
0	How do you feel about her changing in front of a girl that is attracted to her? There's no way you will be able youll prevent lesbians from changing in the girls lockerroom. So if there is a physical male because of genitalia, with long hair, wears girls clothing, and wears makeup who is attracted to boys how is that harmful to your daughter?	20
0	One begins to believe Allah is indeed a third rate, low caliber not so supreme being. Imagine you are the god of the universe, creator of the cosmos, fount of the great monotheistic religions. Imagine, too, you want some little thing done on a small, insignificant planet on the edge of a not too impressive galaxy in a limitless universe sprinkled with countless star systems. Now, why would you even dream the Iranians could accomplish this thing?	20

0	Bobby Jindal I can't stop laughing. I have to applaud you for sticking by your choice. Rand and Scott are my choices.	20
0	You're still stating that it was an infrastructure problem.  The accident didn't happen because the track was old. The accident happened because yet another union employee was unqualified for the job.  IT DOES NOT MATTER if the track is out of date.  IT MATTERS that the engineer failed to control that train.  &gt; but even if it did i bet it was minuscule in comparison to the total amount.  *You don't say*.  It was human error so take your pathetic talking points somewhere else; perhaps /r/politics where you and like-minded fools can convince each other that the solution to every problem is more money.	20
0	I understand where you are coming from, I really do. But I'm just saying they act like a girl in a lot of ways and a lot of the time you wouldn't know that they were physically male because they just seem like a girl.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mD_eBMIxTjo    If you didn't know that was a biological male before you watched the video I'm sure you'd think that he/she was a little girl by the way she looks, speaks, and just is. But once again I can understand why people feel uncomfortable with transgender people if they don't interact with them regularly.	20
0	Of course I'm not suggesting that invading Iraq had no repercussions.  I am, however, asserting that it's absurd to allege that someone who hasn't been in office for nearly 7 years is responsible for a terrorist group that formed less than a year ago (6 years after Bush left office).  I'll take this even further and point out the fact that terrorist organizations are more than ready, willing, and able to emerge without using American influence as a scapegoat.  Islamists don't need American invasions to drum up support to recruit new members to fight for an Islamic caliphate.	20

0	~~ISIS would still happen even if Bush hadn't invaded Iraq. In fact, I'm going to throw out a guess that the US soldiers in Iraq had probably caused the leader of ISIS (who is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi) to delay their actions for a while, not to mention that they were probably waiting for an ample opportunity to strike.~~  ~~When the Arab Uprising happened, they knew it was time...~~  I stand corrected.	20
0	He does though. He got the stock market back to all-time highs, gas prices are down, everyone has healthcare coverage now, unemployment is like, 6% or less, and there's no war in Iraq despite our soldiers still fighting and dying over there. Oh, and the housing market recovered, and there are now more college students than ever. Obama did all that.	20
0	Except that within a year of the US leaving, the rebranded insurgency came back and took half the country. Policies such as the Sons of Iraq were actually working; the follow through, such as ensuring the parliaments didn't ruin that, was not. American certainly can certainly ensure that an insurgency is kept down, but their policies indirectly and directly resulted in the same insurgency rebounding.	20

The group participated in the Iraqi insurgency, which had followed the March 2003 invasion of Iraq. In January 2006, it joined other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council, which in October 2006 proclaimed the formation of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI)."

0	Lincoln's war severely damaged the power of the States and hugely boosted the power of the federal government. If you're a conservative, you should appreciate the fallout of the Civil War and its impact on the balance of government. Abolishing slavery makes for a heroic cause when you impose modern-day morality on the 1800's, but what was the price? An *incredibly* bloody war, a destroyed infrastructure (mostly in the South), and a roided-up federal government that impacts (negatively, IMO) the future of our country today.	20

Sometimes things happen in life that you don't want to re-visit until it's healed/processed. Sexual violence is a MAJOR problem in colleges, and for young women in general.  The kid needs help; but to say that consideration of this topic is "ridiculous" just betrays you as someone who has never experienced empathy for a day in your tiny sheltered life spans.	20

0	Requiring some kind of 'proof' that systemic discrimination affects someone long after the last incident is telling. It tells me they are clearly white and more than likely male because anyone who is actually familiar with racial prejudice or discrimination would know it stays with you for life and affects more than just the individual; it affects entire families, entire communities.  I'm too experienced with the internet to run around like a faithful puppy fetching information for you to dismiss. Give your downvote and move on.	20

0	Same, but I think he's just extremely naive. Nobody can honestly be this stupid.	20
0	&gt; Nobody can honestly be this stupid.  You're right.  The only logical deduction is that he is doing this shit on purpose and acts ignorant.  He's got to have a motive here, but it doesn't have to stem from his religion, or lack thereof.  Honestly, Obama is probably an atheist asshole who has one god--himself.	20
0	And he set the precedent that the federal government may destroy your state if your state wishes to secede, thereby stripping the States of a huge bargaining chip. It used to be the federal government had to answer to the States. After the civil war, the States had to answer to the federal government.  No, Lincoln didn't single-handedly bloat the federal government. He just paved the path for bloating the government. Since then, he has been aided by such "heroes" as FDR (who has some good points) and LBJ (my least favorite president).	20

0	No one wants to see any terrorist succeed.  But if there was another major terrorist incident the liberal still cannot admit fault in their policies.  First step is to obscure the facts so as not to make it appear as an isis or muslim act.  And if that doesn't convince the useful idiots then they spew excuses galore regarding how it wasn't really their insane policies that exposed the country to unnecessary danger.  I think as conservatives we can always say, "hey that was a good idea, but we were wrong.  It didn't work."  A liberal would never say that because they follow their ideology as a religion.	20

Blaming Obama for ISIS makes people look delusional and ignorant.  I am sad that a good conservative like yourself is falling into such a trap.	20
0	If the Marxists are playing the long game (slowly implement Fabian Socialism, then Socialism, then Communism), it works. The more consolidated the economic power is in a handful of corporations, the easier to nationalize those industries when you finally do.   But this Trans-Pacific Partnership deal particularly, is just a means to an ends. It's not about corporations for Obama. It's about the secret guest worker program being added, which combined with amnesty, is going to be a huge stream of new voters for the left.	20

Not saying that a parent can decide to kill an unwanted child, but the whole "the child didn't get a say" is a falacy.	20
0	Doesnt matter. The argument was "the child didn't get any say in what to do with its body" and as it is now, children already don't get any say in what to do with their bodies  And on that note, what about adults. If I want to smoke weed all day in my own personal residence, why is that illegal. Why can the govt tell me what to do with my body. I don't even have a fetus living inside me.	20

0	You're arguing that abortion is perfectly acceptable simply because they cannot feel pain. They're human beings from the moment of conception and the Bible confirms it.	20

0	The US isn't in a recession? Since when?	20
0	&gt;Although the system is clearly immature and much development is still to occur (fig 1), good evidence exists that the biological system necessary for pain is intact and functional from around 26 weeks' gestation.  Right, but the article also says when the apparatus to feel pain is complete in most fetuses, at 26 weeks. Either way I definitely agree with the conclusion that fetal pain should not be discussed in regards to abortion counseling.	20

0	Nice downvoting comments you disagree with. [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)   I agree the left is insane with "politically correct" BS, but lets not pretend there haven't ever been violent christians, atheists, jews, etc in modern history (Even if the Islamic violence rate is a much higher number and a bigger problem.) That is absurd.	20
0	This should be the only question when deciding if you personally believe abortion is right.  However since it is a question with many opinions and no scientific consensus no one else should be able to tell someone else what they are allowed to believe.	20
0	Agreed. Life in supermax without parole is a much harsher punishment. Plus, this could make him a martyr.	20
0	Okay? Does that make them in any way a real threat to U.S.? We have given them plenty of reasons to hate us and attempt to undermine our actions there. However, their military doctrine in one of defense, as reported by the Pentagon, and the only "threats" they've made have been what they would do *if they were attacked.* Sorry, but this doesn't keep me up worried at night. What does worry me is our out of control spending and ballooning debt. I don't see any of the establishment candidates having any meaningful solutions to these more pressing problems.	20
0	Yes, it should be your choice to be plowed and from their you take responsibility for your actions.	20
0	She's very popular in the mainstream media for standing up against the bully she had an extra-marital affair with.  Also she got a ton of money in the lawsuit, so there's that too.	20
0	No, there is scientific consensus that a fetus can live outside the mother around 26 weeks, maybe slightly earlier.  So I think we can have a law around that time, when there is actually a scientific reason to do so.	20
0	Maybe costa Rico...  It is America after all	20
0	I would probably want more specifics about the situation and some consensus from the scientific community about what is happening.  Chances are I would not support that law with my current outlook since no fetus at 4 weeks has any human characteristics and I don't believe a ball of cells has rights that trump the woman's, but again this is opinion territory, not something I want the government involved in.	20
0	There are Christian and Jewish people just as extreme. The real problems are religion and the left are putting people into small groups and telling them that they are being threatened. Conservatives have made christians feel just as threatened so we really aren't any better in that regard	20
0	One day we'll be able to save that life and let them choose. One day.  But until then, it's not ethical.	20
0	I think this downplays actual Christian extremist organizations like the KKK.	20
0	I'm not really backing off, your hypothetical is never going to happen, 4 week fetus viability, sure it may go to 20 weeks or something and we can reconsider then.  It is easy to argue in hypotheticals trying to disprove someone else's opinion, but so far you have given absolutely nothing to back up your opinion.  Like I've said many times, this debate is full of opinions and very little science and unless you can scientifically prove to me that a fetus is a living human I don't want the government making decisions for us.  Edit: less harsh...	20
0	&gt;And Reddit will eventually die when we get sick of it and go somewhere else.   9gag?	20
0	It's not exactly true, as far as the characterization of Christian extremist anyway.	20
0	&gt;How about we remove the child from the mother and if it wants to live it can?  And this is the point where you went full retard.	20

0	We execute way more people than that in this country.	20
0	Not you specifically, but to the general reader. Look up Cathars, Huegonots, Knights Templar, etc. They were regarded as extremist, even heretics by other Christians. And they were persecuted quite severely.	20
0	Yes, he was found guilty, fairly. That doesn't mean we have to kill him.	20
0	Let him be feminine. The moral high ground approach of your average liberal. Off with his head.	20
0	Well...yeah.....if you don't wanna tax your critical thinking skills beyond a basic eyeball test I guess	20
0	Well, how was it? Any different than now?	20
0	I don't want him to die regardless of the cost of the legal fees for death row.	20
0	Well considering I don't live in Texas, you know the area you brought up and that we're talking about, I can't because I don't have any access to their TV stations. Pretty sure that's your responsibility considering you're the one who brought them up.	20

0	yeah but the fetus will never know it existed so what the hell does it matter?	20
0	Normally I'd be all in favor of this but given who he is and what he stands for and believes in, I don't think I like this decision.	20
0	I really wish they'd execute him immediately so the liberals don't lie and use this as an excuse to say the death penalty is more expensive than life in prison. They artificially inflate the cost by including legal appeals, etc.	20
0	Typical abused spouse response. "He is nice to me most of the time".	20
0	What the hell... You literally posted this a couple minutes after I did...   But still, I'm happy he got the death penalty. Every appeal he makes. Every bit of hope he puts into an appeal will be shit down. The look on his face is going to be enough to make the victims who were injured or died feel they got justice.	20
0	What do you mean it wasn't for Timothy McVeigh??? It took 6 Years and 13.8 million dollars of taxpayer money, including 6.7 million for lawyers alone.	20
0	No, he named one... You lose.	20
0	Jewish extremists persecute Palestinian muslims on a daily basis.	20
0	Great he named someone......without evidence. Hey, look, Rand Paul loves getting penetrated by latino cock. See the problem? If you're gonna claim someone supports something you damn well better provide evidence for that claim. Based on your logic I'm going to continue telling people Rand Paul loves that latino cock	20
0	The difference... We all know he is right. And don't lecture to me about logic, as you commit the logical fallacies of false-equivilence and weak-analogy in the same sentence, genius.	20
0	IMO: Abortion should be legal up to 20 weeks unless there is little chance of the baby surviving  birth. [This post broke it for me.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/35zghk/i_had_an_abortion_at_27_weeks_the_house_20week/)	20
0	How? If they're in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, and they're under close watch by armed guards for the remaining hour, they pose no immediate threat to the overall population. I can't think of a single person so dangerous that, even while under these conditions, he'd have to be executed to protect the public.	20
0	I agree with you that it is a question of what a person deserves. I think he deserves death, but I was just trying to explain to the person I responded to how in reality, the death sentence is more expensive than life in prison. That's all. He's trying to say that the death penalty is cheaper and the cost is "artificially inflated", which is just ignoring reality. Until the legal fees, transportation, and expert witness testimony fees are reduced, there's nothing artificial about it.	20
0	I mean yeah obviously, the point I was making was that I don't want to see people parading his face and story around for years to come. I mean Dahmer got popped pretty quick in prison, but they still managed to get a fucking two hour televised interview out of him. Fuck that	20
0	Until the taxpayers no longer have to pay for the legal fees for attorneys, transportation of criminals, security for witnesses, payment for expert testimony, and death row incarceration, the costs are REAL. As in, REAL people pay REAL money in REALITY.   If you want to make the argument that the system is wasteful and costs are inflated then by all means do so, because that's a strong argument.	20
0	God this is lazy logic.	20
0	No problem lol, of course in no way should our justice system be determined by costs. Justice should always be served based on the nature of the crime. It's just a sad state of affairs that these scumbags cost so much money to convict.	20
0	Why should he? Did he remember that the people he tried to blow up are the very people who will pay for his survival with their tax dollars?   There is no further due process.	20
0	Yeah, I believe the original plan was to make the subsidies much more robust than they currently are, using higher taxes on the upper class to fund them.	20
0	Yup, we should do "life without parole" that just works so well! Just like another very famous Boston case where a child killed (choked with a gasoline rag), raped, then sealed in a barrel and dumped in a river by 2 men, now up for parole hearings. Justice!  http://www.wcvb.com/news/convicted-child-rapist-killer-granted-parole-hearing/32607158	20
0	Agree with that until "Christian". I exclusively see Christians upvoted and atheists downvoted in recent times.	20
0	Just going to add on to this that Islam is actually really peaceful when it not being used by extremists. (The Qur'an actually mentions that Muslims should be tolerant of other peoples)  As well as that Christianity has its own needless violence, see Crusades.	20
0	&gt; Uh... name me one kicker who can make that field goal, after I've moved the goalposts another 300 yards away.	20
0	The original question is about the promotion for decapitation so, as you've admitted, this video doesn't answer the question. That was all that I was asking about	20
0	Great. The whole point is once the sperm hits the egg, the process begins. any interference in that process is terminating a life. Those of us who have thought the issue through, are fine with contraceptives used properly and not as an excuse to fuck constantly with reckless abandon, and we recognize that life begins at conception.	20
0	&gt; voters really aren't that wrong.  We *maybe* had negative growth in Q1 but, we can't say for sure even though we're a month &amp; a half into Q2.  Following that, we're a month &amp; a half away from receiving the incomplete Q2 numbers &amp; from all this, we're to infer that there's most probably, maybe, a definitive recession?	20
0	Also jumping over to the devil, perchance abortion would prevent a child that wouldn't be able to survive or would put the mother at risk	20
0	I am against the death penalty, rotting is so much more of a punishment. But considering his Muslim values, I won't lose sleep over it.	20
0	Yes I am saying the persecution of gays has been done under the name of Christianity   And no the Crusades were the Pope asking European Catholics to reclaim the Holy Lands from "infidels", so the Christians marched towards Jerusalem and killed Muslims and "pagans" along the way  And yes the Qur'an does use texts from the Old and New testament which is why Christians and Jews are "the people of the book" and were treated better than everyone but Muslims in Islamic Caliphates	20
0	No he only said that when you are intentionally assaulting an ethnic group and know they'll react with violence then you shouldn't be upset when the violence doesn't happen because you had every opportunity to stop	20
0	Right, and I'd be happy if my tax money went to the 1000 dollars that the death penalty would cost. You can have your tax money go to the judicial process of his unlimited appeals.	20

0	&gt; It gets old being tormented as a "baby murderer" when in my mind we are not taking lives as the fetus cannot even create it's own cohesive thoughts.  Are the elderly and infirm not human life, then?	20

0	This is an issue where conservatives are logically inconsistent. Why not allow these illegal immigrants to also gain citizenship as police officers, or firefighters, or vote ballot counters, or IRS employees, or any other type of government job? Do they not trust these illegal immigrants to enforce their laws, handle their votes, or send out their tax forms? They seem to trust them just fine with our military equipment, defending us from attack or attacking our enemies.   Leftists and conservatives share some common ground in regards to illegal immigrants, they both view them as tools for their ideological agendas, but don't really care about the immigrants themselves.	20

0	Actually, most liberals, progressives, and dems are OK with guns. We only see the obnoxiously loud minority and politicians pushing an agenda.  I'm personally OK with guns. I own a 9mm and a shotgun. Banning guns is a silly concept that won't actually eliminate guns, just as banning drugs didn't stop the drug trafficking from being so prevalent.	20
0	No. Pleading the fifth is usually a last resort, or one later on down the line.   These leftist liars are in the free speech business. Comedians, reporters, authors, musicians, actors, "artists"...All of them take that privilege and right and abuse it when they lie, or produce filth or obfuscate or run interference for a politician, or fail to report something. Knowing all the time they have, like the sleazeballs in Lethal Weapon 2, "diplomatic immunity". But in this case it is Constitutional protection.	20

0	All of my kids pretended to be the other gender fairly young in life. They grew out of it probably because I didn't base their entire life around their juvenile thought experiment.

Surely you had some idea you would be facing uncomfortable subjects?  I mean if you're going to take pointless classes there's so many amazing courses that aren't controversial. I took fun ones like popular art and architecture in America. Even if you wanted to get into history there's so many things not covered in regular history classes. You can learn things like early Russian history.	20

If a company is dumb enough to pay her to blather on about inane crap then I guess they can spend their money however they want.	20

Is the problem the law or the kid with no father who starts dealing at age 12, is arrested multiple times before they are 18 and then arrested multiple times after they are 18?   Is the problem the war on drugs or that nobody is learning from others mistakes among a culture that promotes gangster and street cred as cool and something they should aspire to obtain?	20
0	I would wager that it is because they have been told it is OK.  Look at where most muslim terrorists come from.  Now look at the literacy rates in those places.  When you have nothing, and feel as if you will always have nothing, and someone who is trusted within your community tells you that your religion offers you a way out and you know only what he tells you because you cannot read the holy books for yourself....  Only a small percentage of Muslims ever become terrorists, and if their book is correct, they are each and every one of them being doomed to hell by the worst kind of religious leader: the political one.	20

0	The fact remains that out of 200,000+ hydraulically fractured horizontal wells around the globe, there have been 4-5 known instances when fracking–because it was done over an active fault–caused an earthquake.

0	This really is a common theme that everyone needs to understand.  Rand was right then on not only this, and he's right now.  His foresight and tenacity should be a lesson to all.	20
0	Liberals love centralized planning no matter how off the rails the results. Somehow allowing individual autonomy is anathema to the statist. Better to put your life and schedule in the hands of a union member with a fat government guaranteed pension.	20
0	"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."  Most of the time the quote is posted without the patriots part, but you left out tyrants, which is equally important.  Edit: Just wanted to correct the quote, not trying to make the statement that /u/DonVito1950 is.	20
0	I agree. DC is crazy expensive. Plus, if you're a successful attorney, businessman, or whatever, becoming a Congressman shouldn't be a demotion.	20
0	This is true. A friend of mine went from making $50k in Upstate NY to making $80k in DC and his net take home is going to be less. Only reason he made the move was for a better health insurance plan.	20
0	The fuck kind of third world country expects its elected representatives to live with roommates and survive on ramen noodles?	20
0	So? I didn't say they defended him from public scrutiny, I said it defended his free speech. The university is allowed to make a statement against one of their employees. Any organization or business can do that. They didn't fire him, though, and that's the key differentiator. They kept up their end of the bargain.	20
0	I found it especially interesting since the Washington Post is usually a very Liberal newspaper.     Conservative speeches are usually more uplifting and inspiring than Liberal speeches, which tend to be dour and pessimistic.	20

It's a fucking no brainer. Liberals are idiots to claim that their jobs will be taken offshore.   On that last note, isn't it kinda racist to complain that someone in another country will be getting a job? I dunno... Seems kinda hypocritical for the liberals to be against that.	20
0	You sure? There's no way I could pass a drug test. :-o  But I hear what you mean about individual congressmen (or women).   I wonder what percentage of Americans even know what their congressman is doing or how they're voting?	20
0	Yes but they often have to have a home in DC, and in their home state,  im not saying they should get paid more or anything like that, but they do have higher required costs of living than nearly anybody else. they also tend to profit from outside sources, but the ones that keep them selves honest, shouldnt have to be pushed out of office, due to cost restrictions	20
0	I attend the University of North Texas in Denton and throughout the school there was hardcore fracking ban rhetoric that was just nauseating. And then the professors that were in favor of it clearly didn't care to hide it. It's a good thing I'm on the 'correct' side of campus now with like minded people that can see through the left's emotional rhetoric.	20
0	True.  Any campaign finance reform that would actually pass would virtually guarantee that incumbents would increase their reelection rate from the current 85-90% to 98%.	20
0	What legislation did Obama cram down your throat that congress didn't pass?	20

0	&gt; As we see articles coming to light by people raised to adulthood by same sex parents, we get a glimpse of what family life is like. Most have spoken of the parents being overly sexual in front of the children, and that sex and sexuality is improperly prioritized above other things more critical to raising a child.  What goes through your mind before you just make something like that up out of thin air? Talk about a mental disorder.   &gt;I don't even understand some of the more complex parts of human sexuality  No shit.	20

0	In fairness, it's an article based entirely on hearsay. I don't know Chelsea.

Chelsea being difficult to work with is not really an issue, either - is it? There's no law against being a jerkface.

0	What is it with conservatives and stupid ideas about government?  Is it really your goal to make it so people have to be even ***richer*** in order to join Congress? Come on. Surely you realize that all this would do is make absolutely sure that only the people who were planning on becoming lobbyists or who have mountains of cash would ever run for Congress.  I'm further right than most the people I know, and my plan to fix Congress would include at ***least*** doubling their pay.	20
0	what's the average net worth of a congress person?	20
0	As opposed to congressmen taking billions from domestic lobbyists? Seriously, what's the difference?	20
0	Why exactly is higher minimum wage bad? If wages, which business lobby to keep low, are as such that working 40 hours is still below the poverty level then why have subsidies for the businesses.   The employees are on welfare because the business want higher profits, when it would benefit the majority and be cheaper overall to just have higher wages leading to more spending by consumers and a better economy.   Don't blame liberals when you hshould be blaming lobbyists and the politicians who take they're money.	20

0	Besides, a church can marry two men that is not the same as the State recognizing it.	20
0	Yea that is a poor way for me to word it.  I would like to strike that and replace it with "I consider it hypocritical for the government to only recognize certain religions' marriages over others."  Freedoms aren't taken away.  What are your thoughts? I've posed some questions but they're still unanswered.	20
0	The religion doesn't matter...it's not like Catholic marriages are recognized but not Protestant ones.	20
0	I agree religion shouldn't/doesn't matter.  But like, why should the government care at all?  Any position it takes will pretty much ensure some group will have a disparity between what they call a marriage and what the gov calls one.  There are religions that have polygamous marriages and the gov certainly doesn't recognize those.  So the gov does in fact pick and choose who to recognize.	20
0	Ok but we're not talking about blood rituals. We're talking about gay marriage	20
0	The subject is religious freedoms being 'violated.'	20
0	That's Gallup, Pew has seen it differently: http://www.charismanews.com/us/45496-despite-legal-wins-gay-marriage-support-declining  And yes it is unfortunate that there are so many moronic Americans, including that senile old bitch Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who support it.	20
0	Nothing was 'derailed' except whatever errant point you attempted to make.	20
0	Exactly - media propaganda has been pushing gay stuff since at least the late '80s or early '90s. It's a shame that so many Americans are unable to have opinions the media doesn't give them.	20
0	I love that the new bipartisanship is "let's waste time together." At least we have that.	20
0	"Liberals" call it "progress."	20
0	What we need is a good strong conservative leader. Bush's support for real marriage and his personal unpopularity were strong reasons some people started supporting gay "marriage". Obama lives and breathes gay propaganda, even going as far as to push it on third world countries, so once he's out of office and we get someone who's not insane (like Rand Paul or Ted Cruz) hopefully that will change some minds.  It's hardly inevitable - nothing really ever is.	20
0	Maybe because Coolidge was the executive in the term preceding the Stock Market crash of 1929. So,  one may want to avoid that comparison.	20
0	If Jeb can pull some of the greens then I'd say he's better than Hillary. Or you were thinking, maybe, Carson can win?	20

0	As Mark Levin said tonight, his real purpose was to go there and literally demoralize, confuse and disrespect the Coast Guard.   I would have walked out.   There are those that fight evil, and there are those that fight ~~globull warming~~ clie-mate change.	20
0	Because it really isn't. People ignore actual numbers and substitute ones they pulled out of their ass. Like the entire, "Look how great Sweden is!" But when you look at the numbers, the nations that are closer to capitalism are thriving. Switzerland and Germany have a little bit of a socialist element, but Japan is pretty capitalist and all three are doing pretty good. Especially in the case of Japan, which was a desolate wasteland after WWII, now rebounding into 3rd place on the economic-size ladder.	20
0	In California it does. If the activists have spent 1/10th the money they have on "gay marriage" civil unions would be up to par in all 50 states with little to no controversy.	20
0	Eh, Germany has a lot of socialism. More than us in some ways but they don't spend as much per capita as far as I know. The state has outlawed home schooling and secondary schooling is not entirely upto the student. Japan has a lot of debt for it's size. They keep trying to kickstart their economy with government spending.	20
0	They've even published a playbook, back in 1989. http://www.amazon.com/After-Ball-America-Conquer-Hatred/dp/0452264987 Biased as fuck, but it's worth reading if you want to get an idea of what they're doing and how people are backing them up.	20
0	While I applaud Rand Paul for doing this, I actually hope the filibuster fails. I really doubt the patriot act would be re-signed, and this would provide an excellent opportunity to show who we should not be voting for.	20

0	You might want to try /r/ask_politics or /r/PoliticalDiscussion.  /r/conservative is more for polite discussion than debate.  We do allow self posts, however we expect you to kick off the discussion with your take on an issue instead of simply asking an open-ended question.	20
0	That's exactly right.  I feel the only republican canidate she has a hope of defeating is Jeb.  Therefore we should go as conservative as we can with a Walker-Rubio ticket!	20
0	Um, you guys do remember that it was Bush and the Republicans who created the Patriot Act in the first place right?	20
0	zero balance. can you read?	20
0	I also liked huntsman. All of the other republican candidates for their time in the sun until their dirty laundry dragged them down. Its a shame huntsman didn't get his chance.	20
0	I agree. I prefer Bernie, and would Vite for him, but basically only because he isn't Hilary. He is just as nutty as Ron Paul, and should get the same kind of attention this year as well.	20
0	&gt; Let's not become like the left.   ...links to dailycaller.com, may as well be progressive.org.	20
0	so, my popularity is a HAIR lower than number 10 = my vision for America is worthless, even to "fair and balanced" FOX.  but I'm betting Jebster will receive preferred placement on that stage	20
0	Why? She doesn't rail against them for the wealthy, such as herself.	20
0	Sidebar: This is not the place to debate and challenge Conservatism.	20
0	If you only post an open-ended question it's not going to be approved.  You might want to try posting to /r/ask_politics with "Question for Conservatives - " at the beginning.	20
0	Nothing is wrong with "debate," this is not the forum for it.	20
0	If you cannot follow the rules here then you should find a different venue.  Have a nice day!	20
0	I'd go one step further and say that Hillary and Jeb are both the picks of the establishment powers. It doesn't matter which one of these two would be president to them. They would both serve the ruling class.  We need a serious change from the status quo. A conservative like Rand Paul would be fine by me.	20
0	Maybe read the article. And the phrase "equal rights" is meaningless.  You use it like it is an absolute good.  Should we grant "equal rights" for adoption for convicted felons?  Unless you examine the context then that phrase means nothing.  In this case the context is that homosexual couples are fundamentally different than heterosexual couples, and there is perfectly good reason for different rights to be assigned to each.	20
0	It won't be. If a strong social conservative like him is on the ticket, it will be Bush vs Clinton vs another vote-splitting Libertarian.	20
0	This is why if he becomes the republican nominee for president.I will be convinced that our political and voting systems are rigged.	20
0	That is not answering my question.  Care to look at the thread in question and give me an actual answer as to if the thread is acceptable or not.  Tell me if my post breaks the subreddit rules.	20
0	You didn't answer the question in that link either, and my question still goes unanswered.	20
0	1. Restrictions on speech - maybe he doesn't refer to the exact legal code here, but I'm pretty sure this is tangible  2. Restrictions on a child's right to be raised by his biological parents, and his right to be raised by a father and mother  3.  Restrictions on religion or moral values - if you espouse your views on traditional marriage you could face fines or worse   Are you saying these are untrue?  I'm not sure what you mean.  The article is full of tangible effects that have taken hold in Canada.	20
0	Look. Do you think this is going to stop at gay marriage? The Gay agenda will not be satisfied until they have eroded every remnant of appropriate, God given sexual propriety from out country, made it illegal to protest even. This is our reasoning. It is pure logic.	20
0	Read the article and use your English comprehension skills...please.	20
0	like it or not, there is VERY little the separates Jeb from Hillary. They are BOTH for sweeping Amnesty, they BOTH believe in Common Core, they BOTH agree that government should be more encompassing. You CLAIM Jeb has a social conservative streak..... but what are those issues? you ALSO in pointing out the claim of a social conservative streak, have IGNORED his fiscal progressive streak. I lived in Florida under Jeb as Governor. he is a progressive republican who agrees more with Obama than he does Ronald Reagen.	20
0	other than the pro life stance (which ALL of the GOP candidates stand behind) everything you listed are caveats. he is for vouchers but PUSHES common core! and he isnt as gun friendly as you think. And my pointing out fiscal conservatism is not relevant??? OMG I said the ONLY difference (ignoring the fact he is a male and Hillary is a female!) how careless of me.	20
0	They're already rigged, people at the top of both parties are one in the same, bought and paid by  tthe same people to play the two sides against each other.	20
0	stand your ground only applies in your home (unless you have a CWP or open carry) most libs are okay with that because they can regulate WHO GETS those permits. thus regulating Castle doctrine or (stand your ground) to one's HOME. and being limited to owning a firearm in the confines of your home is NOT gun friendly....	20
0	Boy, I hope not. I think that's the path to sure defeat.	20
0	they are both in essence defense for self defense. and again, you need to have a CWP in florida for that stand your ground defense to take affect. they are more alike than you give them credit for. (both good laws mind you), only thing that bothers me is the being relegated to ones home unless you jump through all the hoops to get a CWP.	20
0	Our ruling elite has a different set of rules. Clinton Inc. is completely lawless.	20
0	Only for Fox News.	20
0	By "a father and mother" is what it should have read.  The in vitro is the biological one.  Tried to put two different ideas in the same sentence and did it poorly, sorry.	20
0	There are plenty of people who would argue that being against abortion is "anti women" and that opposing gay marriage is "anti gay"	20
0	Let's face it, MLK was a preacher. He would have been opposed to the gay rights movement like the rest of the clergy is.	20
0	So tired of this 'you think it's bad here, ISIS kills homosexuals" deflection. These are not related issues. He insults everyone's intelligence by thinking they will go along with such nonsense.	20
0	He avoided answering the question entirely. Just say 'no, I don't' and move on.	20
0	I cannot understand how this demagogue gets away with this.   I cannot understand how liberalism gets any support at all.   The absence of common sense makes no sense.  Sorry for the alliteration.	20
0	Asking Cruz if he has animosity towards homosexuals, while a truly idiotic question, still has nothing to do with ISIS. Only a manipulator would connect the two, and only a fool would fall for it.	20
0	What reality is being denied?	20
0	The hand was already played. It went nowhere.   Sorry to seem so cynical about it all, but any scandal emanating from Democrats here is never going to be a scandal.   Were it a Republican president, the media wouldn't stop until they resigned in disgrace, as they should.   When it's Obama and Hillary - nothing to see here. Move along.   I admire your enthusiasm, but we're dealing in the real world here.	20
0	What do liberals have to do with this question he was asked, and the subsequent moronic answer given?  The question was dumb, and his answer was as well.  Both deserve derision.	20

0	I don't understand.	20

0	Not totally familiar with all the details of this, rape is the most fucked up thing in the world so previously I totally supported mattress girl. Was it proven that the dude didn't rape her?	20
0	Cause he is; he feeds on hate and fear and other people's money. He will harm this country immeasurably if he gets anywhere near the WH	20
0	You're just assuming she's not? I understand that in America you are innocent until proven guilty which kind of contradicts my first comment, but rape is torture and torture is the worst thing we can do in a society. There should be zero tolerance for it and I would support publicly shaming that fucking bastard for the rest of his life.  Unless he didn't do it. Which is why I asked the question.	20
0	Unless we set the tone of the echo chamber first	20
0	I dunno maybe she's telling the truth now?	20
0	Sanders is literally Ron Paul. Nobody really likes him outside of the protected confines of whatever social media platforms his supporters can astroturf.  No, Sanders' role is to test the waters for Elizabeth Warren. Get the american public used to outright hostile attitude towards actual capitalism.   It would be one thing if they were just attacking the cronyism and corruption. But they aren't. They're straight up placating dumb people with fantasies that aren't realistic in this country.	20
0	The base votes for the party, not the candidate. That's what makes them the base.  We'll have to see how it plays out in regards to Rubio and Paul. They're both viable, but the big donors seem to have other candidates in mind.	20
0	Sanders. Because he is a self-proclaimed socialist which won't fly with with most Americans. Plus he doesn't get the extra female voters who are on then Hillary bandwagon.  I do sincerely respect his honesty on his positions though. I believe it was Glenn beck who said the same thing and said he would be friends with the guy.	20
0	He's a good fresh face to have on a ticket though- Young, Hispanic and a good speaker.	20
0	In IOWA, dems can switch day of, and caucus with the Republicans ... I hate that.	20
0	That is why we need a Republican like Ted Cruz that actually will stand up and articulate constitutional conservatism.   /r/TedCruz	20
0	So weird.  I feel bad for Stephanopoulas.  I think he had an arrangement with the Clintons which he could not get out of.	20
0	I totally agree, but the conduct of the left on this issue has been abhorrent.  As a result, I literally have to stop myself from opposing them on principle alone.	20
0	I wonder how /r/politics would receive this story. This is onion gold right here, it's 2015 and stories like this still baffle me. LGBT proponents still stand by the as serration that homosexuality is a born trait, genetic, and not a choice. Question them, ask for a scientific source, get shouted down by the hive mind. Suppression at its finest	20
0	How we treat our LGBT citizens in the United states is not the same issue, nor related to, how ISIS treats homosexuals. It's pure cowardice to move the goal posts in this fashion. The fact that someone running for president cornflates an important national issue of liberty/equality, with international threats from a terrorist group, is an intentional dog whistle tactic to avoid the sensitive issue of equality by supplanting it with national defense.   We need to demand more from our representatives and those running for office, and not pander to stupid arguments.	20
0	I just shill for logic. Plain and simple. It's unfortunate you use the liberal boogyman in your argument as opposed to actually addressing his deflection of the question. Equality within our country is a very important discussion. National defense and security are also very important discussions, yet this does not mean they are linked. In this instance, they simply are not.	20
0	When has failure of a big government program meant we should eliminate that program? Just because there are more poor people than ever doesn't necessarily mean we eliminate the welfare state. Just because FBI snooping doesn't make us any safer doesn't mean these programs will end.	20
0	There is no such thing as an "unarmed" confrontation with a police officer. The cop always has a gun which he will lose if he loses the fight. Cops in such situations have no choice but to shoot. The mainstream media needs to figure this out.	20
0	It's also a private company with the basis of free and uncensored and "unbiased" information. This is fairly hypocritical	20
0	Why didn't the Party of Lincoln oppose creation of these ghettos?	20
0	It's worked out that way, but back then it was just about shoving everyone into one location - that wasn't their neighborhood.	20
0	He's argument is that the government was pretty racist to people in the 1930s, 40s and 50s? And this is considering news?  All of this before Brown, before the Civil Rights Movement, all before new anti-discrimination housing laws?	20
0	I was just using an extreme analogy to illustrate a point. Arguing that schools cost too much when you were part of the problem is very hypocritical.   Like I said, it's just par for the course with Warren. With one hand, she knows what to say to rally her liberal base, and with the other she knows how to line her pocketbook doing the exact same thing she rallies against.	20
0	Why is Obamacare bad?	20
0	I don't know, man. I pay a lot less and get a lot more. I'd say that's a check in the win column.	20
0	I would be a lot more open to socialized medicine than I am to Obamacare. We thought what we had before was the worst of both worlds, but then Obamacare came along and accomplished nothing but obfuscation of the real problem, and at tremendous cost.	20
0	I support three of those things.  Just because I disagree with Jeb (or Hillary) on other issues doesn't mean they can't occasionally be right.	20
0	Jeb is pro-life.  That's important to me.    Hillary got the Margaret Sanger award.  It's not the only issue, but it is an important difference.  I wouldn't think I was wasting my vote if I had to choose between them and I voted for Jeb.	20
0	The purpose of the tax is to fund bike path construction.  Bike and pedestrian paths are mandated by the "Complete Streets" law.  Walker opposed this law, but some Republicans floated the bike tax as a means of paying for those accommodations rather than trying to repeal the law.      IMO it makes sense.  If you want special accommodations for bike riders, I'd rather pay for it with a tax on bikes than a tax on everyone whether they use it or not.	20
0	All but NSA spying.  As a confession, I'm totes a liberal.	20
0	We shouldn't have to settle for Isis or Sadam. Bush handled Sadam so obama should've handled isis.	20
0	People who make mistakes are often very credible sources when it comes to telling others the dangers of following in their footsteps. They know the personal freedom that comes from overcoming addictions and other deviant behaviors and they wish to spare others pain by warning them away.	20
0	Because even in low skill jobs there is a difference in skill and customer service between staff   Go to a grocery store and the 50 year old cashier will almost always be more pleasant and knowledgable than the summer employee. Your business would fail if you recycled all your wmployees every 6 months	20
0	I bring it up specifically because the image suggests there is really no difference between the candidates.  I think there are important differences, abortion being an important one for me, between Jeb Bush and Hillary.	20
0	Keg stands for rand.	20
0	This.  /r/Conservative is tired of having a liberal president, but they won't vote for anyone who is not completely politically aligned with them. Who would you rather have? Obama or Romney. Romney wasn't perfect, but he certainly is no Jeb Bush. Voting 3rd party only gives the dems more power. Ted Cruz is very charismatic. He knows how to handle the media. He can give great speeches without a teleprompter. He is very conservative. We shouldn't be so close minded about Ted, or any of the other candidates. Stop complaining about the /r/politics downvoting people for having a different opinion, because it is hypocrisy.	20
0	And now we have a liberal president. I hope it was worth it.	20
0	While I do think that we could do better, I think the ACA is a good start. Also, it was pretty gutted from its original form by opposers, so we're left with some crippled version of it that still seems to do better than without it.	20
0	&gt; /r/Conservative is tired of having a liberal president, but they won't vote for anyone who is not completely politically aligned with them.   Source?	20
0	What progress are they supposed to make? Is this perceived progress supposed to easily make it past filibusters and vetos? What exactly are Republicans in Congress supposed to be doing to make you happy?	20
0	Opposers of the ACA. Those who didn't like it and/or those who just plain opposed Obama.   No one [through history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_health_care_reform_in_the_United_States) seems to be able to agree on a healthcare.	20
0	I have been knowing this, but my ultra conservative parents taught me a whole lot about democrats of yesteryear. And they say the parties have switched...ha!	20
0	What he did was horrible. There's no defending his actions. But what he did after to try to turn his life around and own up to his mistakes is what we should be looking at, as well. Recovered alcoholics and porn addicts can be good people and we shouldn't necessarily eternally condemn them unless we are willing to condemn all people who have made mistakes, no matter what they have done to try to atone for their mistakes.	20
0	I've never heard of this Duggar guy before reading this article. When did he lecture you on family values?	20
0	If only they were gay this would be the trifecta of hate porn for people on this sub	20
0	Why the hell not. Voat is the one getting pushed the hardest. set the new tone and the newly emancipated drones will see new ideas, and since everyone will be in agreement  they won't feel like they have to protect the hive but are being enlightened by the new hivemind	20
0	The news is is that FDR and the progressives who now claim to be the defender of minorities set this up to segregate them and marginalized them. That is what the new narrative is. Also look to Sanger who thought abortion was the answer to weeding out the undesirable minorities.	20
0	Didn't know we could prove negatives now.	20
0	Nobody can lecture you on anything in America that you don't first choose to listen to. That's what liberals forget about when they complain about christians "preaching" or "lecturing" them.	20
0	The point is that everyone involved in this crime receivedreceived the help they needed in order to live productive lives free from further sins in that area. The parents preferred to give all of their children a chance at redemption and happiness instead of putting the one immediately in jail.	20
0	&gt; Also, as I'm sure you're aware, when you get the Government involved you cause prices to rise. Witness education costs.  Why is this only an issue here?	20
0	Republicans will not win if there candidate in 2016 is not for gay marriage.	20
0	What happened to small government and individual freedom?	20
0	Am I the only one who sees nothing wrong with this? If I gave money to a group of people that I later found out were the type I wouldn't want to have my money, and I could get a refund, then why not?	20
0	You can believe whatever y.ou want.  What you can't do is impose your Christian morality on the rest of us.	20
0	I've never said that.	20
0	Education costs are through the roof *in the United States*, not worldwide.	20
0	Let's not make hasty generalizations.	20
0	Come on.   The Daily Mail? That half inaccurate gossip rag?  And you fucking editorialized the title. "SJW"? All it said was that he was an anti-racist blogger.  We don't know this guy's politics. Conservative people can be anti-racist bloggers too. They can even be pedophiles.  This is really low quality post that seems, for all intents and purposes, to be intentionally politicizing something that isn't political to gain a cheap point against liberals.	20
0	I think I understand what you are saying.  Could you cite any specific examples of leftists doing what you have described?	20
0	Policy is the Taser needs more than one cop present. Best outcome is these criminals don't fight the cops in the first place. But that is unrealistic.	20
0	Who cares about the % of gay people. The community is huge and will not vote for a conservative that has backwards views.	20
0	Glenn Beck - Supporting/opposing everything at least once.	20
0	Now the left and Glenn Beck have something they can agree on and he'll soon be a hero to them.	20
0	I cannot see it. Republicans will vote there party and the same with the Dems. The small % in the middle is where it counts. This will be a huge issue in 2016 and the Media will throw it in everyone face. How the GOP is being retarded on this issue is really dumb. There party is going to vote for them no matter what, why they are being backwards on this issue is just puzzling, it is why a lot of people laugh at Republicans.	20
0	If Romney won the nomination, why won't Jeb?	20

0	I have nothing against Rand (other than his isolationism), and would vote for him if he was nominee, but what really makes you say this?  His ideas?  He really has no track record of leadership or accomplishments.  Ideas are great, but let's give him some time to learn if he can turn ideas into accomplishments.  A couple of years as a senator is not enough experience (see Mr. Obama as case study #1).	20
0	Really since gays are a large % of the population! Lol stop pandering to minorities. What's next for libs pedophile rights?	20
0	Romney and Obama were basically the same candidate, same with Obama and McCain. We wouldn't mind it if our candidates at least had SOME conservative views.	20
0	Net "neutrality" is fucking stupid.	20
0	It's the same as Rand Paul's stance. Though Rand has gobe further and favors civil unions granting the same rights to gays as everybody else.	20
0	Yeah but his alternative is rent fixing for corporations, which is the opposite of the free market.	20
0	Ok can someone explain why meth, heroin, cocaine, etc legalization is good?	20
0	I want the internet unregulated, as it is now. That's true net neutrality.	20
0	"Abolishing" net neutrality? No, it's impossible to abolish something that hasn't existed. YOU would be abolishing true net neutrality by allowing the government to regulate a business they don't own. And rent fixing? It's the same thing as health care. If you can afford to pay more, you should get more.	20
0	&gt;So if you take away net neutrality, cable prices will rise and service quality will decline.   a.) That's not what net neutrality actually is. Just a buzzword.  b.) That's not how the free market works.   c.) Historically, that's not how the internet works, either.  You have no idea what you're talking about.	20
0	This is what I've been saying for a long time. We need a black woman conservative candidate like Mia Love.	20
0	a.) Words have definitions.  Try looking them up.  b.) There is no free market in the U.S. Telecommunications industry  c.) That's exactly how it works.  [Educate yourself](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/we-need-real-competition-not-a-cable-internet-monopoly).	20

0	Stupid people don't vote in the primaries.	20
0	The extremely conservative pseudo-nihilism in this thread is absurd. Just because you dislike Obama doesn't mean everything he does is evil and harmful to America. Only supporting candidates like Cruz will only make our problems worse because further left Democrats will be elected.  TPP will be a good deal simply because it continues the concepts of free trade. While I would appreciate the ability to read it, my point still stands.	20
0	I don't need to read the bill because I can just read the reactions of those who have read it. The reactions by progressives like Warren and Sanders make it fairly clear that the bill is similar to NAFTA. I like NAFTA, so I like TPP.  Also, I too want to limit the authority of the president. However, you choose... A trade deal as the battleground? There are so many more important places where I believe constitutional boundaries are being broken, so I fight against those.	20
0	The deal will be open to public viewing once negotiations have finished. What laws are being broken by the president by doing this?	20
0	I do have a clue what's in it, based upon the reactions of those who have read it. If you have any substantial evidence that proves TPP isn't for free trade I'm more than happy to hear it, otherwise I'll just ignore your baseless insults.	20
0	Yes you are because even if all these people are not reelected odds of the treaty being repealed are slim to none.	20
0	&gt;Just because you dislike Obama doesn't mean everything he does is evil and harmful to America.  I can't speak for all conservatives, but I don't dislike Obama, I dislike what he does. That therefore means that I am judging him based on his actions, not because he's black like you're asserting.	20
0	Ok a bunch of lying lib socialists had a positive reaction so you know its good. Haha brilliant logic my friend	20
0	If what you say is true, then you're part of the problem. With all due respect, get your head out of your ass. Decency? Try having some character.	20
0	Yeah, about that. It was a purely political move that had no real affect on Al qaedas operation. Osama was immediately replaced by someone younger and more active. Osama was essentially retired and his damage done. obama released 5 taliban leaders (so 5 osamas) for a known deserter. Sadam was tried and executed publicly. Osama was given an honorable burial at sea. And he was also "found" and killed at a time when obama was sinking in the polls. So killing osama was always intended to be a parachute for obamas plummeting approval ratings. And it appears that a lot of very dim people fell for it.	20
0	Oh come on.  This isn't about "thoughtcrime", it's about hateful speech (which should never be illegal).  Even with complete freedom of speech though, there are still consequences if you go around espousing morally repugnant beliefs.  The answer to hateful speech is more opposing speech, which seems to be just what's going on here.	20
0	Well I feel much better now that a Norwegian has assured me despite me following his track record for the last seven years.	20
0	The degree of socialism is far too high for my tastes. I'm tired of working to support people who don't work or are so lazy or incompetent that they have jobs in name only.  There is a lot more of this here than you think.	20
0	But it will help courts force them to	20
0	I was referencing the recent federal [case](http://www.westernjournalism.com/appellate-court-nails-nsa-spying-and-patriot-act/) against the NSA	20
0	Ya, it's called the executive	20
0	Hahaha I know I know. Being a derpy smart ass. Sorry	20
0	How does she have the liberty to sleep through anything?	20
0	Oh ok "automation investment" was an unfamiliar term. I'm used to hearing investments in capital.   Yea, when McDonald's is making kiosks as a replacement for cashiers then you know they're anticipating for higher future wages.	20
0	It's not just that they push a "different opinion," it's that they deliberately misinform and mislead, and there's absolutely zero objectivity in their "reporting." Like seriously, Glenn Beck?	20
0	A series of tweets is not the kind of news I'm looking for in this sub.	20
0	woosh? Hillary being the first Democrat female to run for president? Cries of sexism when met with any sort of criticism? Just like Obama and racism in 2008?	20
0	&gt; Of course, when a study disproves common sense, that study is almost certainly politically motivated pap.  Do you have any evidence for this claim?   &gt;America has produced generations of welfare recipients who are no more keen to work than Hillary is to produce her secret server.  Again, do you have any actual empirical evidence that proves that people on welfare don't want to work? Because I've just provided some pretty clear cut evidence that the opposite effect occurs.	20
0	I'm no fan or supporter of Hillary, but it was a Saturday. I don't think sleeping in on a weekend is criminal.	20
0	Thanks for the response, and I can definitely see what you mean about cutting the argument short for an op-ed piece which he has otherwise explained in his books. I have never read his stuff before though and it seemed like he was jumping to conclusions with little rationale.	20
0	&gt;There's a reason why silicon valley/the tech world loves telling stupid people on the internet what to think. They're the least altruistic people on the planet, and their uninhibited greed even puts wall street to shame, not to say that they aren't butt buddies to begin with.  Could you explain this a tad? I'm not really sure what this connection is.	20
0	So, they forced people on welfare into slavery, and that cut the rates of people on welfare?   Well of fucking course it did if they bleein' **forced** them to go and work!	20
0	Regular people get fired for sleeping on the job.	20
0	Humans are humans, and they work pretty much the same way in different places. I mean, it's hardly like comparing tribes in the Amazon to Americans. Northern Europe and the US are pretty damn similar.	20
0	Exactly. Give me some depth.	20
0	And if I didn't believe that people weren't terrible and selfish then maybe I wouldn't be a socialist.	20
0	MSNBC explicitly claims to liberal, Jon Stewart is a comedian on a comedy show.  Fox claims to be "Fair and Balanced".	20
0	Come on. Of course they are. The gov't basically sends zero dollars to any black communities in this Country. Esp since around '65 or so. We are a racist Country that should still be beholden to its slave holding past that ended 150 or so years ago. Esp since most Americans have anything to do with slave holding and racism.	20
0	Good ole irrelevant comparison.  Does not make Fox any less pitiful.	20
0	Uh,  the tagline of the channel is Fair and Balanced.... And I've heard their hosts claim to "bring you the news,  and you decide".  Come on now.	20
0	When your labor costs nearly double, things like automated cashier stations start to make a heck of a lot more sense than paying somebody.  Likewise, trying to automate more of the process to make a burger (for instance).  So, if you are in the business of automated cashier stations, a higher minimum wage is great for you.	20
0	You have to do better than this.	20
0	Sweet.  Then they can drop the claims that they present objective news all day, and can drop the "fair and balanced"  (without the word news after,  so there's that) and "real journalism"  slogans if their big hosts are opinion pundits.  I'm nitpicking yeah, just don't see how the channel is defensible.   Msm in general is trash but anyway...	20
0	I could care less,  the whole "Oh well they do it less!"  argument is stupid.  They're all trash pushing their agenda.  Well,  not sure if CNN has an agenda other than displaying incompetence haha.	20
0	I like how no one proves you wrong,  just says "Oh but this media outlet does this!!! Look here!!"  and downvotes.	20
0	MSNBC doesn't claim to be bias, get out with that nonsense. And Stewart uses the "I'm a comedian" shield as an excuse to push his partisanism and tries to be a serious reporter all the time. There's very little comedy, and a whole lot of whining on his show.	20
0	Somehow everyone forgot that in 2008 Romney was the conservative challenger to McCain.	20
0	The MSNBC slogan is "Lean Forward."  What more do you need.  And no, Jon Stewart is a comedian, on a parody news show, on *Comedy Central*.	20
0	The climate changes.  We can go back through the fossil record and prove that for billions of years the climate has not been consistent.  Liberals, however, either honestly believe that humans are the reason for climate change (which is arrogance and bullshit) or see this as an excuse to push their agenda backed by phony science.	20
0	Some of them might be biased, sure. But they don't espouse viewpoints that I find to be disgusting and ignorant, so what are you gonna do?	20
0	A CDC whistleblower has now confirmed it's being covered up, the CDC's own data shows that vaccines are causing Autism	20
0	This is ludicrous that Big Pharma have convinced people to worry about mild short-term illnesses, vaccines are causing lifelong autoimmunity and disability, there is no comparison, unless they can clean up vaccines and make them an honest science then there is no vaccine with a beneficial risk/benefit ratio.	20
0	Global warming isn't science. It's watermelon politics. Green on the outside and red on the inside.	20
0	Then you're likely around 13 years of age and are completely out of depth on this topic.  Come back to this post in 8 years time and see if you have the patience to attempt to read the studies.	20
0	I agreed until you started talking about what I presume is a "living wage".	20
0	No, conservatives recognize that it's complete and utter bullshit to scare people into not polluting. We would rather just ask people to stop polluting or to pollute less than use scare tactics..	20
0	The sensible solution is the market based one - a carbon tax. This would effectively account for the externalities of greenhouse gas production, while allowing people a free choice.	20
0	But it never has at the RATE it is now.	20
0	I just hate liberals.	20
0	Of course we weren't. However, humans are on this planet in our current form and will likely have difficulty adjusting so rapidly to a very different living condition.	20
0	Much like the dinosaurs did?	20
0	So we agreed the temp has changed before? Even without man on earth to cause it?	20
0	What does him being a comedian have anything to do with it? You can be a comedian and be very politically opinionated and express those opinions via your comedic platform regularly.  Just because he uses humor to convey his points doesn't mean he shouldn't be looked at as a pundit. I find Greg Gutfeld hilarious, but that doesn't mean he should get a free pass from criticism.	20
0	Actually I hate the "science" of it too. Climate "scientists" have been predicting catastrophic climate change for the last several decades. According to many past predictions of people such as Al Gore and the IPCC (UN climate panel), our ice caps should be long gone by now. All predictions of catastrophe have been wrong. So why does anybody listen to them anymore?	20
0	&gt; to scare people into ~~not polluting~~ **raising taxes on businesses**  FTFY.	20
0	So what's the cost-benefit? Is there any evidence that climate change will result in real costs that are greater than that of preventing (or abating) it?	20
0	Except that the rate of change now is **less** than it has been in the past 8,000 yrs. The standard deviation of the temperature over the last 8,000 years was 0.98 ± 0.27°C which is higher than the 0.85°C the world has warmed over the last century.  http://multi-science.atypon.com/doi/abs/10.1260/0958-305X.26.3.417	20
0	Again,  irrelevant comparison, we're not talking about msnbc, they are also trash.  How can you not see the hypocrisy in complaining about msnbc pushing an agenda? Fox is arguably the most guilty of them all of this.	20
0	Remember in the 70's when they said that in the 2000's we'd have no more food due to climate change?	20
0	There really is no lower rung or bottom of the barrel for libs. "Hate speech" my ass, these people get offended if you look at them crosseyed.  I think there should be an IQ test to qualify for voting privileges. How's that for some hateful speech?	20
0	although they well may be the greatest, am I an asshole for being annoyed we're so commonly using a liberal's book title to aim focus on these fallen?	20
0	Then what is your problem? Someone is always pushing an agenda, why don't you liberals get over it? It's human nature to try and further your wants and desires, are you telling me to keep my mouth shut? If you are, stick it up yours cause last time I checked, this is America, land of the free, where the constitution allows for political freedom, if that's your only problem you don't have an argument, because your arguing against free speech, and I will not tolerate you trying to take my right away or Fox's right away.  If you want a controlled media go to Russia...	20
0	Then you should get over msnbc pushing an agenda also.  I'm not telling you to keep your mouth shut.  You can have your opinion all you want,  as Fox can have theirs.  Doesn't make the opinion correct though.     It's always fun arguing this,  then I remember the average Fox viewers age is somewhere around 68 years old.  Younger generation knows a little better...	20
0	I'd love to hear the reasoning for your downvoting, it seems I am contributing to discussion. Is it just because you disagree with what I am saying?	20
0	Have you heard of the Belgian operations in the Congo? Where more people were worked to death than died in the Holocaust? http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/18/congo.andrewosborn .   &gt;The "sin" of colonialism includes spreading Western medicine, infrastructure, and standards of living to parts of the world that would otherwise still be using spears and teepees  This was just a byproduct of the massive resource extraction perpetuated during colonial times. The institutions of these nations were also destroyed by this oft forceful colonization, which arguably is one of the reasons for lingering instability in Africa today.	20
0	So how is wage calculated with zero as the minimum.  Do we score by work done per hour, or by amount of money made for the company?	20
0	Almost everyone with a wage above minimum would be unaffected by a drop in the minimum wage. They are paid closer to their market value.	20
0	So a worker's market value isn't enough to live off of?	20
0	This explains it pretty well: https://youtu.be/4j01L69eXdI	20
0	Find another employer.  It's what I'm doing now. My employer is paying me below market. I got a raise recently and it was still below market. They claim they did their research, so I'll be doing mine by applying to somewhere else that can meet what I believe I can demand in the market place.   I have no obligation to my employer to stick around when there are openings in my area that I qualify.  They have no obligation to keep me as well. It is in their interest to keep me at my salary to not have to hire someone at a higher rate and lose out on profits.	20
0	Then pull up your sleeves and take that job. What is better?  No income or some?  Save up and always look for the next step. Even if that step is moving elsewhere. Never settle. And never believe any job is beneath you.  You are always in control of your life. It just depends how hard you want to work to get out of your undesirable situation.	20
0	Most immigrants today,legal and especially illegal dont even give 2 shits about today.They are just here for the fruits.	20
0	What you did not mention was that we should continue to invest and promote tradational enegry sources. While reneable is nice, the cost does not justify the means. Coal is proven just because liberal groups want it gone, we should not give in.  Funding should go to promoting clean coal, better mining techniques etc. Funding should go to internal combustion engines at levels greater than electric engines. The president ought to allow (really sickening that it's just one person who can do it) more refineries in this country   In summary do not believe that the only source of clean energy comes from bs liberal groups.   Last but not least nuclear.	20
0	Whats the alternative?  So don't be employed then and make $0?  I don't see why being unemployed is even more desirable.  If you land a job, take it, and do what you can.  Stop being a victim.   Or find a way to offer your services.	20
0	IT'S A FUCKING OPINION. And the democratic opinion has been shown to not work, go look at the inner cities. I'm pretty sure the farmers in the Dakotas, the people of Texas and the state of Michigan have turned around, all under political control, while Baltimore sits in ruins, chicago is filled with corruption and california is bankrupting it's citizens.	20
0	Fair enough, thanks for the correction.	20
0	Let's just keep ranting about things I didn't mention.  Yet to see anyone defend Fox as a great source of news and opinion,  it's always "msnbc and them damn Democrats and liberals suck", not "Fox is great because this this and this".	20
0	While working you can gain skills to move up within the company. If it doesn't provide more skills you can acquire them by getting training. You can also demonstrate that the efficiency you develop over time justifies a higher wage. You can also find supplemental employment.	20
0	It's impossible to have an argument with you, you ignore what I say and stick true to the hive - minded thoughts that is /r/politics	20
0	explain how Im not telling the truth.Instead of just silently downvoting.	20
0	"Wars can be avoided if we simply embrace our enemies."  -every damn liberal	20
0	Blah blah blah blah fallacy fallacy fallacy leftist dogma leftist dogma leftist dogma disregard for history and reality x3 + a dash of cognitive dissonance	20
0	Lower term limits on welfare, let the free market decide the living wage. People won't work at a certain wage, they'll look at other ways to make money like starting their own business.	20
0	Yup, there's a war all right. Tanks and nukes and everything. Just like there's a full fledged war on Christmas.	20
0	I find it disturbing that we are even having this discussion.   This is fact not opinion.	20
0	The bit about a someone coming in and doing another employee's job for less money, that is the exact problem we are facing with illegal immigration.  Employees must be paid at least minimum wage, illegal aliens on the other hand, being undocumented workers can be hired in at below minimum wage values, pricing American citizens out of certain jobs.  Increasing minimum wage will only shut down small businesses as well as price Americans out of the job market.	20
0	Wow, and here I thought there were more than 2 burger joints in most cities	20
0	If you're in an area where there is one employer and he is only willing to pay $0.25 an hour, get the hell out of there.	20
0	Find the data from BLS or NBER than. Don't link to numbers from a *project* whose motto is "On issues such as raising the minimum wage, enforcing worker protections, eliminating unfair employment barriers, and improving support for the jobless".	20
0	I saw a twenty something girl go up to a group of veterans and shake each of their hands while giving them a donation to families of those whose dad had died.  I was moved enough to pay for her groceries with the help of the Stop And Shop manager.  And yeah I also left a sizable donation, as I always do, to their cause.	20
0	Uhh, ok. Can maybe we not see that again?  That would be nice.	20
0	I don't approve but this is hilarious liberal brigader b8.	20
0	The people should be able to choose. That is the entire point of a democracy.	20
0	Get rid of welfare too.  Boom.	20
0	Why? I thought Cruz promoted liberty. A single person shouldn't be able to choose if there will be a poll on a subject. It would be interesting to see how every-day Australians feel about same-sex marriage. I think Abbott is afraid that like many countries, legalizing gay marriage is becoming more acceptable (hello Ireland). It should be up to the people.	20
0	I really wish they taught economics in school. Its all about Supply and Demand, and any price floor or price ceiling causes dead weight loss, in this case lost jobs.	20
0	Can I ask what makes Anglo culture and christian values superior to anything? Diversify is code for "re-intergration", not less white people. I think people are generally bitching about white people moving and changing everything, not really giving assimilation a chance. What would be your suggestion to help heal this "racial divide" like a good christian ought to?	20
0	How is this even remotely close to being Jim Crow? The very simple fact that a part of the group is dictating the narrative and has the power to make it into actual law kinda defeats your point. Do you even think racism exists? It's not really former power when it permeates through every facet of society. White on white discrimination is the more appropriate term.	20
0	You know that whats been happening to minorities for years, that's why the made the law in the first place. Are you saying the minorities have zero grievance, that discriminatory and predatory practices have not been focused on people who generally have less access to capital and influence with which to fight back?   Implied and explicit are not the same thing, there isn't a sign that says "white people only", that's not what anyone wants. If a public institution has only white people in it, is that because they had zero qualified minorties candidates?? BTW, racial quoats for public universities is illegal.	20
0	&gt;Just like the people who were against interracial marriages  Nice libtard talking point. Thank you, once again, for repeating the bullshit the media told you to believe. It's not like we haven't heard it before.  &gt;The government shouldn't be able to swoop in and tell a grown person who they sleep with  Fucking idiotic. Sexual relationships are not being legislated.  &gt;who they can form legal relationships with.  Actually, the government has that right, that's kind of the definition of "legal".	20
0	&gt;Capitalism always works.  Except in the case of civil rights laws, equal housing laws, etc.	20
0	I'm kinda liberal and don't hate white people. Hell, *I am* white.	20
0	You realize that lobbying against abortion because of your religious beliefs is forcing that on someone else. No one is asking you to move to minority neighborhoods for the sake of fairness or to think twice about bringing your culture. Its when people come in, use their political connections to force people from the homes, then bringing businesses in from outside the community and don't hire a single person in the community. This also leads to landlords not leasing to certain people for "fear of property values going down".    By your own phrasing, removing someones culture through legal means is no different than saying either act like a white christian american or get out.	20
0	Not a question, but a statement. He said you can't force people to accept and live in another culture in the name of social fairness. Gentrifying, kicking people out illegally and not hiring any of the people who live their is exactly that.   I'd rather take opinions from an editorial written in last 100 years, seems a bit more relevant to today's issues	20
0	Who cares? If a man wants to marry another man, why should the government interfere? Likewise, if a state votes overwhelmingly against it there, leave them alone. Liberty. It's not a new idea, people.	20
0	What's wrong with same-sex marriage?	20
0	Lots of books about income inequality, imperialism and CIA/JFK conspiracies.  Shocking.	20
0	Saying that is a choice is like imprisoning someone and telling them that they can choose the color of their cell. It's thinly-veiled control.	20
0	Where do you live? in my area they sure dont show it.	20
0	Well it's usually viewed as one of the issues inherent with a democracy. The idea that if left unchecked a majority could use the government to make life difficult for a minority. It's a bit questionable if the majority should define everything. We've seen this happen in the past and it took much longer to reverse decisions. Nowadays though our judicial system is very quick to put a stop to questionable laws. This'll come up in any situation where people are left to decide what rights/new rights others should have or shouldn't have.	20
0	Why?  Because you don't like that far left political thought makes good bedfellows with al-Qaeda?	20
0	Wow. Lol. They make the Left look totally depraved.	20
0	Based on **models** of future warming.	20
0	It's going to be a sad day for comedians when they are all gone.	20
0	And NASA has become a highly politicized agency especially under Obama. Nevertheless they say one thing, and these other guys say something completely different. I thought the science was settled.	20
0	Jebus says it's evil and the gays will indoctrinate children. Marriage is sacred and you're compromising the sanctity of an establishment that should be reserved for things like the bachelor and married at first sight. Children need to grow up in a home with a mom and a dad, because divorce didn't happen (see sanctity of marriage). Also gays are icky.  None of these are my personal beliefs, but I've heard the arguments used before	20
0	The left and AlQueda agree, that Western imperialism and white people are the problem.   The fact that Chomsky and OBL are on the same team is what bothers you leftists, which is why your diatribe is so off the rails.	20
0	&gt; Also: "Why can't I upset the public? They upset me." That's fucking hilarious. I wish more comedians said that instead of apologizing for being offensive.  McGowan is not a comedian.	20
0	&gt; And, of course, they will deny History, which is probably even worse.  Meh.  History is written by the victors.  There was so much crap we were fed in school growing up that is either filtered at best, or flat out wrong at worst.	20
0	OK I take that back if you are not. (There seems to be a big wave of lefties posting in here lately.)  I responded that way because your obvious anger does not seem very conservative on this particular topic. It sounds like you think Islamophobia is a real problem, just like the left does.  There is no denying the left and the Islamists have the same goal, taking down the West and white people.	20
0	Actually, no he's not. He used to be, until he looked in depth at the evidence and changed his mind, just as a scientist should.	20
0	The downvotes on here are hilarious.  Why does it upset people to hear that Noam Chomsky et al. are anti-American and thus give al-Qaeda the kind of political and philosophical ammo they need while waging propaganda war against the United States?	20
0	Precisely.  Chomsky acts as a "useful idiot" to al-Qaeda.	20
0	Good advice from Thomas Sowell.  See also: Proverbs 22:6  &gt;Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.  Parents need to inculcate a strong sense of proper morality in their children, from a young age, and thus inoculate them against the various moral diseases spread by the Left.	20
0	The shock is caused by presuming that since we like democracy, everyone should.  Just because we prefer rampant sexuality outside of marriage, doesn't mean everyone does.  Just because we believe that men and women should be equals in the family unit doesn't mean everyone does.  Other societies and cultures should live under the system that they prefer.  If it's a dictatorial islamic state run by what we consider stone age thinking, who are we to judge.	20
0	We should aim higher.  "Climate Change" is about 15th on the list as to why Obama is unfit to be President.	20
0	&gt; We should aim higher.  Who is 'we' and who appointed you their spokesperson?	20
0	Barack!  Nice to see you posting here!	20
0	No, it's not "the thing to do" in any case except a very few crazy anomalies.  I suggest your adjust your news source if this type of "story" seems common to you.  There exists, Microcosms of news, that have no backing. You are being seduced by them, most likely because you love to hate, but I can't be sure because i don't know you that well.  Your post history speaks volumes.      &gt;Do not financially reward bad choices. Sterilization of both offending participants. A media blitz shaming those dumb and selfish enough to have kids that they can't support on their own.  Ugly stuff	20
0	Old enough to come stand up against baseless hate. At what age will you stop thriving on hate for others?  I mean really, I'm trying to come see your side. I want to be a conservative. I used to be.  But every time i enter the conservative realm and hear what there is to be said, i can't help but notice the facts are always presented in a manipulative way,  or everything is just based on hatred.  Statistics often don't make sense out of context.	20
0	I encourage anyone to research Irving Kristol's (Bill's father) Trotskyite origins as well as the rest of his neoconservative ilk. These neocons are reds dressed up as conservatives.	20
0	So why does the DoD, NSA, and other intelligence agencies support it? Generally if a program is a failure the agencies involved will state that they want to get rid of it (though if congress doesn't agree they have no choice).  Does the Patriot act make it easier for them to do their jobs? Why do these organizations support it?	20
0	Well, what do you think the point of the show was? I hope you don't think it was just an educational show for children? of course it's not obvious to realize the kind of parasite he is now when he was doing his show back then.  Along with everything else influencing our generations over the decades, this was yet another to add to the list.	20
0	Is it truly not commonplace? I guess i feel maybe like it is.  Perhaps I need to reconsider.	20
0	&gt;Oh, and by the way, go to hell. Popularity is not an argument.  That's democracy though. If the majority feel inclined, they make it so. Would you rather live under a dictatorship where preserving the English language supersedes human happiness?	20
0	Your entire premise is predicated on the faulty assessment that there is a maximum amount of money. This defies everything about economics.	20
0	How can study after study determine how much of the wealth is held by a certain population if the number is not finite? And if not finite, why not print more and give it out?	20

0	&gt; Edit: Downvotes? For explaining the mindset of one side. Only in r/Conservative  Explaining anything in here, right or left, subjects you to scrutiny.  Best to close your eyes and keep jerking.	20
0	There's no irony. Jim Crow affected people economically, legislatively, physically - criticism of overly wealthy white people domineering areas where other people are living so *they* can start vanity projects is not discrimination. It's the protection of other citizens' right to life, liberty, and the pursuit. Gentrification is dangerous to people without great wealth. It's not the hallmark of a democratic society.	20
0	&gt; The point is that the left doesn’t kowtow to Islam because they actually love Islam, but rather because they hate our own culture.  Consider all the things liberals are for and against.  In every case their position is to tear down the country and the system of capitalism.  Though it's never going to happen, it would be glorious to succeed several states to them and let them start their own sovereign country.	20
0	A yearly 100 dollar fee would be enough to stop you from buying an electric car?	20
0	What's wrong with electric cars?	20
0	I would guess not. If it is truly unconstitutional as he believes, then the programs should be abolished regardless. I think this is more of a play to pro-security people; "Hey it's ineffective and it's unconstitutional". It's the same argument anti-capital punishment people make "You aren't saving any money by killing them, so you might as well keep them alive in prison".	20
0	Can't you do better than personal insults	20
0	Ah, moving to where you want is not democratic!  I forgot!  Better stay in my government zoned white person camp!	20
0	Forcing the current residents out by price is not just "moving to where you want" - it's a hostile takeover that damages peoples' livelihoods.	20
0	Because they're (predominately) not white and don't like America/Israel.  That's literally the one reason.	20
0	"Anti-choice" fucking lol.	20
0	&gt; Maybe if you spent more time discussing the facts and less trying to incorrectly pin things on people you'd have something interesting to say.  I didn't incorrectly pin anything on anyone, actually. And I gave you facts. But you ignored them, calling them inapplicable, then bringing up a tangential conversation which is somehow more applicable than mine. You then ignored the critiques leveled below regarding your sweeping statements above.   It's pretty clear logic doesn't work for you. That's fine. Good luck to you, friend.	20
0	When does life begin? We can't be exactly sure, so let's just say at birth and it's okay to kill an 8.75 month fetus because it's just a mass of tissue.  Hands Up Don't Shoot was shown to be patently false and yet the narrative continues, you know because it could've happened that way.	20
0	If you have unhindered access to the actual email server (which she did) you can indeed permanently delete data so that it is unrecoverable.  Most of her staff have probably deleted any copies they have as well.  It will however be interesting to see if any 'personal' emails turn up that can be provided by people outside of her administration that she conveniently did not release.	20
0	Conservatives = The sensible quiet kid who goes on to be successful.	20
0	The Democratic National Republic of Illinois.	20
0	The main reason the libs push for "feel good" agendas like min wage hikes is because to the "average" voter it sounds Ike a good idea. It's low hanging fruit they can easily pick to garner votes from an otherwise simple minded voter. A good portion of Americans don't understand complex economic models so democratic politicians prey on those people.   It's actually a good strategy in our current environment where our education levels are seriously lagging among developed nations.	20
0	Because they're not Christians.	20
0	The Democratic Republic of California.	20
0	It makes no sense though. Why would I hate white people? All of my political views tend to be in self-interest, I want to improve my life. So it's nonsense to think id be anti-white as a white person.	20
0	Canada's a joke. Next.	20
0	True, and that's exactly why I promoted economics as my son's major in college.  I knew he'd be smothered in liberal BS and propaganda, I hoped an understanding of econ would shine a light on reality.  It worked.	20

0	Tyranny of the majority is a natural side-effect of democracy; however, the majority have to cooperate with the Constitution. If the majority is so great, they'll eventually elect officials to alter the Constitution.  I think you'd probably be happier with living in Saudi Arabia.	20
0	I just don't think Rand can win a general election or even a Republican primary being so weak on foreign policy.	20
0	Me too. I literally have no problem with them at all. But the militant actions I see so often make me recoil and despise.	20
0	Don't worry, Sanders supporters are here to stem the tide	20
0	His stance on foreign policy is to not have one. I'd say that constitutes being weak on foreign policy.	20
0	She is unbelievably obtuse.  She ignores ANY facts that discount what she says, and makes up her own.  Impressive.	20
0	Most women know that anybody is better than a conservative when it comes to these issues.  Everyone on this list knows it too.   You can all just say women are stupid but that would just reinforce how women feel about you.   I'm ok with the down votes, but you "guys" clearly have a problem with the vast majority of women.  It's not a liberal problem, it's a conservative one.  The polls all agree on this, even your own.	20

There is a sentiment of non-acceptance which is pretty clear from the fact that actual politicians can say gays should have less rights than straight people without losing 90% of their potential votes.	20

0	You chose not to address my post.  Your right to do so.   It still won't change how women generally perceive conservatives will it.	20
0	You did not address my post, but just repeated talking points.  How will this improve women's perceptions of the conservative movement?  BTW, I'm not a Hillary fan either!	20
0	Don't understand why you were being downvoted. Wonder if it was by Hillary supporting liberals?	20
0	ACTUAL Christians understand that men wrote the bible and thus the bible was never meant to be followed. All men are flawed, therefore man was never meant to follow man. The bible is guide beset before us, nothing more. Ignorant people always use these as "facts as to what a "true" Christian is. Not every Christian is an extremist or bible literalist.	20
0	Yeah the petition seems really weak. At the least  Brad, the petition originator, should have provided links and some description in the petition for why Bernie needs to read an economics book. Seems real lazy. I'd support otherwise.	20
0	From what I read in the article, I hope the appeals process can clear her name.  Even if she was otherwise a completely worthless Marine and they were looking for anything to discharge her, the powers that be made a poor choice of tact.	20
0	Feel free to say whatever you want about the left, or me.   Just don't discuss with your peers the absolute fact that a majority of women don't view conservatives  as friendly to them.    It's not my problem, it's yours.    It literally does not matter what you say about or too me.  What matters is women's perceptions, right or wrong.	20
0	Feel free to vote however you want.  The crock you complain about is actually a perception issue women have about your movement.   What is the rights plan to fix this.  Claiming women are just wrong will not work.	20
0	Hopefully you're right, but with the number of Christian proprietors being hammered with fines and lawsuits for having the audacity to adhere to the doctrines of their faith, I'd say it's a 50/50 toss up right now.	20
0	It's not a serious petition. Do you really think that if there's enough signatures Bernie will think "hmm, I guess I better sit down and read a book since it's what the people want."?	20
0	This has nothing to do with my comment, especially when taken in the context of the comment I responded to.	20
0	Yeah, vote for Sanders because he openly wants to take over half your paycheck and give it to people who don't work.	20
0	Seriously? You're trying too hard. I'll direct you again to the parent comment.	20
0	&gt;Similarly, Christians . . .  Hey guys, just so you know, refusing to provide goods or services to an event that runs counter to your deeply held religious beliefs (not to mention, over two thousand years of history) is "similar" (to the point of sameness) to murdering people who refuse to convert to your deeply held religious beliefs.  Ergo, it is perfectly reasonable and good for the Left to coerce you into renouncing those beliefs, or else to go out of business.	20
0	Like I give a shit about the opinion of a drug addict?	20
0	Ahh so you do take it deep for the a-team.. okay okay..	20
0	That dude just looks unstable.	20
0	Naturally, the petition creator couldn't give an example of the fallacies in Bernie's logic.  But don't let that stop you guys, bandwagons are the BEST!	20
0	It is if the person you are intending to ransack has a say in the matter. Sanders isn't veiling his intentions in rhetoric for the sake of winning votes; he's being completely upfront about them. We don't have to vote for him, but if people do, they will know exactly what they are getting.	20
0	You know what I say is true, I don't need to repeat all the polls.  You don't want to discuss it, and I can understand why.  Good luck with that!	20

0	Correct, I have thought this and said this many times before.  Only thing is gays do not have centuries of shit done to them.  They have been a underground aspect of life for a long time.  So despicable shit done to them for centuries, no, but the rest I agree with you on.	20

0	I like how you guys just spew fox talking points like facts. You really think all dems just want a hand out? Don't you realize most of the people the tech industry, professors, music and movie industry, graphic design, etc are democrats. I myself would for a large software company and make a very good living. We work hard and want better lives just like you. So mindless attacks like that don't help anybody.	20

0	With all the social media which exists, such as reddit, Twitter and others.  They can easily say something, if they continue to say nothing at all.  This will not end.	20
0	Yep life isn't fair.  Some people are smarter or harder workers than other people and make more money.  Why is it that a person who makes more money should  be forced to pay more for the same public services?  Also, I have yet to hear anyone suggest a 30% flat tax.  Thats ridiculous.  More common is 15%.  And if you make $20,000 a year that $3,000 in taxes (federal), yes there is state or sales tax blah blah blah, we are talking about the federal rate.  I don't find this unreasonable.  I suppose it is even a better incentive to work hard and become rich.	20
0	You say this as if "gay marriage" is the say all, end all hot topic that will decide a politicians fate. I find the irony damn near palpable because our current president was actually against gay marriage when he got elected in 2008....................and when he was re-elected in 2012. He's flip-flopped more on gay marriage than Jiminy cricket in a jump house.	20
0	Obviously 30% was just an example. The point is that the more money you have, the more each dollar is worth (to you). People better off pay more because *they can afford to* and we, as a society, decided that its worth having people better off help out those with less. I understand that it may not necessarily seem "fair" but its really a matter of morality vs. fairness.	20
0	Liberal here infiltrating your cute sub. I am self-made with a six-figure job, left my home for college at 18, and religiously watch The Daily Show. I'm sure this will do nothing to change your view of The Daily Show or it's viewers, but I can't resist bursting your smug bubble.	20
0	&gt; The shock is the realization that a widely approved President would be seen as very radical by today's standards.  Source?	20
0	With respect, that is the usually excuse. The problem was that Romney was the better choice last election. A successful businessman vs a crooked lawyer. The left kept pushing out lies ( though it was ok because hey we got to get Obama elected) to hurt him. He wasn't perfect but he would have done a better job. I just don't  know why he slacked off in the debates.	20
0	Hateful crimes don't discriminate.  And actual politicians can discriminate along [racial lines](http://www.wnd.com/2009/01/87223/) without losing their political support.    So your special interest group deserves more protection than Christians?	20
0	You and Sanders don't appear to understand how wealth is created and thus why the answer is "irrelevant."	20

0	Seriously...."let me count the ways..."	20
0	It's great that the party has so many good candidates but let's face it, many of them are not electable come Nov 2016. Time to start squeezing out the weaker players to get behind one or two who can win.   I'm thinking Ted Cruz. Smart, fearless, true conservative and Hispanic who could tip Florida, New Mexico and Arizona.	20
0	&gt; mass graves, degradation of civil liberties, and collapsed economies   None of these things are necessarily properties of socialism. I was referring to the fact that "socialism" became a taboo word.	20

0	Likewise, who has a VAT? Everyone, except for us.	20
0	Yeah that's ridiculous. You'd think both major parties would love it since it's a.) efficient and b.) hurts the upper, political donor class proportionately less.  Edit: looks like my next reply has been deleted. I suppose that's fair enough given the sub.	20

0	Just playing devils advocate: what if, in south park terms, it really is a giant douche vs a turd sandwich? Do you not vote?	20
0	You vote independent. Regardless of what the media shows there are far more than 2 candidates.	20
0	Ok, fair, but don't you agree that sometimes it's going to be the least of all evils? You may not agree with what any candidate says, but if you don't vote, that's just as bad, right? And what do you say to people who think they're throwing their vote away by voting for a third party candidate? Honestly, I don't mean to be antagonistic, I'm just curious about your point of view.	20
0	The closest thing to a "progressive" Republican are the religious right.  They are the most socially conservative, but the most economically liberal.  Tea Party would generally fill the same niche as "hard-line", with a bit of bleedover from the libertarian faction.	20
0	What's wrong with what Scandinavian countries are doing at the moment? That's socialism, and they're not killing people.   Socialist shouldn't still be a scary word unless you have a manichean world view where anyone who isn't conservative is evil; which makes you somewhat of a ditz   Just because someone identifies with a broad characteristic, doesn't make them literally Joseph Stalin	20
0	Nothing will change if people believe they are wasting their vote by voting for a candidate they believe in. The validity of a vote is not determined by the winner. Its a similar idea to working to save the environment. Its not so we can enjoy jt, but so our children can. Things aren't going to change overnight. You will vote for a lot of losing candidates, but if people start voting for who they believe in eventually we will not be in a 2 party system that is by nature corrupt, combative and inefficient	20
0	Because a percentage is stated as of the moment of the data it is calculated.  Giving it out is precisely what has been being done with QE.  Those dollars have done nothing for those in need as I am sure you will agree.  Welfare, which is what you are advocating, in fact enslaves and provides the ability to say "I give up," "I'm OK living at the minimum. I'll vote for you, just let me eat."  That is inherently abhorrent.	20
0	Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone.	20
0	Proof that the indoctrination in colleges and the media are effective in warping young minds into a leftist agenda. Mao and Stalin alone are responsible for the murder of 100 million people. But Bush is worse because he believed in faulty intelligence and magically caused the housing bubble collapse.	20
0	Not yet. .223 Australian Outback. BTI and its practically a frag round.	20
0	Yep, chemical weapons in control of crazies, psh they were just from x time ago, doesnt matter. move along.	20
0	Did you even read, it's a 3 paragraph article?  &gt;The Clinton global charity has received between $50,000 and $100,000 from soccer’s governing body and has partnered with the Fédération Internationale de Football Association on several occasions, according to donor listings on the foundation’s website.	20
0	Okay, I guess in this context Bernie would be an advocate for adopting Scandanavian-esque socialism.    To me, trying to implement something that has shown results in other countries is positive, especially when it's clear that the US is is dire need of something new	20
0	As far as Libya goes, we had to get ghadaffi out of there. It's post ghadaffi mismanagement in Libya that led to the rise in ISIS. Also I could be wrong but if we helped the FSA, ISIS wouldn't had risen in The Levitine. I do like Rand Paul but I think him thinking that the US could sit out every conflict is naive.	20
0	Why Canada? The Caribbean is where me and my friends have decided to flee to.	20
0	How old are you, just curious?	20
0	Alright what form of gov is not corrupt? Let me know and get back to me.	20
0	&gt; Problem is life isn't fair and we are not equal. This is inherent in a free society.  This is one concept of freedom, [negative liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_liberty). There is another form of freedom, [positive liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_liberty) in which individuals are free because they possess the economic mobility necessary to be free.	20
0	I would not call &gt;500k hyper rich...	20

0	Got to admit, the more I hear from Carly, the more I like her. No wonder they want her off stage.	20
0	You do realize that the one liberal panelist is there to provide a strawman to beat up on. I mean this is Fox News we're talking about here; hell it's one of many biased media outlets, the fact that it's conservative is just incidental to this method's ingenuity as a propaganda tool.	20
0	yeah, well, that's just like your opinion man.	20
0	Berrick Obama: The 13 most reassuring words in the English language, "I'm the government and I am here to watch over you and listen."	20

0	Dems NEVER admit defeat.  Hussein has some other path in mind	20
0	She won't be for long.  I see Bernie Sanders passing her up after he gets his ball rolling.	20
0	Liberal: A catch-all term for people who commit the exact same irrational offenses as me, but happen to fall on the other side of an issue.	20
0	Not really.  I am still in contact with a lot of my political contacts after last year's races (I helped run Stewart Mill's campaign in the MN-08 district).  All of their internal polling and analysis show that he will shift above Hilary within 6 months.	20
0	Save it for the general election.  The photo is not a liability in a Dem. primary.  If anything, it convinces the radicals that she's not *really* the moderate (for a lib) she appears to be.	20
0	I will wait for it to be in a library then.	20
0	No Rand, the hawks did not create ISIS.   Straight out of the left's talking points there Rand. ISLAM is the problem, not us.	20
0	It's ok logic in our current political system where everyone says things but you have no idea what they might actually do. Like Obama.	20
0	Please, please be right. Oh, please. Talk about comedy gold.	20
0	So essentially you agree with me? I feel crazy thinking I'm the only person who doesn't really mind. I hear the "well if they come into your house to search it's okay because you don't have anything to hide" comparison but it's hardly the same.	20
0	Wtf? Isn't Coke owned by the Mormons?	20
0	I don't see this as a negative. He's looking out for his state, which he should. That doesn't mean that he should or will get the assistance, but I expect representatives of my state to care more about my state than others	20
0	I disagree.  Part of being an elected senator is finding the middle ground.  What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Either you support all states getting equal protection under the law per the Fourteenth Amendment which includes appropriating emergency funds from the federal budget, or you enact legislation so your state has its own emergency fund.  To attempt to deny other states the funds they need in times of crisis only to cry wolf in your own hardships is dishonest allocation of federal dollars at best.	20
0	What's not cool? Forcing women to have unnecessary procedure...   Like an abortion, boxer?	20
0	That might have played in the general election.  It's suicide in the primaries.  We can close the book on Rand Paul's candidacy.  The only question now is whether he'll run as an independent and split republican votes.  He could have qualified the statement more;  he could have said that our actions had unintended consequences and that we needed to be far more careful when deciding to intervene.  That would have been the smarter play, I think.  Oh well.  Good luck walking this one back, Rand.	20

0	Alls that would have to be done is add an amendment to the bill exempting rape and incest cases??? But wait rape is an "act of God" the outrage is the fact that it doesn't address rape and incest not all this other bullshit that's mentioned in the article	20
0	I saw this on CBS news last night.  Just kidding.	20
0	I quoted it in text, but:  &gt;Hispanics seem as a whole to be totally opposed to most conservative positions.  Obviously not, if 40+% of them voted for a conservative in Texas.   Edit:   If you read the rest of the ABC article, it expands on the fact that Latinos hold more conservative social views than the rest of the country, and their conclusion was that social conservatives (like Latinos) would see increasing shifting of parties.	20
0	I guess, like you said, we disagree on what a sellout would be to the Republican party. But that doesn't change the fact that Hispanics can be receptive to conservative ideals.  I would also encourage you to research the implications of issuing work permits to illegals. They would never be able to vote, but it would naturalize their status and give us federal taxes from 12+ million people.	20
0	At least this play makes sense from a marketing standpoint, because surely it's only a short leap to get these people obsessed with "Coke". Maybe they could run ads with people touching their bottles together. "Nothing says 'I love you' like a Coke in your mouth!" Definitely an un-tapped market.	20
0	He's trying to pass it off as a lame attempt at satire.	20
0	You have zero data to back up your bullshit. Postwar economies have a history of growth. You didn't really want to come here and lay out that argument did you?  http://economics.about.com/od/useconomichistory/a/post_war.htm	20

0	There's no "being the better person" in politics.  If you want to win fights sometimes you have to kick people in the nuts.  Unfortunate but true	20
0	It's not that they chose them so to speak, more developed them. Politics have always been nastry, but starting around the 60's, the dems evolved into a method simar to that of an entitled 15 year old who thinks they know everything, is incapable of differentiating opinions and being told no.  Thuthus, we see caddy remarks and temper tantrums as a common response. Now, Republicans are starting to act the same way.	20
0	I'm more of a Pepsi guy anyway.	20
0	You didn't build that!	20
0	No, they really really don't. They lobby public officers to reduce their obligations, hide money offshore, and delay payments, starving the public utilities of funds, which helps the privatization drive.	20

0	You don't have to read about if you don't like it, why even bother to comment you're so high above it all?	20
0	Because I believe focusing on things like this instead of on the actual merits of these people as leaders is anathema to democracy.	20
0	I would be (I am) mad too, but mad at the right people.	20
0	I'm so happy Colbert and Stewart are gonna be off the air (if they're not already? I don't watch). Those college liberals will have no idea where to get their opinions from.	20
0	This is why elected prosecutors are such an awful idea. You get these incompetent loons because they say what the cameras want to hear.	20
0	Shame that mudslinging articles like this are written about this man, he's never run a negative campaign ad in his 30+ year career	20
0	I have read a good number of stats that show the length of monogamous homosexual relationships to be considerably less than heterosexual ones.   I wonder if this will continue to be the case with same sex marriage, because if this is true, there may be even more kids in the foster care system than there is now.  I mean if a same sex couple (with children) splits, surely the burden of responsibility would only fall on the biological parent anyway?	20
0	19 fucking 72???  Put the other guy down, so we look better...?  Brilliant!  Sad :(	20
0	~~He would have a fabulous lawn.~~ You make a good point. Many liberals *talk* about giving to the poor. But what they really mean is you have plenty of money and you should just give most of it away	20
0	This is why "Conservative" is not taken seriously.  Ok, this is one of **MANY** reasons.   Ann Coutler's face on the sidebar is another. Seriously?	20
0	So what you're saying is that Reagan OPPRESSED the USSR into collapse? I can get behind that kind of shitlording	20
0	that's the point, no one here cares about what he wrote.	20
0	No Rand, Kamikaze Islam created ISIS, try again Ron, uh, Rand...	20
0	&gt; After Islam was founded, Muhammad wanted to prevent people worshiping him in pictures/paintings and to focus worship on God. It's as simple as that. Muhammad wanted all the focus to be on God rather than a man.  Even if this is the real reason, he failed miserably. IMV, almost all the focus *is* on Muhammad. OTOH, one could easily imagine why a guy with an illustrious bloodthirsty history would wear a mask during the head lopping.	20
0	The premise of the original study was that canvassers are manipulating the data to incorrectly show lots of support for gay marriage by having homosexual canvassers.  This would imply that all the studies showing widespread support for gay marriage might have been misleading.  The fact the original author of that study has ADMITTED to lying and that other scientists couldn't replicate many aspects of the study show it to be bunk.  This would seem to bolster the idea that USA is moving towards gay marriage acceptance, or at the very least some data that would seem to contradict that has been proven to be a lie.	20
0	Wow....what a slimeball.	20
0	Rand, Rand, Rand......why do you always *embarrass* yourself like this?	20
0	It's almost like he thinks that the weapons will go away after their use... they don't.. they get bought, sold, etc and make their ways to the opposition we were against from the beginning.	20
0	Nice straw man, but I did not encourage similar articles. It is important that people see how context works.   Then again your comment is a good example of out-of-context reactions.	20
0	What?  Not even close.  Equal protection laws say nothing about sexual orientation, only sex.  And it's obvious heterosexuals get benefits from the government if they choose to marry.  That doesn't mean anything.  You're missing my point by miles.  I'm saying that if the only argument in favor of redefining marriage is that it makes gays happy, that is a stupid argument and shouldn't be listened to (first because it isn't true and second because it's irrelevant).	20
0	Right, the [Fedayeen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedayeen_Saddam).  But of course, the current narrative is Saddam had no ties to terrorism, whatsoever, so hurrdurr Bushlied.	20
0	The only thing we should pull form this is that Michael Lacour shouldn't be entrusted to do political science polls. If his methodology can't be trusted, then toss it out.	20

0	And the right has no shame either.  We done here?	20
0	Hes right, but for the wrong reasons. -ONE- group of people finds it offensive, mostly because they are told it's offensive, but without understanding what they are being offended over.   The actual definition of "the n word" is an ignorant person.	20
0	The only time Bernie's name gets mentioned in this article is in the title.	20
0	You really have no clue what you're talking about, do you?	20
0	I think Islam is the perfect religion for 7th century barbarians. You can take as many wives as you want, abuse them all you want, and decapitate infidels who refuse to convert.  Of course they don't worship their "Prophet", he was a brutal bloodthirsty barbarian, the farthest thing from Christ on Earth. *That's* the real reason his image can't be reproduced.  I'd love to see someone like Clint Eastwood make a movie about the true story of the barbarian's life, of course that can't happen because, well we all know Kamikaze Islam can't handle the truth. The myth is so much better.	20
0	Cool, but he still said that, so no reason not to discuss it.	20
0	But I still make more money. You'd have to be an idiot to just say fuck it in life because your raise is 20k instead of 30k.	20
0	.....thank you for proving my point.   "This should stay at the top" actually discourages further articles since they would reduce the placing of the article.   That's basic redditing.	20
0	Wasn't this reported MONTHS ago? What in the hell is up with all these new 'revelations' concerning Obama scandals?	20
0	It was reported from the beginning that Bergdahl left a note indicating that he was deserting. A Pentagon investigation concluded Bergdahl was a deserter in 2010.   Here's a CNN story one year old reporting that Bergdahl's fellow soldiers were forced to sign non-disclosure agreements:  http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/01/us/bergdahl-deserter-or-hero/  I'm sure I can find an older one.	20

0	&gt; Germans came here in greater numbers yet never had "press 2 for German".  They had their equivalent to that. Just look at the history of German language newspapers in the US or the history of heavily German populated areas of the US.  Their where whole town where German was the main language used.  It even was this way up to as resent as the 1960 in some areas of Wisconsin and I believe there is still 7 German language newspapers published in Wisconsin.	20

0	This "investors" site is a bunch of Zionists posing as American conservatives. The Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, and al Q are not at all the same. None of them like Israel, but only one of them has attacked the USA. Zionists make out they're the same thing to get Americans to fight for them.	20
0	Which wouldn't be beneficial to illegals since right leaning policy attempts to force illegals out. I understand the rhetoric of your hypothetical, but if conservatives dragged their feet with closing the boarders for illegal votes, they really wouldn't be conservative anymore.	20
0	Um, Churchill mouth breather.	20
0	Still waiting for the Hillary indictment.	20
0	Defense is a Constitutional mandate of the Federal government. Going Ron Paul on national security is not being conservative and no the majority of Americans will not support it. It's a losing proposition.	20
0	Looks like he averaged 1% gdp growth throughout his presidency. That stimulus pay off to his democratic buddies really paid off. How the hell did he get reelected?	20
0	He probably believed in traditional marriage. Such people are obviously threats to the state.	20
0	&gt; The second thing is modernization on social issues. I really only mean gay marriage and transgender protection  If you stand for nothing, you'll fall for anything. If the Republican Party is just "Democrat Lite" and supports the far-left social narrative as you want them to, there will no longer be any real distinction between the parties as they are similar enough economically. Look at Europe, it is a cavalcade of left-wing parties and centre-left parties which were once conservative and Europe, especially western Europe, is not generally on an upward projection.	20
0	Yep, call in the nation guard, army, marines, navy, superman, batman, spider-man, avengers and anyone else we have a code red national security risk.	20
0	"... believes that illegal immigrants should be allowed to vote ***if they can prove they live in this country and pay taxes***."	20
0	Here are 2 ideas:  1.) Just plain do better with those who don't typically vote Republican.  2.) If you can't beat them. Leave them. Conservatives should move in mass to a single state. Maybe Texas for example. Then secede from the US and create a Conservative nation.	20
0	And no one will force you to keep your gun.	20
0	Hasn't stopped people from making children. I think gun owners can adapt.	20
0	Uh, why? People don't like guns or the inevitable stigma of violence that surrounds them. It's not a political issue, it's a "people having access to killing devices is kinda scary" thing. Yeah yeah, there are some liberal whack jobs about the issue, but the bigger picture is that guns and crime are inevitably linked and some people, falsely, think removing guns reduces gun violence.	20
0	I had one instantly become the apologist for Sanders with this one. He said it didn't matter because it was 40 years ago. I reminded him of the Romney "hair cutting" that was 40 years ago and he deflected with "I'd rather vote for someone who said something stupid than someone who bullies."   So sexist 40 years ago is ok, but "assault by hair cutting" isn't.	20
0	Sexist views can change a lot over 40 years. The entire prison system is built around bullies rarely changing their ways.	20

0	&gt; I didn't see that in the article after reading it a third time, where was this sentence?  I'm pretty sure you didn't actually open the link.  The first twelve paragraphs are an editor's "mea culpa" for running this bullshit story in the first place.  That sentence is in the ninth paragraph from the top.  This "marine" is an ass clown.	20

1	That's cool you love Jesus. So do I.	24
1	Awesome. We both love Jesus !!	24
1	Did Jesus use grape juice?	24
1	Jesus came to give life. Not take it away. Anyone who is pro life for unborn babies but pro death penalty misses the point about the forgiveness of sin and the redemptive power of His grace.	24
1	My friend has schizophrenia (just like this poor fellow), is medicated and lives a very full life, we run, play basketball and go to church. He is one of the most caring people I know and you would just throw his life away because of his disease?	24
1	Jesus only used Welch's premium 100% grape juice. He had it flown in from the US, along with ice to keep it from going bad.	24
1	Can't argue that, though it doesn't legitimize LU	24
1	ME TOO!!!!! Live!! Love!!!	24
1	Christ is my Lord, my God, my friend, my King, my Savior.  I love him with all of my heart and I'm blessed to know him as my personal savior.  No man on this earth comparable and what an example he set to live life by, how to love, how to grow.  Whenever I read through Christs time here through the gospels I'm always inspired by the way he lived and the choices he made.  Still one of my favorite passages is Mark 11:22 "Have faith in God" Jesus answered.  What an example Christ set for us, I love him!	24
1	That's nothing. When I first got saved when I was 15, I was so on fire that when my friend was punched by a bully, I rebuked the bully in the name of Jesus, just like I thought the apostle Paul would, expecting him to fall out, which he didn't. He was really confused, though, and then left us alone from then on. I really think he was scared of me from that moment on, thinking I was either crazy or a witch.	24
1	I'd like two double McCommunions, and a side of Free will Fries, please.	24
1	I'm sorry, we only serve Will in Bondage Fries here at The One True Church^^^TM.	24
1	I'm sorry to hear that. I will gladly pray for your father and you. Peace and love.	24
1	Lord have mercy. I'll pray for both of you. May Our Heavenly Father grant you peace as you go through this.	24
1	I love Jesus. I am flawed, imperfect, broken, and disabled. Only Jesus can fix me. Without Jesus I would not be alive and living today, he saved my life.	24
1	Is it weird that I'm not a Christian but love Jesus?  That's why I come here.	24
1	What do you love about Jesus?	24
1	His love for his enemies.  His compassion for the sick,  the outcasts.  His emphasis on taking care of the poor.	24
1	Nope, not at all. Many people look up to Jesus due to the examples of compassion, understanding, and love set by him. You may not have the same perception of him as other people but that does not mean that you cannot learn from the example that he set.	24
1	I'm praying for you, friend. We are here for you. You are never alone. Don't forget that.	24
1	The official video game of the Orthodox Church is still Doom, and it must be played on i486 PCs with CRTs of 800x600 resolution.	24
1	This will go well.	24
1	Better question: do you believe that anyone (barring Jesus) *isn't* a sinner?	24
1	I can already feel the boundless love!	24
1	$20 says yes, because even heterosexual people are sinners.	24
1	Everyone is a sinner.  Edit: So as not to be accused of being too literal, I don't believe that someone is a sinner because they are &lt;whatever acronym you care to use&gt;. I do believe that people who are having gay sex are sinning.	24
1	^  The atheist gets it.	24
1	It was tongue-in-cheek. I was pointing out how ridiculous the question is, since it's pretty clearly not going to bring about any good discussion.	24
1	I just want to be pedantic and ask everyone who answers no "but isn't everyone a sinner?"	24
1	Only three people said it in the first thirty seconds. Must be a slow night.	24
1	So you believe posting the word "no" contributed more to the topic than my post?	24
1	Why do you think homosexuality is sinful? Other than murder and hatred, which are proven to be bad things, why seemingly innocent homosexuality? Do you have any other answer than "God said so." ? Do you think two adult gay people having a relationship leads to any harm?	24
1	And that's how my daughter accidentally took communion in a R. Catholic Church.	24
1	Did she catch on fire?	24
1	Not yet, but I keep an extinguisher by her door just in case. She does mumble stuff in Latin in her sleep though, not sure if that's related or not.	24
1	I'd agree. Chastity is not having extramarital sex. I think abstaining from sex outside of marriage would be in line with the teaching of Christ.	24
1	You replied to a bot. I'm sure it appreciates the attention but I doubt it is programmed to reply. Poor thing.	24
1	Amen. Its beautiful you can see this. God bless you	24
1	Last summer I attended an event from my old church that featured [DJ Hiz Glory.](http://djhizglory.tumblr.com/) His genre seemed pretty EDM. It's not a scene I follow though, sorry.   I'm trying to imagine it though. "God so loved the world, world, world, world, worldworldworldworldworldworld^worldworldworldworld *DROP THE BASS* wub wub wub"...	24
1	Hi guys and gals! I don't post here very often but I read the threads as often as I can. I love random posts like this because I get to hear from people and their love for Jesus. I was born a Muslim and was saved at 17, it's had taken me 12 years to learn just a little bit of how much Jesus loves me and therefore how much I love Him. I love reading the other sides of what people have to say and it thoroughly has impacted how I see His love for new everyday.	24
1	Best. Answer. Ever.	24
1	In the Orthodox Church, crossing your arms means you *want* communion.  After the Great Schism, the Catholic Church used this to identify the Orthodox in order to deny them communion.  Maybe I'm making up this second part.	24
1	A friend of mine brought me to a youth group party, one thing led to another and then I went and saw Passion of Christ when it came out in theaters. I was intrigued by the love Jesus offered on the cross for us so freely and willingly. How can you say no to that? I am now heavily active in women's ministries. I also am helping start a church where I live!	24
1	I agree with the LCMS position that scripture is infallible and innerrant. This position is spoken about [here](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=i&amp;word=INSPIRATION.DOCTRINEOF), particularly in sections 2 and 7.	24
1	The point being, the priest is about to give a blessing to the whole congregation - no need to individualize it by going forward to receive a blessing. But I still think it's a nice practice.	24
1	Biblical inerrancy, as far as I can tell, is literally impossible.	24
1	Praying for strength, peace and health for your father, you and your family	24
1	If you need someone to talk to, I'd love to talk to you. I recently (meaning not even a month ago) went through something very similar. I wish you father the best and that he becomes well. I'm sure I speak for everyone in this thread when I say we love you and wish you well.	24
1	Please, please do not down vote an Islamic user offering prayer here. Come on, this sub is better than that.  Edit: Thank you for fixing that.	24
1	&gt; Maybe I'm making up this second part.  ಠ_ಠ	24
1	You mean "When" Jesus returns :D	24
1	It's beautiful he can see this? It's the main message of Jesus, it's the main thing to see! I wish more of us Christians saw it.	24
1	"But you, come on again, all of you, and I shall not find a wise man among you."	24
1	No, I believe it completely. You can see empathy in animals like apes and other animals and last I checked they didn't worship any supernatural being.	24
1	You're reading the statement entirely wrong if you think it's a condemnation of religion. It's a condemnation of people who claim all atheists are inherently immoral or amoral.	24
1	It's true. It is a lack of empathy if you can't tell the difference between right and wrong	24
1	You're going to struggle to understand if your perception of the world is through Christian eyes.  I don't need the Bible to tell me to respect my neighbour or indeed not to murder or be adulterous. To me these are innate facts in our biology. How would you explain for example the rise of great civilisations which never had the Bible? I'm thinking Chinese, Indian, aztecs, etc.   Or would you write of their thousands of years of history and perhaps a new crusade should be raised into those lands for their lack of acceptance of your moral code. Although Christianity has quite a hand in South America now.	24
1	Mostly my upbringing and family influence. My upbringing was guided by scripture though, so yeah.	24
1	Always remember, regardless of your stance on evolution or creationism, that God made the Platypus. [Now come the part where we throw our heads back and laugh. Ready?](https://youtu.be/nxXEPk3dzFg)	24
1	For the weekend, friends are coming in to join us at the Maryland Sheep and Wool festival on Sunday. Then, Avengers: Age of Ultron. Then, Star Wars D&amp;D.	24
1	&gt;the Maryland Sheep and Wool festival   [applies for a booth to sell fine linen goods]  [trolldances away]	24
1	Anyone who can think up a platypus obviously has a sense of humor.	24
1	Want millennials in the pews? Be kind.	24
1	What's the deal with sermon series? Why can't we just follow a lectionary like normal people?	24
1	All my posts have a minus score. You like Jesus, you don't love Him.  Jesus replied, **"Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching.** My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.	24
1	Given how strict these requirements are, once every 70 years is shockingly high.  Especially the whole "no unanimous verdict" thing.	24
1	My niece has her first communion tomorrow!	24
1	The point of this saying is wrapped up nicely in this quote from Eddie Griffin:  &gt; *Nobody ever had to tell you it's wrong to kill your mama. Somehow you born innately knowin that.*  So we as Christians can believe that morals come *from* God and given to man, but man doesn't have to have religion to have morality.  Man does not have to give God credit for them.  There are things you *know* are wrong even if you don't belong to a religious group.    The statement is to point out the absurdity of some religious folks who think that you have to be religious to have good morals.	24
1	Honestly, I can't related to the "millennials don't come to church" thing because our church is full of them.  Preach a faith that actually changes people and a religion that has power.	24
1	Latin Mass chapels seem to do a good job at bringing in millennials. Perhaps traditionalism could do the rest of Christendom some good.	24
1	And don't kick them out unless absolutely necessary.	24
1	FYI: for anyone scared of Sharia, we basically have the same rules as Mosaic law.	24
1	I see myself in a similar place to Rachel, leaving my Evangelical megachurch for an uncool Episcopal church. One of the challenges I believe the church will have to face is the downside of modern consumer capitalism. It's tough for a church that lives in that realm to speak prophetically against it.	24
1	If that's the case, then why do that states that have Sharia as their law also have such high numbers of executions per capita?   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_of_sharia_law_by_country  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_capital_punishment_by_country  For reference:   Iran: 1663 executions from 2007-2012 (374 per 100 million) Saudi Arabia: 434 (260 per 100 million)   This is in comparison to Israel, which has had two executions total in it's history. I'm not personally opposed to the death penalty by any means, but claiming that sharia is the same as talmudic law in regards to executions and the death penalty seems a bit silly.	24
1	I feel like it's an insult to my generation that so many churches think we're leaving due to a lack of presentation and not a lack of content.	24
1	I really think the Episcopal church is poised to become the new "cool" denomination.  We have a traditional service and a progressive mindset.	24
1	When I was in high school most of my friends weren't Christians. Most of my Christian friends were nominal Christians. I never liked the one-upmanship either and felt more comfortable around non-Christians.  I never connected with Christians I felt comfortable around until I was an adult... and even then there aren't that many of them compared to all the people I know.	24
1	As with most ideologies, they differ between theory and practice.  Christianity is about love but [it has been used to support violence or hatred](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_violence).  &gt;I'm not personally opposed to the death penalty by any means, but claiming that sharia is the same as talmudic law in regards to executions and the death penalty seems a bit silly.  Well, this is what the texts say. If you think text is silly, that is fair enough.  EDIT: Also, Iran's situation was literally directly caused by the US's CIA and Saudi Arabia is legitimized by the US.	24
1	Because just like these Jewish precepts, this is the "idealized" form of the way it's supposed to work, but evidence suggests that the Talmud is often... optimistic... about how things will be carried out in real life.	24
1	In England, America and my country Canada, the Anglican church is on the verge of extinction.  Obviously Rachel Evans is wrong, a progressive mindset will not translate into Church growth, it does the opposite  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11340590/Church-of-England-cannot-carry-on-as-it-is-unless-decline-urgently-reversed-Welby-and-Sentamu.html  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/anglican-church-facing-the-threat-of-extinction/article4352186/  http://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2014/10/the-church-vanishes-part-deux/	24
1	I get them largely from what gets upvoted on Reddit.	24
1	Well, it did say a "bloodthirsty" court, so I would take that to mean at the highest. I'm sure the average number of years for a "normal" court would be much higher.	24
1	Fundamentally, you need to do two things:  1. Make the faith matter.  We know you can be good without God.  How does God make us better than good?   2. Provide meaningful connection, not just to the community present, but to the community not present.	24
1	&gt; a progressive mindset will not translate into Church growth, it does the opposite  That is only indirectly true. The decline in mainline churches has a lot more to do with demographics (less procreation) than it does particularly progressive theology. This is especially evident by the fact that mainline numbers have started to level off while conservative churches numbers have begun approaching the mainlines'.	24
1	"Hey! Don't do that! I'll have to throw rocks at you til you're dead!" - The Jews, probably	24
1	RHE has a habit of committing what is known as the "typical mind fallacy." Whenever she says "millenials," you should really read "me" instead.	24
1	Anytime a church tries to be hip and trendy, I cringe. Millennials aren't as shallow as a lot of churches think. And to think so is ageist. I'd say we like beauty and simplicity over rock music and free giveaways. It makes the church seem less like a place of worship and more like a promotional venue at a college campus. Also, having a pastor or a church that young people will connect to is important. Less fire and brimstone, more love and compassion.	24
1	So does Graham Ledger.	24
1	My biology doesn't tell me that at all. My biology tells me that my best chance for successful progeny is to love and respect one woman as the mother of my children. I'm not remotely alone in this. Indeed, I'd call it the norm, by a large margin.	24
1	I often attend a parish that offers the Mass in the Extraordinary Form (i.e. the pre-Vatican II Mass) and over 50% of the congregation are people under the age of 50. The more traditional, more orthodox parishes are the ones that grow. The more traditional, more orthodox religious orders are the ones growing. When the Church becomes wed to the spirit of the age, she becomes irrelevant.	24
1	How much do you think theology and church attendance are linked, though? I'm inclined to believe that we should focus on doctrine that's correct over doctrine that grows churches.	24
1	Reading this was the most understood I've felt in awhile.	24
1	I'm not sure it's an incorrect view of the law; I agree with you that the mob mentality had taken over. I don't think we're supposed to view the killing of Stephen as an act of justice, and Jews wouldn't have, either.	24
1	I love eating. I am also lazy. As a result, I am tubby.	24
1	I have absolutely no belief in God or any supernatural consequences but I treat people right because I have empathy and I desire to make people enjoy their time on Earth since that is all there is and all there ever will be in my belief. Even more reason to treat people right and leave something good behind for subsequent generations.	24
1	he's not looking to be offended, he is offended, and should be.  that comment was AT BEST condescending to an entire race of people, but actually shows a complete lack of understanding of the situation minorities in this country face. especially when it comes to those in poor neighborhoods and the police.   also, it's apparently ok, and an acceptable response to riot... as long as it's not done in the United States.   http://gawker.com/remember-when-donald-rumsfeld-stood-up-for-rioting-and-1701493122	24
1	Or how the Jewish legal system never let it happen but the Romans did.	24
1	Sometimes people have had bad experiences with things, and they harbor a lot of anger and resentment towards that stuff. That's pretty normal.	24
1	Many atheists have had bad experiences of religion personally and in society. If you sat down with an LGBT person in one of the southern US states, or in eastern Europe, Africa, or Russia, I think you'd perhaps understand that yes, we'd like that sort of laissez faire attitude, but it's not what Christians actually practice as a whole. (Edit: Which is to say, it's not usually about radicals. It's about how more than half of the voting population thinks.) Bad things are done and it is _often_ blamed on the faith, by its own practitioners.	24
1	If you are talking about places like r/atheism you have to understand that a lot have people have been harmed by religion and it is a place to vent.  Other then that people can be dicks, religious or not. just ignore them.  Also, Not that it really matters but Hitler was not an atheist and atheism is not a religion.	24
1	All I can say is that I severely disagree with your idea of justice.	24
1	Dude, this is my internal struggle.   I am, I guess, what amounts to a/the "worship leader" (I trace the "J" as a friend once told me) in a tiny rural non-denom church in SC and we just took that step towards having those weird pre-made videos with sweeping helicopter shots of landscapes and crappy WoW/Hilsong music tracks passing for the singing and the more I listen to them the more saccharine and superficial they sound.   Maybe I'm just old and too precious with my 2 hymns some 80's praise choruses and out type services.	24
1	Coupled with the anonymity of the internet it is a perfect vehicle.  That's why I don't try to judge /r/atheism too harshly.  There are some people there who've received poor treatment.	24
1	Can confirm. My parish (exclusively EF) has more people in their 20s and 30s than any other parish I've ever been to.	24
1	So when the Anglican Church goes extinct in the UK, do we get all of our churches back? :-)	24
1	[I'm old enough to get that...](http://i.imgur.com/tLM7Erv.gifv)	24
1	I would want them to be punished with accordance to the law of the land, which I would want to be one that prevents future harm as well as hopefully dissuading people from taking such violent actions to begin with. Taking into account that we might not always get the right people, and doing violence ourselves as retaliation isn't healthy for us, the justice I'd want is jail with some sort of rehabilitation to change that person for the better, as seen in many Nordic countries.	24
1	Amen to this. We're not looking for "cool". We're looking for authenticity. And by the way, authenticity isn't something you can manufacture and market. In fact if you're manufacturing and marketing your church's style, environment, or anything else you're probably not actually authentic at all.	24
1	I think this is it for me too. I like rock music, but I like tradition as well. I didn't leave the church because you didn't play the right kind of music, I left because the message seemed to be filled with judgment and hell, rather than love, tolerance and compassion. I understand that God said there were consequences, but I also know you can have similar messages but a different tone and attitude and it comes across differently. Also, action based churches, I want to go out and do.	24
1	Because so many religious people hate on atheists.  We judge them, we tell them that they are going to hell, without even getting to know them we tell them that they are sinners, etc.    Further, it is no more hard for an atheist to open their hearts to others than it is for Christians.  But there seem to be no lack of Christians who do not seem capable of opening their hearts either.	24
1	It's almost an insult to God. It seems to imply that the Gospel *needs* to be repackaged and 'made relevant'.	24
1	The damage the Internet has done to religion is lasting and irreparable.  Besides, do you really want to go to church with people who are only in it for the iPad/car/whatever?	24
1	Who made RHE queen of millenials unhappy with Evangelicism? I didn't vote for her...	24
1	2: the whole Bethlehem story (with the insane census, the logistics of which make **no** sense) feels like a plot device deliberately invented (yes, I said it) to put Jesus in a place to fulfil exactly this  8: except... since Jesus isn't actually Joseph's son, this does not apply  9: those aren't things that have actually happened; they have just echoed scripture  11: whenever I hear "And so was fulfilled" etc, a little part of me says "warning; story may have been bent out of shape to accomplish this..."  ultimately, these are all pretty weak.	24
1	The logic makes sense though. Teens (including me) are fascinated by simple and entertaining things, no doubt about it. I like video games. I like netflix. I am also fully aware that these things have no long term benefits to me while going to church and being a Christian has infinite benefit. So why do I prefer netflix over reading my bible sometimes? Because it's more entertaining. So while you're right, I understand why older Christians believe that making church "more relevant" will help bring teens in.	24
1	[There's even a diagram](https://zwingliusredivivus.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/rhe2.jpg)	24
1	Want Millennials back in the pews? Stop trying to make church 'cool' using rock music, and start trying to make it cool by changing your doctrine in accordance with the latest zeitgeist. We want a church that challenges us and engages us in *precisely* the ways in which we *wish* to be challenged and engaged.	24
1	Just a Jew who understands what a prophecy is. :)  Are you born of a woman? Good job! You have fulfilled a messianic prophecy!	24
1	You're just simply wrong on both accounts, I don't have the time to deal with this type of thing. I'd just urge you to investigate deeper. And notice how your example is one story of an atheist who killed a few people with lots of variables sparking that dispute or a guy from decades ago that literally had nothing to do with atheists in this country.	24
1	Most people would rather be free instead  of locked in a heavily controlled environment. And I don't think violence is ok, thus proposing jail. Killing a murderer does not bring the dead back to life, the only thing left is to make the future better.	24
1	It's not an assumption. It's my experience.	24
1	My father burns in Hell and has for the last 15 years. Why would I want to come to a church that cheers his torment?	24
1	Thank you! I just did a rather large presentation last week on the effects of the Christian church in the way they view outsiders, in an almost Xenophobic way. My main point is approaching everyone with love. It seems so cliche, yet we fail on almost every basis. This is also why I am getting sick of this stigma against the "hip pastor" with a beard and tattoos. Who cares? Does he love God? Is he presenting the gospel? Then shut your generalizing mouth up. Church stereotypes are so absolutely annoying.	24
1	Vote for who you believe benefits people the most regardless of the peoples religion.	24
1	Every divorce I've seen has been a far cry from a private matter.	24
1	Ehhh 2/10.  Edit: Woops, updated flair, I don't post here often, just lurk.  I am also an atheist, as full disclosure. :P	24
1	Presumably, when you're receiving texts, emails, Facebook messages, etc., you're receiving them from people with whom you have a personal relationship. You're in the in-group with people you know.  That is not the case here - you're among strangers, and many of the people you're talking to are the people you're talking about.	24
1	Indeed. I much prefer traditional churches. They feel more... Reverent, and fascinating.  The hymns, the music, it feels like you're connecting with a two millennia-old legacy to a greater degree. But maybe this is just because I'm a history buff.	24
1	You're bouncing from topic to topic. My comment was about justice that we are doing here, since I'm an atheist. I don't think there is a hell or heaven.	24
1	&gt; Well, that is a huge discussion  That's precisely why you should shut the hell up about Hitler being an atheist.   If you agree there's a "huge discussion", you're obviously being dishonest when you write nonsense such as "Atheism (Hitler)".	24
1	This article would have been sweet like 20 years ago.  Now, it's like "well, duh".	24
1	I think there's a kernel of truth to what you are saying, but at the same time she tours and speaks all over the country in addition to having a pretty high-level of online interaction with her blog readers and twitter/facebook followers...I think she has her finger on the pulse of what those people are looking for.	24
1	My church has renamed Sunday School to "Total Chaos" in an attempt to seem fun and relevant to kids. It's the most cringeworthy nonsense I've ever seen, and I'm pretty sure the numbers have actually declined since they started doing it.	24
1	As /u/galtonwatson said, plus those verses are usually thrown about to *end* conversations with and about unbelievers, while this sub is primarily for the *encouragement* of discussion of Christianity with everybody, believer or no.	24
1	It may be a history buff thing, because I really like to drop in on the Orthodox and Catholics from time to time.  It's neat to think of the fact that I'm participating in a living tradition that dates back to the time of the Caesars.	24
1	&gt; more like a promotional venue at a college campus  Or a car lot.	24
1	&gt; It seems to imply that the Gospel needs to be repackaged and 'made relevant'.  Hasn't that happened many times already, though?	24
1	Sadly it is porn.  I'm way better than I was a few years ago, but have not been able to stop 100%.	24
1	The gofundme page directly contradicts the article in several places.  Their Facebook page has a couple strange arguments on it, e.g. it sounds like the new location would be handicap accessible, but they don't want to use that entrance because of visibility.  The tone of their posts also concerns me. They act like they don't really believe the church wants to use the location for offices.  TL;DR: I'm not convinced that the store is in the right here.	24
1	Yep. I finally became comfortable this past year at an Episcopalian church because of the liturgy and traditional nature of the service after getting fed up with the hollow feeling of the new-age churches described in the article.	24
1	Not very much.  My conservative atheist parents are still trying to figure out how they managed to raise two liberal Christian children =P	24
1	&gt;conservative atheist  Can..can those exist?	24
1	Exactly.  If someone is an atheist, Christianity won't suddenly be enticing if it has rock music.	24
1	Yes and no, and that's exactly why we have trouble accepting the word "traditional". The gospel itself has only been translated, not repackaged, for ages and ages. But we see traditions without basis in the gospel, and want *that* to change.	24
1	I can't tell you how many times I heard my former pastor say the following:  "The message cannot change.  How we present the message has to change."	24
1	The Gospel will always be dynamite.	24
1	Can confirm. Am Millennial. Love the Extraordinary Form of the Mass.  I also sing Gregorian Chant, especially Missa de Angelis-style Agnus Dei and Sanctus all the time.	24
1	&gt; I'm a real person who really would go back to church if it didn't preach more hate than love.  Churches that preach love really aren't hard to find.	24
1	I've done it before, but I don't recommend the flick to the random page technique.   There's a joke about it for a guy who did that method.  He flicked to a verse that said,"he went off and hanged himself." and then flicked to a verse that said,"You go, then, and do the same."  So be careful with the method of flicking around the bible for advice.  I'm not sure it is meant to be used like that.	24
1	This is very exciting, because they are all really, really good candidates for the position, which will be elected in this year's General Convention by the House of Bishops and ratified (or not, though that's never happened as far as I'm aware) by the House of Deputies (which represents the other orders of clergy and laity).  Edit: For what it's worth, I'm hoping for Ian Douglas because he would be very, very helpful at restoring some frayed bonds in the Anglican Communion but really, I don't have anything bad to say about anyone on the slate.	24
1	Go Bishop Curry!  He almost forcibly confirmed me!	24
1	As a history buff, I can totally agree with you there. I almost converted to Orthodoxy a couple years ago, had I not been married at the time, I might have gone through with it. My ex-wife didn't like anything traditional so it never happened.	24
1	And I'm pretty sure Jesus is going to come back before the dragons finally arrive.	24
1	When I was in NC a bunch of my friends were being confirmed into the Episcopal Church.  After the service, they dragged me up to Bishop Curry and told him that he should confirm me.  He looked at us very confused, and said hello.  But now that I think of it, Bishop Breidenthal is supposed to be at my friend's wedding in October.  I'm told the plan is to have me sit next to him, in hopes that he will convert me.  So now there's a 1 in 4 chance I could be sitting next to the Presiding Bishop.	24
1	I agree. The new trendy churches are exciting at first but always fall flat after you've realized they don't go much deeper than what you see. The established more traditional churches, like my parents, come off as intolerant and stagnant in a rapidly changing culture.   I'm a Christian, but many Christians wouldn't consider me to be one today, which is very telling on where our religion is headed.	24
1	With rock and roll, obviously.	24
1	You and I have different ideas of fun fact	24
1	You're not making Christianity any better, you're just making rock and roll worse!	24
1	It's all a conspiracy. When they realized they wouldn't defeat rock and roll with the Culture Wars, they took a more subtle approach to destroy the genre...	24
1	I tell ya hwhat.	24
1	So many young people, like myself, are heading home to Orthodoxy or Catholicism, usually with a brief stint on the Anglican stepping stone.   Christianity is such a rich, beautiful Tradition that has been watered down so much that there really isnt anything left other than bad music and extraordinarily long sermons.   To be fair, plenty of Orthodox and Catholics throughout the world leave the Church as young adults, too. Its not really fair to limit this to any one denomination or "style."	24
1	Yeah, and you could probably also read *Finnegan's Wake* four times  or more just going by word count, but would you really know what the hell was going on?	24
1	The hipsters do like retro stuff.	24
1	I think that's just making a problem where there isn't one. When we pray for peace, we pray for *true* peace, not just "make this thing stop."	24
1	For those who don't want to click through, the points are:   * Welcome immigrants   * Battle economic inequality   * A just economy means strong families   * Protect the environment   * Fight partisanship   * Promote dialogue, not ideology	24
1	Oh, hey, I just emailed Breidenthal like, a week ago. Weird. I don't know enough about them to say who I would like the most, but my major concerns are repairing our ties to the rest of the Communion and reversing the downward trend of Episcopal membership. Obviously those are tall asks, but I want someone who can at least put us on a path toward those goals.	24
1	Hitler, as I'm sure others have pointed out, was Christian. Catholic to be precise. Whether he sincerely believed or merely used Christianity as a vehicle for murder and destruction is debatable, but there is no point at which he professed a lack of belief in a deity.	24
1	Jesus will return before we will see the next book.	24
1	Well yeah, but it's one thing to apply it to modern issues and topics and another thing to throw around dated internet references and flashy laser light shows.	24
1	I lost a war with my books.	24
1	Why does everyone have to focus on the lgbt stuff? Focus on what this article is saying - that churches are just marketing corporations that seem insincere and irreverent, not to mention hypocritical. There's plenty of things around us like that, but the church shouldn't be.	24
1	Especially when it's terrible shallow rock music.	24
1	I was lost but then I found the laser light.	24
1	It depends on what you mean by *Christian* and *humanist*	24
1	I'm not a millennial, I'm an early X'er, but I just got so tired of what I call "The Church Show!" - put all the beautiful people up front in the worship band, powerpoints for everything, appeal to emotion. It's pretty much everywhere in the American church now.	24
1	Erasmus was pretty cool.	24
1	&gt; Are you too important to interact with them?  You are displaying a classic misinterpretation of introversion and social anxiety.	24
1	He's not allowed in Heaven. He got kicked out.	24
1	Going back to my original thesis, "No One Will Care How Right Your Theology Is If You're An Asshole".   And,  to be fair, I've been that guy too sometimes. The verse I keep in mind is 1 Corinthians 8:1: "Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."	24
1	Well, either leave due to lack of content or find churches with the content we seek, as far as I've seen. That and write articles like this one.	24
1	Yeah. That whole Catholic social teaching thing doesn't apply to America, because America is already perfect.	24
1	Do you say that to people who are suicidal too?	24
1	Oh, this is hilarious.	24
1	That made me chuckle. Though I'd like to know, hypothetically of course, if this priest would be excommunicated for breaking the seal of confession.	24
1	I'm fine with that. I just think it actually is a secondary issue.	24
1	It's what you get when you mix red and green.	24
1	I don't think he did since he didn't say who it was. The politician just got the short end of the stick :P	24
1	Conversely, I was told by more than a few people when I left Christianity that I left because the church (that none of the people who told me this had ever attended, for the record) lacked substance.  Funny, because I thought I knew my own reasoning, but apparently people 1,000 miles away know better than me, but that's neither here nor there.	24
1	I have no idea what my original point was sorry.	24
1	My sister's response to "we have to be relevant" is "relevant to who?"	24
1	For some reason Rob Ford was the politician I imagined.	24
1	Suddenly this seems less like a joke and more like something that maybe actually happened.	24
1	[He actually can't under any circumstances](http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/religion-and-philosophy/catholic-faith/the-seal-of-the-confessional.html)	24
1	No I was going to make a point about a rising of population of christians who committed crimes. Then I realized the crime was their faith. Fuck China	24
1	No. The priest acts as a "representative" for God and is not there to be the police, he's there to administer the sacrament.	24
1	You're an embarrassment.	24
1	Wuz lost, can has salvation?	24
1	It's literally the flesh and blood of Christ.	24
1	no its not for real, churches can do whatever they want in regards to gay services, they are not public institutions are are not bound by the same laws as businesses or government services, also I think the orignal source for that story is the National Review, which in case you don't know is only a step above stormfront as far as balanced reporting goes	24
1	No, under no circumstances may the seal of confession be broken. The church takes this very seriously.	24
1	Any article that intentionally uses Barack Obama's middle name can be dismissed out of hand.	24
1	Satan rebelled because he wanted to make himself equal to God.  Or, it's something about [teh ghey](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/03/21/church-warns-about-gays-remember-satan-was-first-to-demand-equal-rights/), or perhaps the uppity women, or those colored folk.	24
1	from wiki: approximately 54 million Christians in China in 2007  I can't find any estimates from 2014, but all the estimates leading up to that appear to be between 30 and 50 million (Pew seems to be an outlier at 68 million).   Whatever the numbers, this doesn't seem to be because of an exponential growth in Christianity since 2007, but increased persecution/enforcement as the article suggests.	24
1	It's basically equating LGBT with Satan, saying their demand for equal rights is the equivalent of Satan demanding powers equal to God. Which quickly false apart as a metaphor and seems rather blasphemous. As far as I know, it never happened in the bible. I know Satan tried to overthrow God.   Edit: I can imagine putting this sign in the perspective of the 1950s segregation.	24
1	&gt; the rejection of science  That's a big one for my kids	24
1	It just seems like desperation to play a card as silly as that.	24
1	Women, racial minorities, handicap, gender and sexual minorities, etc.   Everyone is getting compared to Satan.	24
1	&gt; while going to church and being a Christian has infinite benefit  my kids, 13 &amp; 15, wouldn't see any of that. They think it's all mythology, just like with the Greeks.  And I never talked to them about religion growing up, they came to that conclusion on their own through studying religion in school (even though their public school taught that the Jewish stories like Exodus were true in history class, they told me they were obviously myths).	24
1	I don't want to be God. I just want to file my taxes jointly, be on the same insurance policy, be sure that I can visit my spouse if he's ever in the hospital again, and obtain some other legal protections for my relationship.  Oh wait, no, I want to drink the blood of the saints and bathe the world in fire.	24
1	That flair-comment combo certainly is jarring.	24
1	If one is able to figure out who it was, but the person was not stated (and could not be really easily figured out), then it isn't automatic excommunication, but Father would be in *massive* trouble.  I'm talking "you might spend the rest of your life in a monastery" trouble.  Edit: To give you an idea.  The Curia can take ages to respond to most anything else, but when it deals with the Seal of Confession, you can expect a response in *days* instead of weeks.	24
1	CS Lewis did write [one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Screwtape_Letters). Dante Aligheri wrote a bigger [one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_%28Dante%29).	24
1	I'm with you for most of that, but saying that the same sex marriage isn't an actual theological issue is just wrong.  That's not presentation, that's what you think about parts of the Bible.	24
1	A case could be made that a person in that situation is, at least some of the time, not protected by the Seal.  The Seal applies to Confession, not the box.  When it does apply though, priests are supposed to die rather than break it (and they have).	24
1	Ill tell you what is. Its those damn kids and their loud rock and roll.	24
1	I disagree, it's beyond a terrible slogan. If you don't want to read it (conceptualize your faith) in the " America, 2015" context it's your choice. You'll be left behind. No pun intended.	24
1	It's the Jazz, Devil's music, that is.	24
1	Pandering to Hispanics? Catholic means universal. We're not Hispanics or whites or blacks or purple in the Church. The Pope espousing Church teachings is not pandering to Hispanics.	24
1	My wife and I were looking for a church when we were dating. We went to one near campus, after the rock music and lasers started up we were like nope... nope... nope...	24
1	The whole event with Israel's sons who murdered the city was on par with the red wedding	24
1	It's easy to say those people were not really Christians - in fact, [1 John 4:20] comes to mind - but *let's not pretend we can just wash our hands of it*.  People don't want to hear our excuses about how that's not "really" us.  The fact that they share (at least the word) Christianity with us means we stand some chance to influence them.  And we have to try - morally because people are being harmed, and evangelically because this kind of behavior craps all over our attempts to show people who Jesus actually is.	24
1	Pastors aren't tax exempt.	24
1	Especially compared to how good "good" church music can be.	24
1	It means "only political conservatives are really Christians".  And I know what *I* think of it...	24
1	The Gospel of Luke: It's Fresh!	24
1	Now what do you mean? Do you mean he wishes that the second Mormon is good, or that he is good whether he wants to be or not? Or that he feels good about that Mormon? Or that he is a Mormon to be good for?	24
1	&gt; If I'm reading Nietzsche or Feuerbach in school, my youth + young adult pastor would have had no idea how to respond.  Very well said. Youth groups in my experience don't do any good when young adults come across those positions that really do challenge their beliefs. Hence the widely-held opinion that Christianity is largely anti-intellectual and unquestioning.	24
1	&gt; Oh wait, no, I want to drink the blood of the saints and bathe the world in fire.  Get some floss. I hear that Judas and Brutus tend get stuck in the teeth.	24
1	It's been a thing for a long while. Age discrimination is very real, so much so that age is a protected class in United States law.   Of course, the protection applies to discriminating those above a certain age in hiring practices, but that's still ageism.	24
1	As a friend says, I hope Ms. Cook seeks help and forgiveness. At the same time, I feel like it is a stain on the church that it overlooked Ms. Cook's drinking troubles when it was in the process of figuring out who the suffragan bishop should be.	24
1	[Romans 1:26–27], [1 Corinthians 6:9–10], and [1 Timothy 1:9–10] all address homosexuality.	24
1	Most Christians (though not all) wouldn't describe most of what's in the Bible as the "direct word of God", but rather as the inspired word of God, which is a really subtle but crucial distinction.	24
1	The changes we make regarding theological issues should only come directly from Christ Himself (as they have, once the new covenant was presented). It is not our job to decide whether we enjoy this or whether it is modern enough for our sensibilities.  When you say presentation, I am thinking concretely of style of worship, what your church looks like, how your pastor/priest acts, etc.	24
1	Well not all denominations get to while away their days on "Party Island" AKA Mount Athos.	24
1	What a horrible situation. Hope for grace for everyone involved.	24
1	Since he referred to the sinners as sick and in need of a doctor, I would say the accepting them and converting them was all wrapped into one.	24
1	Jesus rose on a Sunday. Therefore, the Apostles started celebrating on Sundays. Therefore, the commandment about the Sabbath is typically treated as referring to the Lord's Day (Sunday) when seen in a Christian light.	24
1	I thought hard about things for months, and after a while I just realized I believed.	24
1	I know it sounds silly and unintellectual, but I feel like Jesus pursued me. Over the course of several months it was like I couldn't stop thinking about him and I kept being reminded of him by odd little things. Which was odd because I was a Wiccan and actually pretty hostile to Christians at the time. So I started learning and researching and undoing the damage years of stereotyping and strawmanning Christianity had done.  But to be perfectly blunt, my conversion was emotional before it was intellectual.	24
1	Avid athiest for a long while and had the strong urge to read the bible and give religion a try again. Read about half the bible so far and reading the scripture has definitely made me more of a believer. Like 85% ready to join the  lords flock of sheeple.	24
1	As someone with generalized anxiety and depression, I can honestly say that the only thing that helps is therapy and (with the advice of a doctor/psychiatrist) medication.  You are unwell and it is okay to seek help in getting well.	24
1	There are a couple of different views on this, but I tend to stick with the 6000 year estimate to only point to when Adam and Eve were around and when the first humans had God given souls and the breathe of life from God. There could have been other humans present at the same time and based off of the evidence we have it seems that this was surely the case since we have evidence of civilizations older than 6000 years.  ETA: A relevant AMA from /u/namer98 that you might like to look through: http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/260x1w/theology_ama_series_old_earth_creationism_oec/	24
1	&gt;had a powerpoint of dead celebrities who needed Jesus, including Chris Farley and K. Cobain.  That's a horrific thing. "Hey, these guys went to Hell. We know they did. Isn't it obvious?"   That speaks a great deal about the nature of those that ran that camp. I would've spoken to the guy after and chastised him for the error. That just makes me angry.	24
1	While Jesus may have hung out with sinners, he was not "accepting" of their sin.  They were still sinning.  He was there to show them the way *away* from sin.	24
1	Rahab, the prostitute from Judges, is an ancestor of Jesus. Probably not that obscure for most but I only learned about it in the past couple of years. In the genealogy of Luke only Rahab's husband, Salmon, is mentioned.	24
1	You are a very interesting, and sometimes confusing, person. I love it.	24
1	&gt; it is okay to seek help in getting well.  Such an important thing for people to hear. Thank you.	24
1	&gt;  In the genealogy of Luke only Rahab's husband, **Salmon,** is mentioned.  &gt; sounds fishy  Whoosh :P	24
1	Son of a...enjoy your whoosh, you got me good ;)	24
1	You mean from Joshua? That's where Rahab shows up (Jericho, specifically), not Judges. Rest of the fact is true, though. And super cool!	24
1	There's a very clever pun in [col 2:8 nrsv] - see to it that nobody takes you captive.  The word for "captive" here is a really rare word, so I understand: "συλαγωγῶν", or *sylagogon*.  Now the word for synagogue is "συναγωγήν", or *synagogon*.  So Col 2:8's "let no one take you captive" , "let no one drag you off", is really a clever way of saying "let no one en-synagogue you!" - let noone drag you to the synagogue!	24
1	So glad to hear, brother. Angels rejoice in heaven! [Luke 15:7]  Is there anything I can pray about for you?	24
1	I can just imagine St. Paul chuckling to himself as he wrote that.	24
1	Praise God for his persistence, mercy and grace.  Welcome back.	24
1	* Methuselah died the year of the flood.  * an ephah can hold 432 hen's eggs.  * When Saul stripped off all his clothes in 1 Samuel 19:24 and lay still on the ground all day and night, he was prophesying the manner of his death in 1 Samuel 31:8-9.  * the well-documented Roman method of crucifixion put a nail through the side of the foot behind the anklebone, causing the heel muscle to bruise (see Genesis 3:15)	24
1	The NT never says that Jesus changed Saul's name to Paul, which was what I was taught growing up. Rather, Saul was his Jewish name and Paul was his name as a Roman citizen.   I literally just learned this today. :)  Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle#names	24
1	Seriously. Sorry to anyone who likes it, but Christian Rock music usually sucks. But even being an atheist, I would go out of my way to listen to some traditional choral singing with beautiful organ or piano. It's truly a work of art.	24
1	Wow, we finally figured out what you have to do to get sanctioned by church discipline in the Episcopal church... Just be a literal murderer while ordained.  Now if only we could figure out what it takes in my denomination.	24
1	He did something similar in [2 Cor 4:8], the jars of clay passage. When he said *"perplexed but not in despair"* in the original Greek, what reads is *"apouromensis nil exapouromensis"*. The first term means to be at a loss of answers, while the second term is an exaggeration of the first, being at **such** a loss that you believe there can never be any answers. That's some wordplay there.	24
1	I grew up attending a Church of Christ and they take the whole not being a denomination thing pretty seriously. I understand where they're coming from but it's funny because they're pretty much a denomination.	24
1	Well, there was that one time when there were [*literally* Episcopagans.](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/nov/01/20041101-122457-1902r/?page=)	24
1	Methulselah means "his death shall bring."	24
1	Every time we take communion, with a tiny individual plastic cup of grape juice each of us can drink separately, I think, "Oh yeah, reeeeal communal, this communion.  We are such prissy Americans."  At least they haven't yet started distributing it as tiny prepackaged aseptic juice boxes with straws.	24
1	Hmm, I get why, but I wish us Catholics and Orthodox would allow it's members to attend each others services and partake in the Eucharist. I mean, I think our Eucharist and the Orthodox Eucharist are literally the flesh and blood of Christ and allowing such would be a huge sign of trying to work on our differences.	24
1	Why are there so many fascists?	24
1	God speaking to the snake: "I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel." Genesis 3:15  So Satan bruised Jesus' heel.	24
1	He told the apostles about it after the Resurrection.	24
1	They were created without sin, which means there was no separation between them and God. What that means is not something we are capable of understanding as it is entirely outside of our experience.	24
1	Religious, cut, against non-medical cutting of minors. It's a gross violation of bodily autonomy to perform an unnecessary cosmetic surgery/amputation without somebody's explicit consent.  However, once somebody reaches the age of consent I say let them do what they want. I can't say I really understand *why* somebody would opt for it, but I have no reason to interfere with what they do to their body.	24
1	I don't dislike those Christian T Shirts because there is something theologically wrong with them, I dislike then because they are horribly tacky and they only exist in order to be a "christian" alternative to secular t-shirts that are not objectionable in the first place.	24
1	Jesus and Satan. Jesus likely told the disciples of such events either during his ministry or after his resurrection.	24
1	Maybe it does need to be discovered if you converted into evangelicalism as a teenager.	24
1	I was a very strong atheist,   I realised there had to be a purpose in life other than just living.    God drew me to him.	24
1	&gt; God drew me to him.  This makes it sound like God picked you specifically, but ignored a bunch of other people.   If God can draw you to him, why doesn't he do the same to every single person on earth?	24
1	&gt;This makes it sound like God picked you specifically  I don't regard it as exclusive, the invitation of salvation is open to all.  I'm expressing what God did for me.    Why doesn't god do it for everyone? I believe everyone has the opportunity to respond to God, it s up to the individual to respond.	24
1	I don't think he actually called the Philokalia reductive. In the proceeding paragraph, he called an evangelical "test" reductive.	24
1	St. Thomas the Apostle. Doubts. Sees Jesus. Calls him God. Goes to India.	24
1	That is a great point that didn't occur to me; thanks!	24
1	I was a very strong atheist, I realised there had to be a purpose in life other than just living. Then I gave myself a purpose, and became a mega lustful super ultra anti-spiritual pagan atheist.	24
1	Sorry we don't have a flair for that. /s	24
1	I am very very very happy with this.	24
1	It's a miracle!  Awesome list. What does invited mean? They still have to accept?	24
1	Congratulations to our new mods.   Now get to work!	24
1	&gt; What does invited mean? They still have to accept?  That should just be a formality. AIUI the people above have volunteered as being moderators already.	24
1	I would say that both of these men stopped having faith. God didn't give up on them, they gave up on God.	24
1	All hail our new moderating overlords! Huzzah!	24
1	YES EMPRAGS! Finally some good solid  and honest Sidehugging affirming mods!   As the self appointed and only  moderator of sidehugs I can say you guys have picked a good hardworking mod	24
1	I don't get why drinking is considered evil and is essentially not allowed (Southern Baptist) I mean, Jesus drank! His first miracle was turning water into wine... after they had drank six barrels. Yet for some reason drinking is evil. If Jesus can do it, responsibly obviously, than we should be able to too. I hate when the Christian community tries to be holier than even Jesus himself!	24
1	Telling someone not to come back to Christianity in a thread celebrating a return to Christianity is not acceptable.	24
1	I don't think we could ask for a better group of folks. Thanks for bringing this process to fruition, and I thank our new mods for stepping up to the plate.   It is my hope and expectation that this subreddit will be an enjoyable community for discussion and discourse with the help of this welcomed influx of new moderators.  Thank you all.	24
1	/u/emprags is a mod now?  Well it was fun while it lasted.   Anybody got any ideas for a name for a new christianity subreddit that we can ban /u/emprags from?	24
1	Ave Imperator morituri te salutant	24
1	I as the self appointed moderator of /r/sidehugs have used my non existent power to ban him from /r/sidehugs.	24
1	Whats wrong with /u/emprags?	24
1	[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/b2WV7u0.gif)	24
1	Funny how the article says it has "outraged *conservative* Episcopalians". You don't really need to be Duck Dynasty material to raise eyebrows to this.	24
1	Paul is spinning in his grave	24
1	What isn't wrong with /u/emprags?	24
1	Thank you for standing up for what is right.	24
1	I believe 99% of people use it as a joke. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sidehugs/comments/2d93q2/who_are_the_false_redditors_in_your_opinion/) is the source of the joke.	24
1	Damn. Alot of people want to fuck /u/emprags.	24
1	Well, it would depend, I guess. If someone just out of nowhere on the street and said, "God's not real," I'd feel mostly confused. If it's someone I know, though, I usually feel a bit sad for the person, because they don't have the relationship to God that I do. I also get a little excited, because it's an open opportunity to talk about my faith, which I usually don't get in my day-to-day life.	24
1	It's a little inside joke, bro. /u/Emprags is cool....kinda....most of the time....well, sometimes.....err...	24
1	A mix of humor and pity. Humor because I've heard it a thousand times and this time certainly won't be the last. Pity because my faith in God and my relationship with Christ is one of the most fulfilling things in my life.	24
1	I don't know how to make it any clearer. You (or anyone else, for that matter) are not allowed to come into a thread on this sub for someone celebrating their return to the Christian faith and tell them to go away from it.	24
1	This thread has been linked to from another place on reddit.  - [/r/cabbagetrollfacts] [/u/cabbagetroll is now one of the greenest mods of /r/christianity](https://np.reddit.com/r/CabbagetrollFacts/comments/34mq0i/ucabbagetroll_is_now_one_of_the_greenest_mods_of/)  [](#footer)*^(If you follow any of the above links, respect the rules of reddit and don't vote.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger/wiki/) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose/?to=\/r\/TotesMessenger))*  [](#bot)	24
1	Well, I would say that I didn't create a relationship with God; it's the other way around. He softened my heart to Him, and I accepted the invitation to come into relationship with Him. If it helps, I didn't feel Him trying to communicate with me, either. Instead, I felt an overwhelming sensation that there was something profoundly wrong with the world and, more *shockingly*, that there was something profoundly wrong with me. I believe that conviction was the work of God.	24
1	Sometimes, I think the fact that I mean the Nicene creed when I say it, and don't feel bad about it being too 'exclusive',  makes me a conservative Episcopalian...	24
1	No no no you don't get it you see, that wine was actually grape juice according to my pastor. /s  I too go to a Baptist church, although I recently switched and now go to a less dogmatic one.	24

1	I thought for a moment that said "one of the *greatest* mods".    Then I realized that even /u/cabbagetroll isn't *that* much of a jerk.	24
1	Wait, even if it did, how's that *my* fault?!	24
1	Everything is your fault.  That comes with being a mod.   Prepare yourself for the inevitable "man, /r/Christianity really went downhill since cabbage was modded"  I'm sharpening my pitchfork already  /s	24

1	/u/emprags? Fuck that guy.	24
1	&gt;335 In her liturgy, the Church joins with the angels to adore the thrice-holy God. She invokes their assistance (in the funeral liturgy's In Paradisum deducant te angeli. . .["May the angels lead you into Paradise. . ."]). Moreover, in the "Cherubic Hymn" of the Byzantine Liturgy, she celebrates the memory of certain angels more particularly (St. Michael, St. Gabriel, St. Raphael, **and the guardian angels**).	24
1	I'm more worried about the panda agenda. Today we have a panda mod, tomorrow there will be panda flair, then panda banner, by the end of next week we'll all be pandas.	24
1	Do you have the "Big Book of Questions to Ask Christians" sitting next to you?	24
1	&gt;I've heard some people here say that it doesn't make sense or that its not true.  That's because it doesn't make sense and its not true.  &gt;what would the other theory be on the age of the earth and all the other creation stuff?  We have a good idea how planets form, as well as how old the Earth is (around 4.5 billion years).  If you'd like, you can read about how planets form here: http://hubblesite.org/hubble_discoveries/discovering_planets_beyond/how-do-planets-form. It's fascinating.	24
1	That totally doesn't read as creepy.	24
1	Is it frowned upon?  Of course not.    Is it a tad strange that you ask question after question after question with little follow up but even more questions, typically without providing your *own* opinion?  What do you think?	24
1	[Too late.](http://i.imgur.com/7drHiqr.gifv)	24
1	&gt;Thanks for bringing this process to fruition, and I thank our new mods for stepping up to the plate.  We actually have nine more mod candidates which haven't been excluded yet and which will be decided mostly by the mods in the bullet point from my OP.	24
1	My first thought was when did Harris start caring about intent in regards to moral calculus? *The Moral Landscape* was pretty much a huge ode to Consequentialism and billing it is as being a morality based on "science".  My second thought was I had no idea Chomsky could spit that many sick burns.	24
1	Personally, I wish you'd stop to discuss instead of moving to the next question as if this is an examination or inquisition.    Have you not noticed your questions are consistency downvoted?    Do you think there's a reason behind that?	24
1	To the mods I'm familiar with, /u/RevMelissa, /u/luluthepanda, welcome. I'm glad to have you moddi g us. For the others that I don't yet know, I look forward to getting to know you, thank you for stepping up.	24
1	IT WILL BE PANDAMONEUM.	24
1	Your actions don't match up with your stated goals. If you want to learn, read. When you have read and know something of the topic you're discussing, then converse with people. To do otherwise is inconsiderate because it wastes the time of the people who must repeatedly remedy your ignorance that you could remedy youself by exerting a minimal effort.	24
1	Hip-hip hurray!  Hip-hip hurray!  Hip-hip hurray!	24
1	To the lady mods,  how do you plan to moderate whilst staying silent? #checkmate	24
1	To start with, it's not "rather than" God. Catholics pray to God.	24
1	And it's my birthday today! 19 years and I had no idea I shared a birthday with the first major English bible...	24
1	Parable of the lost coin? We're the coin and *God* is the woman.	24
1	These are good choices.	24
1	Many of these people saying this know emprags and likes him.   I personally don't think the joke is constructive here, but I'd also like to believe they would stop it if he asked nicely.	24
1	I am not even going to pretend like I completely understood that exchange, but am I right in guessing that towards the end, Harris was getting verbally bitchslapped? Cause it seems like he is.	24
1	In reading about archeology and history of the time, realizing how much wealth and power disparity there was between the high priest and roman government officials compared to the peasants and fisherman  from Galilee.   Somehow I had always picture the struggle in Jesus' final days between people closer in social standing, not realizing it was a much more impossibly lopsided situation to have Jesus go before the high priests and Pilate.  Maybe like having a poor homeless rural migrant worker go before the State Supreme Court and Mayor of New York City to have a death penalty confirmed.	24
1	I am talking about the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come	24
1	Jesus is the son of man that will crush the serpent's head in genesis.	24
1	I've felt the sub needed female leadership for diversity.  I stepped up because the leadership team has constantly said they would choose someone who would be good for the job over and beyond gender.  I only hope I live up to the expectation.	24
1	We pray together because our relationship with each other is key to our relationship with God.  In coming together, agreeing on our pleas, and taking them before God together, we are demonstrating and fostering the kind of unity that truly invites God into our presence.  I'm not sure how much synchronized individual prayer from a booklet really fosters that.  I guess it depends on your state of mind and heart as you do it.  There might be some value if it's part of *your* love for the other members of the body of Christ.	24
1	Im the self appointed moderator of /r/sidehugs and God has just radioed me via the God signal and told me saying "Fuck that Guy" is ok when you say it in relation to /u/emprags. Being Gods Vicar on reddit makes my word final.   That settles it	24
1	That the apostles were (probably) mostly teenagers.	24
1	Its a sidehugs thing and /u/emprags is a big part of the sidehugs community its meant as a compliment really	24
1	&gt;self appointed mod of of sidehugs  Mod of sidehugs? After you led the great ShittyAskAChristian uprising of Twenty-Fourteen? Pfft.	24
1	Why does bridling your tongue inherently mean "not saying fuck?'"  Perhaps it does include that. It certainly would in many circumstances. Not necessarily in this one though.  For what it's worth, I think /u/emprags is a pretty cool guy.  I still participate in the joke.	24
1	Yeah I hear you but me and big G have got an agreement on this you can say "fuck that guy" but only in relation to emprags. See being gods Vicar on reddit makes me privy to information you may not have.  Consider it the Christian version of reddit gold.  Edit GOLD!!!!! Thank you kind stranger!	24
1	I'm sorry your church hasn't shown you the love of Christ as they should.	24
1	[Maybe from this hoax?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/24im9a/jesus_wife_papyrus_a_hoax/)  Jesus does have a wife, though:  the Church.	24
1	It's my grandpa's birthday today as well. He's a little older then you though, he turned 97. He's Christian so it's fairly relevant as well!	24
1	I often hear the claim that loving homosexual relationships didn't exist back then.  Is there any evidence for this?  I doubt it is something that could be proved anyway.  It is something I am extremely skeptical of, and I also think is is extremely insulting of those who were gay back then.	24
1	I don't think its really true, there were gay marriages in Ancient Rome for example:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Rome#Gay_marriage	24
1	The words *think* and *openly* don't do much for your argument.  Also, the whole premise is that gay people did not know how to love each other back then.  Do you not find that insulting?	24
1	Jesus never said to throw out the old covenant. That's why there was enough dispute that the Apostles actually met in Jerusalem to talk about it. In that counsel (described in Acts 15,) they said that the rules on sexual immorality still apply.	24
1	The power...it feels...liberating!  *I've got no strings to hold me down / to make me fret, or make me frown / I had strings, but now I'm free / There are no strings on me!*  Looking forward to ~~world domination~~ serving this community!	24
1	/u/emprags is active on /r/sidehugs, so this joyful announcement inspires some sidehuggers to... congratulate him in traditional /r/sidehugs ways.	24
1	By storming ~~\/r/Christianity~~ the Bastille, right?	24
1	o7  EDIT: I should probably add this for anyone who isn't familiar with me around here... I'm super happy we have some women on the mod team. It's something I've wanted for a while. /u/RevMelissa and /u/luluthepanda are awesome choices and I'm confident they'll both make many positive contributions.	24
1	But in the Latin, Jehovah begins with an I..	24
1	High-end keyboards don't make noise ' 3'	24
1	So, 1700 is when gay people magically changed from rapists to lovers?  You don't find that thought offensive?	24
1	Ikr why does he bother eating breakfast  Its like he doesn't even trust god to save him from starvation	24
1	It's clear unless you try to make it unclear, these verses have been understood as clear condemnations of homosexual acts for centuries, it's only in the last few decades that anyone has come up with complicated theories of cultural context, conveniently at the same time Western society started considering homosexual acts as not sinful.	24
1	Your tweet shows how little you know the bible :/	24
1	He also referred to Mary Magdalene in the same way ([John 20:15]).  It was a common form of address at the time.  (Plus, I think the woman in Revelation 12 represents Israel, not Mary.  The imagery is a clear reference to Joseph's dream in [Genesis 37:9-10].)	24
1	"Bless their heart" involves no vulgar words but is really an insult and tearing someone down.	24
1	Now the sub has cooties, I hope you're happy.	24
1	Not the first English language Bible, though. Everyone forgets the [Douay-Rheims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douay%E2%80%93Rheims_Bible).	24
1	&gt; the first major English bible...  *Third* major English Bible... the Tyndale Bible and the Bishops Bible both preceded it, and the King James translators cribbed from them both in many places. The Bishops' Bible was actually the "authorized" English Bible in the CoE for 50 years and its 1570s revision was the base for the KJV.	24
1	This is what anti-vaxxers have brought to us. Our cootie herd immunity was compromised when so many boys refused to get their cootie shots in 2nd grade.	24
1	What the hell is up with people posting diminished 7s?	24
1	Well, there's the Book of Mormon, which they consider scripture and no one else does.      And they aren't Trinitarian, whereas most Christians are.	24
1	What? My cootie shots are not good enough for you?	24
1	I think it is interesting the way the Isaac-Abraham narrative can be viewed as foreshadowing the Gospel narrative in which God actually does sacrifice his son; someone pointed this out to me just recently.	24
1	That depends entirely on who you ask.	24
1	If anyone would like to read about more random events from the 17th century, subscribe to my sub, /r/400YearsAgo.	24
1	[:\(](http://i.imgur.com/6MTUloH.jpg)	24
1	In Exodus, Moses's wife throws foreskin at him.	24
1	&gt; Third major English Bible...  *Fourth* major. Douay-Rheims. Which, if I'm feeling sarcastic, is also the first *complete* one.	24
1	It shows that the Arians, though not the theological majority within the church, were the ones who held significant political power and were able to do so.	24
1	Creeps can use a megachurch to hide, and they take advantage of people.	24
1	I can't believe the mods haven't banned this craphole of a website.   FTA (emphasis mine):    &gt; A leading conservative is asking why the Obama **State Department** is barring a persecuted Iraqi nun from entry into the United States to share her message about the brutal treatment of Christians in her country	24
1	If you haven't already, you should check out the book *Fear and Trembling* by Soren Kierkegaard, which analyzes this story.	24
1	Jesus talking about paying taxes to Caesar. He asks them who's face is on the coin and they reply "Caesar's." Then you get the classic "render that which is of Caesar to Caesar and that which is of God to God."   So now comes the kicker: The coin is made with the image of Caesar.  What things are made with the image of God?	24
1	Washington Post would be a reliable source. I wouldn't trust the Washington Times to give me the time of day at a Rolex convention.	24
1	Nah. We're just fucking with you.	24
1	*Fifth* major.  Most dissenting sects roundly rejected the Bishops' Bible, as well as the Douay-Rheims, in favor of the Geneva Bible.	24
1	Typical person who fell into Christianity by the geographical lottery. No worse than most, and better than some by virtue of education.  That doesn't mean improvements can't be made, but they're just typical people.	24
1	It was only an issue to some because, up until today, /r/Christianity didn't have any.  It was always said this wasn't because the team didn't feel there should be female mods, but because there hasn't been any females nominated.   Now there are two. /u/Luluthepanda and myself.	24
1	Assuming one holds the Nicene Creed as the barometer by which orthodox Christianity is measured (as most Christians do), then the crux of the matter determining the difference is that one cannot confess the Nicene Creed and remain a Mormon in good standing.   Or, so I'm told.	24
1	Hm.  I would say to just go. Once or twice. Try it out, and after a few times, decide on how you feel about it.   If it helps, just tell yourself, "hey, I'd be spending the time doing something else, anyway".   Be gentle with yourself. Peace.	24
1	Because wrong/untrue ideas can actually lead people astray, or open the door to more wrong/untrue ideas.	24
1	See a doctor.  It isn't your time to climb that wall yet, trust me.	24
1	You dont have to be a Christian to go to church! Everybody's welcome to come check things out. I know we'd think it was pretty cool of you to visit our church even if its just a cultural experience or just because you were curious.	24
1	Because its important to know what we believe in.	24
1	Oh! I'm Eastern Orthodox. But basically my point is that churches are for everybody and we really like new friends, so I'm sure almost all other churches would feel the same :)	24
1	I really don't think this is trolling. There are people who don't believe Apologetics are a useful use of time.   I would disagree with it being a waste of time, but I have friends who would disagree with me. Nature of it all, I guess.	24
1	1 (800) 273-8255  You are loved.  PM me if you want to talk.	24
1	No.  http://conspiracies.skepticproject.com/articles/zeitgeist/part-one/	24
1	Congratulations!!!  Traditionally, an Orthodox mother will spend 40 days home with her baby, and will re-enter the church after that time. The priest then says prayers over the mother, and the baby is baptized soon after that, if not the same day.	24
1	I'd pray for them.	24
1	[Horus Ruins Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0-EgjUhRqA)  [Horus Reads the Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r2m_cffRjI)	24
1	They probably were, at some point.	24
1	&gt;  Most dissenting sects roundly rejected the Bishops' Bible as well as the Douay-Rheims...  http://i.imgur.com/0nmb3.gif	24
1	What if Jesus went to Hades and preached the gospel to those who were there?	24
1	Aw, you beat me! Hail [Gozer](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140529144058/villains/images/thumb/7/7f/Gozer.jpg/300px-Gozer.jpg)!	24
1	You love copy pasting your spiel whenever you get a chance don't you?	24
1	Maybe controversial....  As a megachurch refugee, I'll say they're the McDonald's of churches. There's much better burgers out there....	24
1	Half of us are atheists anyway, so OP would fit right in.	24
1	&gt;I just do not believe in an afterlife. I wish I could, I just struggle with the concept.  Be patient, it should come with time.  &gt;If possible, could religious brother/sisters pray for me. Secular friends, could you please wish me luck in your head.  Absolutely! May God bless you in your journey my friend :)	24
1	There's a very old prayer from Mark 9:24:  "Lord, I believe; help my unbelief."  Praise God for never giving up on us; for drawing us to Himself; for giving us more than we could ever ask for or imagine!  Amen!	24
1	The coin is Caeser's, but Man is God's.	24
1	NukeThePope gets very minor publications on his CV= Sam Harris	24
1	Oooh I like this one.  In the context of a Jewish culture this would be a *drops mic* moment.	24
1	Denying science is utterly idiotic; it rejects the rational capacity of our brains and is blasphemous in the process. We are forcibly making God fit into a ludicrous box we are constructing out of a particular view of scripture rather than exploring God and the natural world rationally, particularly when God is letting us understand that he works in a much more elegant and long term way than we had previously imagined.	24
1	***Sixth*** major. We all know the Elect Standard Version (ESV) was crafted by Christ and CH Spurgeon before the foundation of the Earth.	24
1	Quite frankly, I find the creationist view of God to be *boring* if nothing else. Anyone could imagine God created the heavens, the Earth, and life just so - but the truth is far more surprising. I think the evidence reveals God to be an artist.	24
1	Oh come on you know why.  He said a bad word.	24
1	It amazes me that /u/Cabbagetroll doesn't use a macro for this. He just responds with this *every time the sub is linked*.	24
1	If you were not welcomed into any church, atheist or not, trust me.. that's not a church you wanna go to anyway.	24
1	If they don't remove them then people keep on replying to them.	24
1	Presumably by imitating the mods we already have. #aaylamo	24
1	Both things are entirely normal.	24
1	A Catholic priest explained this to me one time: "The only thing we know for sure (about who is in Heaven and who is in Hell) is God is only the judge."  His point was, God may have a very high bar for righteous judgement or it may be very low.  But because we don't know, we just have to live the best lives we can and trust in God. Heck, he has the power if he wants to forgive everyone at death and send every person to Heaven.	24
1	It isn't a proper hymn unless it's played way to slowly and everyone feels weird.	24
1	But I've heard a million times that God doesn't change.  His morality doesn't change.  Why would killing a baby who doesn't have any concept of what is going on be just?	24
1	I get teary. There have been times when I've full-on cried and sobbed out loud until my collar was wet when I knew that God was dealing with my heart and speaking to me.	24
1	The idea that smashing a child against the rocks is ever a moral thing to do is complete shit. Any on who defends such a statement is a psychopath. Anyone who claims the old testament no longer applies is copping out.  If God told me to murder a baby, I would defy a the will of God. I'll happily burn in hell before taking the life of an innocent child.	24
1	Weren't they planning to move to that spot, then it got rezoned as a response to keep them out, then as a response to that response they became a church?	24
1	Protecting them by commanding them to commit infanticide? Give me a break.	24
1	I sadly got no answer for you except to tell you good luck in your search. That same question sent me down the rabbit hole.	24
1	Interesting to see the variety of answers for this question.	24
1	I know exactly how you feel. I couldn't understand a God that could command the genital mutilation and death of **children**, who could turn women into salt blocks, who could kill all the first borns of Egypt, who could wipe out 42 young lads via bears, who could do such terrible things to the humanity that he supposedly loved. When I brought up these issues with other Christians, they could only tell me that God is good, and whatever he does *must* be good. I think this led me onto a path of realisation that I had my own morals, separate from God. and I think many Christians do as well.	24
1	I haven't formulated a response, but I just want to know if you realize why this is so unsatisfactory for people that have the same question as OP?	24
1	God commanding Israelite soldiers to kill babies and infants via the sword/spear isn't something that gets resolved by simply saying "God said so." That answer doesn't do much in settling one's conscience on the matter for most people...and understandably so.	24
1	Interesting and slightly scary. When people start to justify the killing of infants/babies it makes me quite uncomfortable.	24
1	I do. But its what I have to offer. Their outcome had more in the good pile than in the bad, paradise is no small thing. Would another outcome have been better? Maybe, but I don't know, and playing what ifs rarely leads anywhere but confusion and crossed streams.	24
1	This is horribly inappropriate for *any* thread on this sub, but especially this one. This is a warning; further participation on this sub in this way will end up with you getting banned.	24
1	I think they're talking about Hitler.	24
1	Ohhhh gotcha. Figured Hitler would show up in this thread eventually.	24
1	So you believe that if God killed someone's baby for no reason, that would be morally justified? Oh, I remember you! You didn't respond to my other comment about your son going to hell. What did you think about my reply?	24
1	This is totally off topic. The answer is probably just because of the "women and children first" idea that was woven into society. I doubt OP *actually* thinks it's *worse*.	24
1	Another thing that bothered me is that pharaoh would have let the israelites go if God didn't harden his heart. So it appears as if God really wanted to commit infanticide.	24
1	Yes, I also found that very interesting. I know there's a verse specifically where God mentions hardening the Pharaohs heart on purpose to achieve something...though I don't remember what.	24
1	Its kinda amazing how many people on this subreddit would kill another human being if God or the Pope commanded them to. Makes me wonder how many of my friends and neighbors feel the same way	24
1	because it implies they were killing civilians, and not soldiers.	24
1	&gt;God gives life and takes it whensoever He pleases. All humans are sinners and deserve death  Makes it sound like Christianity is a nihilistic death cult	24
1	Is this really justification, or is it simply people struggling to process something that none of us can realistically hope to understand?	24
1	&gt; Another thing, Gods morality is the reason you're apalled by the murder of infants.   But..doesn't God ask people to kill infants multiple times? Doesn't he kill infants himselves?	24
1	[Exodus 7:13-14 KJV]	24
1	Some of what people are saying is actual attempts at justification in my eyes. Other replies would align more with what you're saying.	24
1	How did my ex get into this	24
1	https://www.stephenministries.org/stephenministry/default.cfm/917  It's a support ministry run by lay people. Good stuff.	24
1	Why do you think death is a bad thing in the grand scheme of God's love, charity, and mercy?  Also, do you believe that the Bible is a book that isn't supposed to contain anything "evil" in it?	24
1	It's kind of disturbing	24
1	Things can be very important without being part of the canon! The last thousand years is definitely worth study.	24
1	I'm not excusing them of anything. The topic at hand is the infanticide so that is what my reply focuses more on.   Just because we can't understand his ways doesn't mean that that is an excuse for genocide and infanticide. That is something we *can* comprehend and they are some of the worst atrocities man has committed.	24
1	It makes me very, very upset, but it also explains the kind of mentality that ISIS must have. Despite the screams of their victims, the cries of the children they torture and murder, despite all that pain and suffering...deep down they are probably only doing what they think is right in God's eyes.	24
1	hmm not really... plenty of conceptions of God which don't include omnibenevolence as part of the definition.	24
1	Death is not a bad thing in the grand scheme of things. Murder, however, always is.	24
1	Wouldn't this answer also then be able to be used to justify abortion? These unborn will pass directly into paradise, and their deaths are exactly what God intended?	24
1	I've always found the idea that we can't apply our own morality to God to be very troubling. C.S. Lewis wrote, "If we once admit that what God means by 'goodness' is sheerly different from what we judge to be good, there is no difference left between pure religion and devil worship." If we can't rely on our consciences then how can we tell right from wrong at all?	24
1	It doesn't necessarily say his heart was allowed to be hardened. It seems to imply quite heavily that the pharaoh, by rejecting Moses, was doing exactly what God wanted him to do.	24
1	I never had a strong belief to begin with, but all those moral problems with the OT are only explained (from my point of view) when you look at it as mythology, the exclusive god of a certain group and the whole narrative that helps create a shared identity, from creation of the world around them, picking them as its chosen people and from then on setting rules and tests, punishing those who disobey, protecting them and crushing their enemies. It´s not that original either. So my faith didn´t die because of this but it was yet another piece to crumble very quickly the moment I gave it some thought.	24
1	God hasn't declared that we should abort anyone. We decided to do that for our own convenience. One special circumstance where God instructed the deaths of a group of children doesn't exonerate all infanticide committed by anyone ever.	24
1	&gt; All humans are sinners and deserve death  &gt; That is a wonderful thing  You sound like a psychopath to me	24
1	Interesting perspective, I feel like we don't talk about this specific question often enough.  AFAIK, in Judaism, God is not "love" like he is in Christianity, and heaven doesn't really exist. Jews just listen to the supreme being because well, He is supreme.	24
1	Because the Bible is not a Great Big Book of Everything. It is an anthology if man's interactions with God, singularly focussed on the topic of salvation.  It also does not mention squids, hockey, the great depression, or aids. And yet you might be saved by Christ anyway despite the failure to mention these things.	24
1	Clickbait?  On this sub?  Get behind me, Satan.	24
1	My thoughts exactly.  It's like no matter how bad it sounds, it somehow has to be for a good reason.	24
1	I really don't think God could've possibly commanded this, and what follows from that thought is the editors of the Hebrew Bible for one reason or another decided to (mis)attribute the genocides in the Bible to God's command.	24
1	1 Cor 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.  We don't expect you to be satisfied by our answers, at least, I don't.	24
1	2 cor 6:14  Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?   edit - Personally I think the words wickedness and darkness are terrible ways of describing non-Christian people, but there you go.	24
1	The short answer is that the canon of Scripture was decided upon by ecumenical council—in other words, a formal gathering of church leaders and representatives from all of Christendom. In theory, the canon could be "opened back up" by the same process, but schisms and divisions have made that very difficult. So even if, say, the entire Anglican Communion decided that we were going to include the Didache in the New Testament, the rest of Christendom wouldn't agree, so our claim to it being Scripture would be dubious at best.	24
1	One thing I've read made a good point: There wasn't any sort of orphanage system in those days. Killing the adults was already a death sentence for most of the children, and any that survived conquest would only do so as bitter slaves.	24
1	I don't think that making a small child watch his parents get torn apart with swords before his eyes before being stabbed in the stomach is justified, even if he gets sent to heaven afterwards. I am curious however, why didn't God just click his fingers and make these people disappear? Why did he order his men to kill them, which would have been infinitely more terrifying and painful?	24
1	My first girlfriend was a non believer. As much as I liked her I broke it off because she wasn't a Christian. The issue is that we need a partner who will help us grow in our own faith supporting it and nurturing it, as well as us for them. I mean on top of that, what are you going to do if you do get married and have kids? Will you force them to attend church with you against the will of your wife? How will you negotiate that? There is a really good sermon series on it, called Boy Meets Girl , can't remember who it's by though sorry.	24
1	The NT doesn´t make any sense if you see the OT and the god depicted in it as purely a myth.	24
1	Or, third option; God knows more than we do, and we can't understand why it had to happen, but it did. I know this isn't a satisfying answer, but it's like asking a 2 dimensional being to comprehend a 3 dimensional being's existence.	24
1	Did you honestly just say you don't see how atheists can care about people?   In terms of what you said about the OT God...so you follow, more or less, Marcionism?	24
1	You can look at a 1 month old baby and call it evil?	24
1	That is refreshingly new, but God sent Elisha to the widow, and gave her that jug of unlimited oil. He fed the 5,000. He ordered us to not oppress widows and the fatherless. I don't think that the children would have suffered so badly.  They would have probably avenged their parents, though, so yeah.	24
1	The really scary thing is, you don't even need the pope.  That's just a humans thing.  I don't have anything resembling a link, but apparently there was an experiment where people were asked to administer electric shocks to a test subject (actually an actor, no actual shocks) in another room, and over 90% of them proceeded not just past the lethal threshhold but past the apparent death of the test subject, _just because the guy with the clipboard and lab coat told them to_.	24
1	That's like being grateful your spouse beat your child and not you.	24
1	Children are not innocent - we are all born with sin. My toddler almost certainly has displayed envy, greed, gluttony, and has hit other toddlers in anger...and he hasn't even reached 2 years yet.   Your statement does not agree with what I've learned from my religious upbringing that we are all born with sin, nor does it jive with my observations that our tendency to behave in sinful ways is evident from childhood.	24
1	I have never looked at the untranslated text, but the phrase "God hardened the Pharaoh's heart" always struck me as an idiom and not a literal act.	24
1	The point still stands. "Thanks for not smiting me"  A god who points a gun to your head and says "love me" is no God of love.	24
1	That's a potentially problematic course when His Word and His followers committed infanticide, genocide, and slavery.  I think historical context will always have play a significant role in understanding the Bible.	24
1	Exodus 7:3-4 says, “But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt he will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and with mighty acts of judgment I will bring out my people the Israelites.” It seems unjust for God to harden Pharaoh’s heart and then to punish Pharaoh and Egypt for what Pharaoh decided when his heart was hardened. Why would God harden Pharaoh’s heart just so He could judge Egypt more severely with additional plagues?  Read more: http://www.gotquestions.org/God-harden-Pharaoh-heart.html#ixzz3Z3BCcDDc	24
1	So all the murdery rapey people from ancient times are in heaven, but perfectly decent people who can't bring themselves to believe in God are going to burn in hell forever?	24
1	See, that idea is profoundly disturbing to me - that an utterly reprehensible action can be morally right simply because God endorses it. It's very *1984*ish, that we can't rely upon our own assessments of anything. How can "God is good" mean anything if our conception of "good" simply means "whatever God is"?	24
1	&gt;why didn't God just click his fingers and make these people disappear? Why did he order his men to kill them  This is just the first thing that came to mind, so take it with a grain of salt.  God *rarely* works without means. He creates through words, saves through sacrifices, provides through manna, forgives through water, bread, and wine, and ultimately reconciled the world to Himself through the death and resurrection of His Son. So it really isn't that surprising that he didn't just *poof* these people away. Just a thought.  Edit: please read the question I'm answering	24
1	Your son doesn't know the difference between right and wrong, and that's all Adam and Eve had in the garden. That's all the fruit of the tree of good and evil showed them. When we know right from wrong we are culpable but when we don't we are innocent.  [This is a decent explanation]( https://bible.org/question/what-does-bible-say-about-age-accountability) of the idea. It's not that they aren't capable of wrong action, it's that they are not culpable.	24
1	&gt;It's very 1984ish,   The term 'Orwellian' is a little sexier.	24
1	If that were the case then you would think the main character of the NT would have addressed that issue instead of tirelessly quoting and reading from the OT	24
1	But if the difficult stories of the OT were all part of the Israelites justifying their actions, wouldn't Jesus have made it a point to rebuke the prophets of old, instead of following and reading those texts to the people?	24
1	Great question. It is really weird. It's like if your wife cheated on you and divorced you, you might hate her, but you wouldn't convince yourself she had never existed.	24
1	But if the Creator of the universe were evil, would we be obliged to call his evil good, because we belonged to him?	24
1	&gt;God judged these people, and used the Israelites to simply carry out his judgement.  Why not use his angels of death, a natural disaster, or a plague.   Surely God would understand the dangerous precedent it sets if he sometimes will use people to carry out a genocide for him. And surely he would understand the trauma it would cause to the soldiers that had to "simply" carry out the slaughter of crying babies, toddlers and playing children.	24
1	People killed babies pretty casually throughout history. We tend to overestimate the reliability of our consciences. Hence our desire to find something external.	24
1	The church has never stopped documenting important events and issues. They are called [encyclicals](http://www.papalencyclicals.net), and while they don't have the weight as scripture they carry a lot of weight because they become a part of Sacred Tradition.   Here is [Mit Brennender Sorge](http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius11/P11BRENN.HTM) (On the Church and the German Reich)  of Pope Pius XI, March 14, 1937.	24
1	"They'll probably grow up to become murderers anyway!" doesn't seem like a solid excuse for killing infants.	24
1	There's nothing morally wrong with God killing infants himself. He literally kills everyone himself. He's the arbiter of life and death. I agree that his command of people to kill is very troublesome, but I've never been even remotely troubled by God killing someone himself	24
1	&gt;If you don't have a church that emphasizes this it truly is a waste of time.  Translation: If your church doesn't use the same language as /u/gameplayer123's church, then he claims its truly a waste of time.  Given your false witness against the Eastern Orthodox in the other thread, you should not be making such comments.	24
1	If the baby is born, it might grow up, die, and end up in Hell. If it's aborted, it's guaranteed to go to Heaven. Therefore, abortion is the ultimate act of morality and love: we're ensuring they get paradise, and ensuring they never even risk eternal suffering.  This is a necessary consequence of 'dead infants automatically go to Heaven'.. The only retort I've seen to this is, 'God doesn't want us to do that'.  Well, that just makes abortion doctors and pro-choice people more moral than God :)	24
1	Does that mean your son deserves an eternity of suffering, if he were to die tomorrow? Because he showed envy?	24
1	Took communion for the first time.  Pascal was beautiful, brought tears to my eyes again. They had an older gentleman who looked like a bishop or something at service.  He told a story that spoke to me personally.	24
1	That in an of itself is not a good enough reason, but everybody dies, and God is allowed shut down entire nations. On top of that, he is able to place people in every nation and time period, who will deserve the final outcome.  I say that cautiously. I don't want to think backwards, and conclude that everybody deserves what he gets. I'm just saying that it is all possible.	24
1	First, we all have a different religious upbringing.  Your particular one isn't the only way.  IN fact, it isn't even the oldest way of doing things.  Ancient Christians generally agreed with the first post.  Jesus said, "Let the little Children come to me, do not hinder them."  and He also told us that unless we become *like children* we will have difficulty.  One could say that Adam and Eve were like children in the Garden, not having knowledge of Good and Evil.  There thousands of years of belief and Orthodoxy in the belief that Children go to be with God.	24
1	There was a discussion about this on /r/AcademicBiblical.   https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/2zwu5c/so_why_exactly_hasnt_the_biblical_canon_been/cpnq4fv  Short answer, the criterion for selecting works to add to the NT was authorship by the Apostles or someone close to them.	24
1	Isn't that basically the same argument many people use to justify abortion? "I can't provide a good life for a child at 16" or , "this child will be disabled and have only a painful life/detract from my ability to care for my other children."	24
1	I had a sermon, all written out and ready to go. I got in the car and felt called to go in a completely different direction. It was the very first time I went up front without anything and preached off the cuff.  (I talked about the figurative understanding of Mary and Jesus. We can see them literally Mother and Son, and we can see them as figurative. God gives all of us a mission to birth. We are called to be the human side of that creation.)	24
1	You have added conclusions and assumptions not made in my original claim, and removed ones that a Christian would automatically include, like the abhorrence of murder in all circumstances except those where God had made exception. That point alone demonstrates that abortion is not morally correct let alone how ridiculous it is to suggest that hymns could ever be more moral than the creator of morality, and do it by sinning.  This line of discussion is ridiculous. You haven't adequately supported your premise.	24
1	This also confuses me... maybe it wouldn't have been helpful for Jesus to go around saying "toss out everything in the Old books, it's all made up". Maybe he wanted to prove through his life and works that God is truly good, rather than trying to prove this by calling out mistakes in the OT.  He also did things like stop a stoning from happening, healing on the Sabbath... it doesn't seem like he acted as if the OT was infallible and all correct.	24
1	I can guy that argument, but then your second one;  &gt;It is accurate to say God kills people in the same way it is accurate to say He births people, in that all deaths and births happen on His say so.  If that is the case then the abortionist acts at God's command do they not? It can't be both ways, either god wills the abortions, or all deaths *don't* happen on his say so.	24
1	Yup!  And to be perfectly clear, this is one of those things people get wrong all the time about *sola scriptura*.  *Sola scriptura* means, fundamentally, that scripture is *sufficient* in terms of providing information necessary for salvation.  This does not mean that  * The Bible is 100% correct about everything. * You have to accept the entire Bible to collect all necessary information. * Other resources cannot contain valuable information for personal faith development. * Other resources should never be consulted in spiritual matters.	24
1	How do we know all infants go to heaven? That is not in scripture and that is not what Christianity taught in the first 1600 years or so.	24
1	I think you are mistaking the linguistic convention of that verse for a theological truth. Other versions translate the same passage differently.  https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%207&amp;version=NIV	24
1	I've always assumed that "like children" refers to a child's willingness and eagerness to believe, not their innocence.	24
1	I served as chalice bearer for the first time ever. I'm still reeling from it. I'm so moved. How else to put it? It was a dense experience, full of details that I'll be remembering and savoring all week.  You know what it was like? Every time someone took the cup, it was almost the same experience as when I take it myself. So, again, a very rich and dense several minutes.	24
1	Please make sure you get some counseling.  Do you have someone in clergy to speak to?	24
1	That is such a saddening statement to hear :(	24
1	I was hoping you'd tell us about it.  Glad it went well for you.  I served at the rail today myself and it was great.	24
1	I'm sorry to hear that, bro. It's been four 1/2 years since I discovered my wife's infidelity and that long since I've see my daughter. It still hurts and there's not a day that goes by that I don't think about it. But It gets more manageable, slowly. I wish there was something I could say to make it less painful for you. Just know that you aren't alone and there are people who care about you.  Hang in there, man.	24
1	If you say that "God's ways cannot be understood" then what use has the Bible?  If we cannot make sense of the infanticide therein than why can we claim to make sense of the various other methods Christians claim the Bible represents?  It seems, to me as a former Christian, like selective evaluation steeped in a desire to maintain ones faith.	24
1	Teachings of love, compassion and mercy tend to go against such actions. I don't know if Jesus thought those actions were wrong but he certainly taught us differently now.	24
1	No, the BoM was a gift. I was never religious.	24

1	Thank you for the kind word and solid advice. I got a full screening and I'm clean thank God. My children are so little, they're 2 years old and 8 months old but they know that something is up... I just keep acting like nothing happened and try to have as much fun as possible with them.	24
1	Don't let yourself be alienated from them. Make sure they know they're loved. This isn't your fault either, don't let those thoughts creep up on you.	24

1	I think Christ was aware of the OT, but I do believe he may have undermined it indirectly (cf. his approach to *life* superseded that of the OT; as in, the law wasn't removed, but it was reinterpreted through this new Rabbi, Christ). There's a massive, massive contrast between the OT and NT that it becomes incredibly different to reconcile the two. The question is this: is the OT meant to be reconciled?	24

1	I'm an iconoclast. I don't own any.  Edit: to clarify, I don't feel like Christ would have us establish religious significance to objects or places. It borders too close to idolatry.	24

1	ITT: People downvoting someone for having a different opinion about religious objects. Come on, guys.  So when you say you don't own any, how far does that extend? Crosses, pictures, bibles?	24
1	Well done, this response should be heavily considered when someone questions these things. There's alot more then God just commanding things, the old testament is one big story of a Creator dealing with His wicked creation.	24
1	"You have to condone Charles Manson if you are fine with religious people"   I'm afraid I don't follow this logic.	24
1	Have you spoken to your rabbi?    If you feel called to Jesus, that's one thing.  Changing your belief structure based on fear is another.  Fear isn't a good motivator.  It doesn't lead us to make good decisions.	24
1	Christians have been preaching a bad message for a long time. While hell is real, avoiding hell isn't one of the goals of Christianity. Jesus rarely spoke about it. Rather, the focus is on your faith manifesting through love.The most repeated command in the bible is some version of "do not be afraid". Or "fear not". This is because if you know who God is... a loving father... then you can trust him and do not need to fear anything. Not death, not hell. The ultimate ideal is that you will be fearless enough to love those who are unlovable.	24
1	This is considered proof that all infants go to heaven?  This is merely why we hope that children who are unbaptized are able to go to heaven by the grace of God.	24
1	I just became Pope!	24
1	Kind of surprised at the amount of people defending infanticide in this thread.  You guys scare me.	24
1	&gt; Children are innocent and go to be with the Father when they die, so those children saw Paradise.   Even if they didn't accept Jesus?   What bothers me more is that we can use that same methodology to "accept" any atrocity.   Little girl gets kidnapped, raped, strangled and is buried in a shallow grave? Horrible, but she's with God now.   Thousands of little Jewish kids got gassed today by the Nazis in Treblinka? Also sucks, but they're with God now, too.	24
1	Does everyone really deserve death?  I'm not sure about that.  I can understand a potter being able to destroy pots, but pots are just clay.  They don't feel and don't love or feel compassion or hardship.  If they did, I don't think I'd be okay with the potter smashing pots even if the potter made them leaky.     Another thing that bothers me is the notion that second guessing the Bible is second guessing God.  Is this really how all of us think?  Does the Bible have to be 100% true for God to be true?	24
1	I was studying at a Southern Baptist seminary when I first went to Mass after years of reading the writings of the earliest Christians and Catholic theology. The Church wasn't beautiful, the preaching was bad, but Jesus Christ was there in His Church in the Eucharist. I've been a Catholic for about 8 years now.	24
1	Don't force it. A false conversion will just cause you and others more hurt and pain down the road.	24
1	It likely depends on your denomination.	24
1	Anyone *can* baptise anyone; as long as you are baptised in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, your baptism is legit.   Might still be good to run the idea by your pastor, since (a) I'm sure they will want to at least know *that you are getting baptised* and (b) if you explain to them why you want this other pastor to baptise you, I'm sure they'll understand; but if they hear about it seconf-hand, it might hurt their feelings.	24
1	In emergencies, as far as I know, all churches say that anyone can administer baptism. In non-emergencies, some churches (generally those that believe in ordaining clergy) believe that it is proper for a priest to administer baptism. In churches that don't ordain clergy or have a sacramental theology, I'm pretty sure it's normal for anyone to baptize. Some churches would have a problem with a woman administering a public baptism. What kind of church do you go to?	24
1	I thought it was interesting that maternity ward nurses are often taught how to baptize — in the event that an infant is close to death and a priest can't be summoned in time.  In the Catholic Church, the ordinary method of baptism is by a priest. In extraordinary circumstances, anyone can baptize (even an atheist), as long as it's done using the trinitarian formula.	24
1	That's a child of a covenant. We have no such sense regarding Canaanite children.	24
1	I think I remember Trey Parker and Matt Stone (Creators of South Park) saying that after they made an episode criticizing Richard Dawkins and came out saying they weren't atheists, Penn kept calling and faxing them saying he was disappointed in them.  I have a theory the only reason Matt Stone finally said he was an atheist years later, was to get Penn to stop asking him about it, but that's just an assumption.	24
1	That's the same thing though. Struggling to find rationalizations for "why genocide against a whole people unnecessarily, including even killing the children, but leaving alive the young girls simply because you want to rape them is good" is not something you can pass off as reasonable. They're placing not wanting to question an obviously heavily immoral traditionalist interpretation above the reality of how bad these things were. And yet these very same people would probably find it appalling if someone in modern day did something this unrepentantly bad saying God ordered it, rightfully realizing that its incoherent to tie an all good nature to things which are not good.	24
1	Thank you for this. I am currently questioning my faith right now too, and it is difficult to reconcile these things.  Knowing that others are going through it too at least makes me feel a little better about it.	24
1	Even if they do look like OP, can't hurt to get a paternity test.	24
1	So if you're beaten and raped, it's your responsibility to care for a resulting child? Or if you're molested by your father at the age of 12 it's your responsibility to care for a resulting child? Interesting assertion.	24
1	To make sure the kids are actually his.	24
1	I'm not sure you're reading the actual link you posted.   1. That's not the catechism. it's a report from a committee.   2. This is the actual claim it makes:   &gt; The conclusion of this study is that there are theological and liturgical reasons to hope that infants who die without baptism may be saved and brought into eternal happiness, even if there is not an explicit teaching on this question found in Revelation.   That is to say, basically, "we have good reason to accept that one can hope these kids wind up in heaven," not "the Church teaches infallibly that all kids go to heaven."	24
1	Well if she takes the kids and divorces him, he might not want to be paying child support for the next 18 years for kids that aren't even his.	24
1	He might want the kids, but it is only fair that somebody else help to pay to raise them. I don't know what laws and rights are available, but it's good for us to at least discuss his options.	24
1	Have you tried asking her on a date?	24

1	It's most likely a psychological phenomena induced by group expectation and excitation of emotion.  I believe it's the case that actual speaking in tongues is supposed to actually be understandable. A real language, though not one you could possibly speak at the moment.

1	I'm not sure your analogy is accurate though. Popcorn is not objectively delicious, that's subjective based on taste and preference. Does God exist only for certain people? I don't think so it's more of a binary thing either God exists or does not.	24

Unless I look, taste, whatever, for myself, I will never know. The object will prove its self. Look at it metaphorically. Not literally.	24
1	It sounds like you might be suffering from stress and depression. I've been there , it will get better.  Go and see a doctor, get some time to think, speak to your course leaders (?). They should be able to aid you.  You are not the only person  who has gone through this, there should be processes in place to help you.	24
1	If missions are focused on conversion, or hold aid ransom until lip service has been paid to the religion - yes, they are worthless.  If missions are focused on aid, or in the best case *only* bring aid - the mission is worthwhile.	24
1	Yeah, if you're going to a slum in a third world nation to try and convince people of the gospel, it's a total waste of time and money. It's pretty hard to justify those sort of mission trips when the people being preached at are literally naked and starving.	24
1	Only in the context of bible.  Never as a threat.   Children need to develop a loving relationship with God and not one based on fear of Hell.	24

1	What would be a pro-suicide bible story? I can't recall any off the top of my head...	24
1	Is that pro-suicide though? I see that story as "Hey look this guy committed suicide!" Not necessarily a moral judgment on the situation, just a statement.  Most people in the Old Testament aren't great behavioral role models anyways...	24

1	This seems to have become sort of a meme here, whenever someone talks about sexual purity, someone always yells, "but what about the poor?"  It reminds of Judas  shouting, "but what about the poor" to the woman who was using ointment to wash Jesus' feet.  [John 12:4-7]	24

1	Give them proof.  If you can't prove it, they have no more reason to believe you than you have to believe that they have a pet dragon that nobody else can see.  Anecdotal evidence isn't proof.	24
1	The "purity" argument is an illusion.    I had a girlfriend who was the most anal person about "remaining pure." She took it to the point of almost worshipping purity for just the sake of being pure. It was the most absurd thing. It was then that I realized that we have elevated "sexual purity" to such an insane level that it stopped being about God at all, and started being about us. Very pharisaical.	24
1	...but God knows what would convince me and either he doesn't care or he doesn't exist.	24
1	I'm going to join in, this is beautiful. My knot is my difficulty with structure, discipline, and my prayer life, ironically :) May God and the Theotokos help us!  There's also a certain beautiful irony in the fact that i'll be praying this on a (knotted!) prayer rope.	24
1	&gt;"I want prayer in this school," outraged parent Angila Waddell said. "I am proud to see our football team take a knee and pray before and after games. And also in clubs. And we're just shocked."  I bet her tune would be a whole lot different if the football team was prostrating towards Mecca before and after games.	24

1	I think people tend to underestimate what *eternity* means.  We live about 75-80 years.  That's a long time for us.  That's our whole lives.  But now consider 80 years compared to a thousand.  Already seems insignificant.  Now consider 80 years compared to fucking *eternity*.  That's literally an unlimited amount of lifetimes.  I don't think even Hitler deserves that shit. And this asswipe says his son deserves *that* for **TWO YEARS** of being a little jealous?  This is why.  This is why people become atheists.	24

1	&gt;Government employee fired after endorsing a religion in his capacity as an agent of a secular state that is forbidden to endorse any religion	24
1	At least we still have Bibleman.	24
1	Just to be clear, prayer is actually allowed in school. Government employees, however, are not allowed to endorse or promote any religion as it would be a violation of the separation of church and state.   Students can still pray on their own accord. They can still read the bible in school. They can still say a prayer before eating lunch. Students can still gather together for religious study.  You wouldn't know that based on Fox "News" deliberately spinning things.	24
1	yeah, the day fox news is actually "fair and balanced" is the day I may actually watch them.	24
1	It sounds like the team was all basically pressured into it. In situations like that anyone not doing it directly calls attention to themselves as different and an outsider. In the heavily Christian US, particularly in the south and more so in rural areas everywhere, identifying as a non Christian often leads to mockery, bullying, alienation, etc.	24

For help to cultivate sincere gratitude.	24
1	I think this great! I only somewhat recently became comfortable with Marian devotion, and have been trying to pray the Rosay every day... So, instead of a prayer request, I have a question. When should the Act of Contrition be said? Before the Apostles' Creed, or directly after the Apostles' Creed, which is where I know some people usually state their intentions? or maybe some other option?	24
1	Christians make up the majority population of western nations.	24
1	What did this man have against cleavage?	24
1	Being friendly is important to me, i dont wish to hurt people, even if we disagree about something, disagreeing is something many of us do on numerous topics and the best way to find a world in which we can live together freely and openly is to be open minded and friendly in our discourse :)	24
1	That is absolutely ridiculous and a perversion of God's ultimate justice as defined in Scripture: unfailing love and equitably measured response.	24

1	Man, I've got to become an ordained minister as soon as possible so I can make my wealth of accrued disrespect work for me like this guy did.  Girls are sending him jug pics and he just made it part of his job description!  My pastor got fired for having pics like that!	24
1	I thought it was going to be something about modesty, nope, he's just calling women ugly.  &gt;Hutchings addressed his original Facebook post to "insecure women" who he said "conveniently" include their chests in their selfies.

1	I would not go to a synagogue with a flag. Keep such things out of services.	24
1	The picture is super interesting! The priests also wear vestments to distort their human figure-that way, we're focused more on the service, worship, and Sacraments, rather than the dude standing up there.	24
1	More than half lose their virginiy before marriage? I was being pessimistic, it seems, I would have thought it was near 98%.	24
1	Times have changed so much. As a child the church I attended had an argument whether the Christian flag should be at the right of the minister, or the right of the congregation!	24
1	For anyone interested, I found a [higher resolution picture](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Qc9I6z-hrsQ/URVTpnhrZ2I/AAAAAAAAAKk/fOyuiqHji_Q/s1600/Picture1.png) of the graphic that's much easier to read.	24
1	Hey, lets have a big group of kids, plant some we know will sign the pledge, and then make everyone feel like they must sign the thing to be right with God.  What could possibly go wrong?	24
1	I think the Christian flag is a sign of the same nationalism.  Why do we need a Christian flag?  Because we have an American flag.	24
1	I think its a generational divide. At my church, the millennials are inclined to complain about the flags in the sanctuary, and the older generations can't imagine not having them.	24
1	His words can essentially be paraphrased as   "I know you're trying to make up for your ugly face, and no wonder you're insecure about it, but your titties are ugly too. Eww, I don't need to look at your gross face or body."	24
1	Me too. B.B. King inspired me to pick up guitar. He's the *reason* I've been playing for the last decade, and he's always been an incredibly faithful man.

Feel like I've got a lot more to give"	24
1	How is it elevating themselves above the congregation?  &gt;"we are the mediators between God and humanity and we are the only ones with the ability to approach God and hear His Voice so therefore you must go through us."  Well, we know that the only true mediator between God and humanity is Christ. I don't think wearing clothes that distinguish one's job really means that they're the only ones to approach God.	24
1	The outfit looks so wrong without a beard drawn in!	24
1	Pretty much every religion is being persecuted more then Christians in Western countries. What about the persecution led by Christians? Muslims, Atheists, Sikhs. Sikhs are some of the chillest people around yet they're confused for 'terrorists' because they wear turbans. There is very, very little persecution against Christians. The persecution that some Christians propagate is more then Christianity as a whole receives.  *Talking specifically about the US/Western Nations. In the Middle east and other countries, Christians are unfortunately persecuted.	24

1	As someone new to the Orthodox Church myself, your view is quite contrasting to my actual experience. I find that Protestant churches tend to have the pastor on a platform, which is usually higher than that in an Orthodox church (if there even is a platform). Secondly, the priest is just another participant in the service. Most of the time, the priest faces the same direction as the people. Additionally, you often can't see the priest (shows how important he is!) and it doesn't even make a difference to my experience.	24
1	Perfectly said, thank you.  I guess what I was reaching for is: whatever's communicated by a flag, it's orthogonal to what the church is *supposed* to be communicating.  And as you say, what *is* communicated by a flag, anyway?  "Hey, if you thought you were in Canada, your GPS is really wacked."  &gt; PRIUS DRIVERS ACTUALLY ARE ALL GAY.  Yes.  Yes, we are.	24
1	Well, what would you have people do? Yes, we can encourage teenagers and young adults to practice abstinence, but clearly it will not work on all. It wont ever work for *half*. Do you suggest we socially stigmatise those who have premarital sex as "immoral" or "unclean"? How do we do that without discriminating against them, or bullying them? Should we stigmatise them for simply following their strongest biological urges? Even if the parents punish them, what will that do, except teach them to not get caught doing it?	24
1	The colors actually have to do with the liturgical year-different colors represent different things (and are coordinated between vestments for the priest and altar-servers, as well as the cloths on the altar and under the icons). I can probably get you some information on that if you're curious.	24
1	Ugh, your insistence on vestments that don't look like childrens' art projects is the main impediment to Episcopal-Orthodox rapprochement.	24
1	It would bother me too. In fact our church forbids national flags in the sanctuary and military/patriotic hymns.	24
1	[I miss the days when this blog updated.](http://badvestments.blogspot.com/) We need it now more than ever...	24
1	I've spoken to an orthodox priest.  Every bit has meaning, but when they put on white or gold, they are putting on Christ.  Having attended a vestal service, he goes from full black, indicating his own sin, to full white, as he represents Christ's own presence in the room.	24
1	[FTFY](http://i.imgur.com/faKiNCU.png)	24
1	Vestments are not an elevating of the priests above the congregation. They are priestly garb which shows their role in the church and their service to both God and their fellow man.   Compare that to some mega church situations where the pastor might dress like everyone else, but he's an almost cult leader type person. The service is all about the sermon, and the church is all about him. That's why some of these never survive a pastor change.	24
1	Umm, you are taking the wrong message from my post. Hindus in North America have as much right to practice their faith as anyone else. My post deals with the hostility that the Hindu chauvinists in India have let loose on Christians.	24
1	That's even more disturbing!	24
1	Yep. He repeats himself quite a bit, so I was fairly liberal with the fast forwarding. I still got the whole of the message.	24
1	I saw Rowan Williams, but I read Rowan Atkinson. Now I'm thinking a Dawkins/Atkinson debate would be hilariously fantastic.	24
1	&gt;We have China, Haiti, India, Malawi, and the USA hanging in the sanctuary as a reminder that Jesus is king over those nations.  Now that is perfectly fine, I'd say.	24
1	That's a tough one. Its practically safer not to associate oneself with a gang, even accidentally. Still.	24
1	It's true - they are.   Certain colors are worn depending on your "set".  This is common in a lot of areas with Hispanic gangs.	24
1	Rosaries should definitely be against the dress code in every state of this purely Christian country. Not only are they representative of gangs and gang activity, but they also represent the Catholic Church which is of course backed by the Illuminati. In fact, why did you even post this to /r/Christianity? Everyone knows Catholics aren't Christians.  ^^^^/s	24
1	Top level sarcasm. 10/10, was frothy.	24
1	Because they're plastic rosaries with gang colors?  But muh war on Christianity!	24
1	I have handed those things out. And I regret doing so sincerely. I think the Gospel deserves to be explained lovingly and with great intimacy. I see tracts as a sign of disorder in hospitality.	24
1	I don't know if you understand gangs. Often times they individuate themselves with some signifier; manner of dressing, speech, tattoo, jewelry, etc. For example, the Bloods wear red. Its not saying that you shouldn't be allowed to wear red. Its saying that if you live in such an area, you should be wary of what a particular outfit might convey. In hispanic areas, rosaries are being worn to communicate meaning. It can be dangerous to wear them, you might be mistaken for a member of a gang.	24
1	They are. Except for holy week they've been unofficially banned, at least in High Schools, here in Tucson for years.   Images of Mother Mary (our Lady of Guadalupe), and of course Santa Muerte are also banned.	24
1	A priest who works in an area with a lot of gang related activity.	24
1	Ia! Ia! Cthulhu Fhtagn!	24
1	I almost vomited hate onto the keyboard until I got to your /s. Way to make me feel like such an idiot.	24
1	No. My experiences with people handing out tracts has unfortunately been universally negative. I don't want to present the Gospel to others the same way it was presented to me by those folks.	24
1	The Cathocreps and the Orthobloods..	24
1	how does bb king relate to christianity? i have no problems with praying for him, but im just curious why this is posted to this specific sub	24
1	Also, the cuffs the priest wear, which don't seem to be pictured, both hold their sleeves in place, and symbolize that their hands are the hands of God.	24
1	Depending on your area, a rosary very well might be a gang associated symbol, especially if it's a certain color.	24
1	&gt;the Catholic Church which is of course backed by the Illuminati.  No, no, no, you got it backwards. The Catholic Church *founded* the Illuminati, along with the Masons, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, Islam, Nazism, Communism, etc.	24
1	Why not? And why not commemorate the small people too?	24
1	I know, but the Illuminati, after being founded by the Catholic Church, accumulated enough wealth to outstrip the Church and of course build the [Denver airport in 1994](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_International_Airport) (the same year Kurt Cobain performed that Satanic ritual with a shotgun).  We truly are living in the end times, brother.	24
1	Considering rosaries aren't supposed to be worn as jewelry anyways, I don't see the big problem.	24
1	I don't think that's true in Hispanic cultures, though.	24
1	There are specific subreddits with much more specific  goals, but there are also larger subreddits which can incorporate several aspects. Should there not be any discussion of scripture or the theology because /r/AcademicBiblical exists? Should there not be any prayer requests here because /r/PrayerRequests exists? If we overly stratify this sub into various smaller functional subs, what content remains?	24
1	Yeah, in fact, MS13 and the Mexican Mafia use SM imagery in various ways. Plus there's the whole increase of the syncretism of Mexican/Latin culture everywhere in Tucson in art, music, the exploding popularity of the Dia de los Muertos celebration, etc... Santa Muerte means a bunch of different things to a bunch of different groups, the gang element being just one, but she's everywhere.   And yeah, Eegees!	24
1	B.B King was a life-long Christian, a man who *changed guitar forever*, and an incredibly faithful person who helped lead me to God. Stop being so cynical (that's a lesson I myself have had to learn over the last few days through this subreddit)	24
1	Because he was a life-long faithful man, who preached the Gospel to people wide and far through his music, and was always thankful to God. Here, [check out this song by him and Buddy Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emyt-agLE_s)	24
1	You are now a mod of /r/ChristiansAwake2NWO	24
1	The gangs are pretty slick.  They can't wear hats, bandanas, etc. so they go with this.  If they ban rosaries they will probably move to rings or colored contact lenses next (only half joking here)	24
1	Dude, come on. This is akin to banning Islamic religious attire for "terrorist activity" :p	24
1	Plus in New Mexico, they're all Mexicans, which is obviously unamerican. /s	24
1	No, I don't think it's like that at all. First, headwear serves a different function for the Muslim than a rosary does for a Christian. Second, nobody is saying these kids can't wear the rosaries because they are trying to put an end to gang activity; they are saying that it isn't prudent for these kids to wear these rosaries because it could make them victims of gang violence.    Look, I wear a rosary, and I'd be happy to let my kids do the same. But if that rosary could threaten their lives, is it really worth it? Especially since the rosary is more important functionally than aesthetically?	24
1	If you don't live in an area with a lot of Hispanic gangs it might seem unreal, but I am telling you with all certainty it is a thing.	24
1	I'll admit, as a Protestant currently finishing a college course in the Reformation I had a good chuckle at this.	24
1	What does this have to do with Christianity?	24
1	Seems like that would be a tax nightmare. Regardless, I'm glad they're giving thought to how the government might recognize relationships that currently have no significant legal standing.	24
1	I love Chic tracts! They're the finest source of comedy this world has ever seen! [Christian beware, dungeons and dragons cult.](http://www.chick.com/READING/TRACTS/0046/0046_01.ASP)	24
1	&gt;Didn't Jesus dress as those in the surrounding culture dressed?  Sure! But He wasn't a priest-and even rabbis wore different garments at that time.   &gt;If I walk into a room, I don't want to know which man or woman is clergy just by looking around at their attire, I'd much rather learn it by how they conduct themselves.  By that logic, ideally, you should think everyone in the room is clergy, right?	24
1	Yes, but the Rosary is not a necklace anyway. It's traditionally tucked into one's belt.	24
1	I think any tract that is designed to look like money is doing an incredible disservice to the Gospel as well as just ridiculous to give to someone.  You're literally doing "bait-and-switch", how is that a loving way of giving the Good News?	24
1	What does legalization of gay marriage ever have to do with Christianity?  Yet we still have posts about it.  Just imagine that OP asked the implicit question: "Is polygamy something that can be supported in Christianity?"	24
1	Just more slippery slope scaremongering about how allowing gay people to get married will destroy society as we know it.   For context, the Green party has a total of 1 MP (out of a total of 650). They are a political non-entity, the vast majority of British people wouldn't be able to tell you who Natalie Bennett is, and her views on marriage are entirely irrelevant.	24
1	Given this person's posting history, I'm going to go on a limb and say he thinks that if America legalizes gay marriage, soon we'll legalize polygamy, and then we'll legalize beastiality, and then pretty soon we've got 400,000 people married to warm bagels.	24
1	Mmmm. I could go for a bagel right now.	24
1	I'd say one can make a pro-polygamist argument from the Bible, sure.	24
1	BAGELS ARE AN AFFRONT TO THE LORD EVERYONE KNOWS THAT  *but seriously, a bagel does sound good right now*	24
1	For one, they are not *actually* green; instead, their skin colors fall within the normal range of human skin colors.	24
1	I don't see the problem with her statement, or what it has to do with Christianity.	24
1	I think it's a logical conclusion to how a lot of people feel about marriage.  For a lot of people, it seems to be enough that people are consenting adults that wish to marry.  If that's the case, there's no reason to disallow multiple people from marrying.	24
1	I'm a big believer in people being allowed to do what they want as long as it doesn't infringe on other people's rights.  As far as marriage goes, I think the one rule is "be consenting adults."  So it doesn't matter what a person's sex is, their fertility, or how many people want to get married.	24
1	Well, I think everybody justifies religion in their own way.  I just don't feel any rules about it are fair to impress upon everyone except for being an adult and consenting.	24
1	It's actually not begging the question because they weren't attempting to make an argument, just stating their own opinion. Nice try, though.	24
1	&gt; '73 all the liberals were saying that no woman actually wants an abortion  Considering abortion's history goes back pretty damn far, I believe that this is just a crock. Clearly there are people that wanted an abortion if it was going through the courts. Give me a break with your revisionism.	24
1	I will not stand for this cultural appropriation!	24
1	You had to get to the /s to realize that? ;D	24
1	I really just can't bring myself to care if people want a plural marriage.  I certainly won't be joining them, but they can have at it.  It's no skin off my back.	24
1	Man, you seriously need to watch some CSI or Walker, Texas Ranger. Priests and churches are neutral ground and good priests have an ear out for their community  So ya, I would trust an "urban" priest to have the low down on the current territory and dress codes of the troublemakers in his community  If gang A has rosaries integrated into their dress codes, you sure as hell don't want innocent Catholic children flashing rosaries and getting gun down by rivals of gang A	24
1	Solomon had 700 wives. 3-way marriages are traditional.	24
1	Listen, some people actually believe what he wrote. I've met plenty of them, so even reading a sentence of those type of thoughts sets me into attack mode.	24
1	Ok so besides consent what are the requirements?	24
1	While *technically* the term heresy is acceptable in this statement (as every church sees other churches as being in heresy), you're really toeing the line on 1.3 here.	24
1	Wow, this subreddit is on a roll with posts like these. The amount of people that are apostating is mind-numbing and jarring; it's like being hit with a curveball and I'm not even Christian. O_O	24
1	My point was you said marriage was justified by more than consent. If it is a man and a woman who want to get married what are the other requirements?	24
1	I understand, and I appreciate your courage and honesty. I hope you find forgiveness. And peace also; it can be very difficult to relinquish faith. Please know you are always welcome here, no matter what you believe.   As someone who has been through a period of unbelief and ultimately returned to the faith, my inbox is always open to you.	24
1	We do get a lot of posts from people who have also come back to God.	24
1	Oh yeah, you're completely right. It must've been confirmation bias on my part because the people who tend to apostatize are regulars but the people who come back to God aren't regulars so I was putting more mental weight on the regulars.	24
1	Without a sense of catholicism (unity), there is no need to go through the intense effort of establishing agreed upon doctrine when you can just join up with like-minded folks who believe just like you do. There is no one answer, historically, because each schism deals with different issues in different times in different contexts.	24
1	Well, I'm inclined to agree with you ;) But, you have to understand that there is a snowball effect. When your church is the product of one, maybe two schisms, you can make a decent effort to maintain a unity of doctrine through tradition and the apostolic succession.   But the protestant reformation established a precedent where not all doctrine could be determined by tradition, and in the many arguments that followed, apostolic succession became obscured and then irrelevant for churches that were trying to establish their doctrine based off reason.	24
1	Seeing your flair, if we were sitting together and someone asked us the role of the Bishop of Rome, you and I would have different answers and would be able to back up those answers. So you think you are right and I think I am right, we now have two different denominations... and we're not even to the reformation.	24
1	I don't know how it is in England, but here in the U.S. it sounds like it would make a mess of family law. Child custody, divorce, common property, inheritance... disputes are messy enough with just two people. It would probably require a major legal overhaul to even think about doing this.	24
1	Around where I went to high school in California, rosaries *were* a sign of gang activity, plain and simple. It was physically dangerous to wear rosary beads around the neck like a necklace. Some kids in middle school might be trying to be "cool" like their high school-aged siblings, neighbors, etc without knowing the implications and/or consequences of their dress. You could be hurt or even shot for walking around in the wrong parts of town for wearing the wrong color beads. I support the ban. It's sort of sad that it's come to this, but children's safety is at stake.	24
1	Because God promised Abraham *land*, *posterity*, and *centrality*. The land was got, the posterity was myriad, and we date history by Christ.  The choice had nothing really to do *with Jews or their qualities*; it was that promise.	24
1	Christianity actually led me to not vote at all. I find that anarcho-pacifism is the natural conclusion to draw from Jesus's teachings. We are not called to use coercion to spread Christian morality, and I don't think it'd be particularly pragmatic to do so either.	24
1	For those who find Marian devotion uncomfortable, maybe consider joining in with [The Novena of Divine Mercy] (http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/mercy/novena.htm) in which [the Chaplet] (http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/mercy/dmmap.htm) is more directly towards Christ:  "Eternal Father, I offer You the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your dearly beloved Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world."	24
1	For many, many years I was an "internet paladin" and obsessed over culture wars and doing God's vengeance for him. More and more I've become convinced that it's important that our Christian "character class" not be paladin, but something else like monk, missionary, gardener, laborer, teacher, cartographer, translator, writer, etc.	24
1	&gt; no woman actually wants an abortion  There's a difference between wanting and needing. No woman skips to the abortion clinic singing, "Fa la la! I get to kill a baby today!" But when a woman needs an abortion, it's like an animal caught in a trap chewing it's own leg off. Desperation.	24
1	The disagreements between everyone. I'm glad this place is full of people that disagree with me on lots of different things. It gives me an opportunity to refine my thought, to learn what others think, and how I can better communicate my ideas. The community isn't a monolith, and someone who I just got done arguing against in a thread can be someone on "my side" of a different issue in a new thread.   The amount of support that's offered through prayer requests and advice is amazing as well.	24
1	I want us to all be one as well.  But it won't happen until we all stop making sweeping statements like:  &gt;They switch for emotional reasons not because it is the true Church  &gt;The best Protestants become Orthodox/Catholic.	24
1	You can find just about any level of crazy on Youtube. My particular favorite is Nuwaubu and the "Melanin Theory" racist pseudoscience ones. It's so refreshing to encounter racism as a white person.	24
1	Don't believe everything that you watch on YouTube.	24
1	I have had meaningful interactions about faith here with people who I would never have met offline. Plus I have a captive audience for talking about gayness and monasticism.	24
1	Furthermore, the fact that we can usually disagree and discuss politely.	24
1	False paradigm. Both instances can be wrong.	24
1	See, that's the thing with religious liberty arguments.   They apply to everyone, not just Christians.	24
1	Personally, I believe that if you want to dismantle abortion, come out and just say so. But don't give me this disingenuous bullshit about waiting periods, or ambulatory surgerical centers, or transvaginal ultrasounds. That's not banning abortion, that's just screwing over poor people.  If you are pro-life, be pro-that-kid's-entire-life. It's bullshit to ban abortion with one hand and then take away childcare benefits and slash education budgets with the other.	24
1	The stories of converts who found Christ.	24
1	Which is rather like saying religious people are prone to violence and pointing at ISIS as proof.	24
1	Also, the people who do neither don't feel the need to make a post titled "just an FYI, still a Christian."	24
1	&gt; of the original arguments against the gay lifestyle that it requires approval of pedophiles. This case of the major, who admitted to a crime, sadly proves that point is far more true that many might want to admit.  Lay your logic out for me. I don't follow.	24
1	I mean, generally, yeah, people who violate the law will face legal punishment, while people who don't won't.	24
1	*"And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it."*   Say what you will, but the church is and must be the bride of Christ.	24
1	So many people here look at hard questions and flatly say that they dont know the answer or they can understand why the answer they give wont make sense from a secular point of view. One example is the infanticide thread from a few days ago.  Yall being honest like that is one of the things that keep me reading.	24
1	It's odd how people pretend the bakers didnt break the law or dont deserve punishment	24
1	LOL, isn't this an amazing trip?  It has made me an uber liberal, and I was as Republican as one could fine.	24
1	&gt;Over at Slate, Amanda Marcotte thinks it’s absolutely hilarious that Satanists are challenging abortion restrictions on religious liberty grounds, seeking to expand abortion access.   well, yeah, it is fucking hilarious. It's adorable when conservatives push through this legislation with the intention of giving Christians special privileges only to see it backfire.  Reminds me of that one state that had religious school vouchers until a Muslim private school applied to the program.	24
1	In my denomination there is a variety of opinions, but we all hold hard and fast to the fact that Jesus' first earthly miracle was an open bar. Also Katie Luther was well known as a brewmaster.	24
1	From the LCMS FAQ:   Q:  What is the LCMS view on the consumption of alcohol?  A:  The Bible nowhere condemns the proper and responsible use (consumption) of alcoholic beverages, and neither does The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod. Scripture does warn strongly and repeatedly against the abuse, misuse or excessive use of alcoholic beverages, and the Missouri Synod has also repeatedly warned against such dangers.  I personally don't drink, because I can't drink without abusing it.	24
1	It's producing, as a culture, this self-awareness of our imperfections that keep us humble and open to learning and growth.  Even in a liberal community like this, I see this heightened sensitivity of the perfection of God, the fallenness of man, and the resultant humility and grace as we reach out for God's ever-present love.  It's beautiful what awareness of our faults can produce in people and in society.	24
1	Well, I don't agree with full on prohibition today, but if you have a moment, check out Ken Burns documentary on the prohibition. Its easy to sympathize with the church's condemnation of alcohol when you see how bad things really got. It may not have been the perfect answer, but it helped move us toward a stance today which is decent, if imperfect.	24
1	God turned water into wine when the wedding party ran out of wine. There is certainly a place for it in religious life.	24
1	How does sleeping with an 18 y.o. make someone a "sex predator".	24
1	I would like an explaination as well.	24
1	Its a compulsion thing. No matter how much you drink it will never be enough. You want the feeling of being drunk and numb, and you want it to be even better than the last time. You're afraid the feeling will go away if you don't keep drinking.  I used to get off work and fill a big soda fountain cup (52oz) with box wine and drink it all and chase it with beers till I passed out.	24
1	The diversity of opinions.	24
1	&gt; For many, many years I was an "internet paladin"  I, too, was addicted to WoW...	24
1	It was also the best wine. Seriously, who brings out the best wine at the end?	24
1	In Washington  you are not allowed to discriminate based on disabilities, service animals, hiv/aids, race, creed, color, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or **sexual orientation** or gender identity. By refusing service the bakers did just that.	24
1	&gt;who admitted to a crime  The article says he claims the relationship didn't become sexual until  Beau was 18. We're free of course to speculate and say this is not the case.	24
1	&gt; Except that you have the whole lgbt community supporting a pedophile.   Um,  &gt;In January 2009, just as Willamette Week is about to break the story, Adams finally admits that, yes, he had a sexual relationship with Breedlove and, yes, he lied about it aggressively. **Adams insists the sexual relationship didn’t begin until the summer of 2005, after he presented himself to Breedlove’s family as a role model at the 18th-birthday party in June.**  Having sex with an 18-year old isn't pedophilia.	24
1	Dude your own article doesn't support your claim that they had sex when he was 17...	24
1	Adams claims he did not have a sexual relationship with the boy until he turned eighteen. Do you have any concrete evidence to the contrary?	24
1	&gt; 17 years old. Underage. Pedophilia.  -  &gt;Pedophilia or paedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children, generally age 11 years or younger.	24
1	UPDATE: All good guys. +++	24
1	&gt; original arguments against the gay lifestyle that it requires approval of pedophiles.  What...?	24
1	Of course, the results of higher criticism is a common refrain in such debates.	24
1	What would prompt an investigation? We don't go around investigating every 40-something-year-old who admits to having sex with an 18-year-old.	24
1	Why would we have an investigation? There aren't any allegations or indications of criminal misconduct.	24
1	There was no investigation needed. He broke no laws. Its the same reason why Tyga wont be investigated in a couple months.	24
1	You may want to like put pedophilia into the googles. Wikipedia says it's a person attracted to prepubescent children...I don't know which 17 year old anyone would call prepubescent. You should be precise with your language as to not imply things that aren't true. Even if he had sex with an underage person, which would be wrong, that doesn't equate to pedophilia.	24
1	http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/34pxgn/how_can_i_love_a_god_that_told_people_to_kill/  Apparently he took this really hard.	24
1	The fact I haven't been banned :P	24
1	We're watching you baby-eater!  /s	24
1	Hey now, let's not bring facts into the conversation.	24
1	I'm 7 years sober from WoW. 9 years from RuneScape. They were dark times in my lives but I'm clean now.  Although, I have been hearing about 2007 RuneScape a bit recently...	24
1	THIS IS THE NO FACTS ZONE. IF THERE ARE FACTS THEN I WILL SELECTIVELY MANIPULATE THEM UNTIL THEY FIT MY AGENDA  /s	24
1	&gt; This "New tolerance" is a big lie by the author.  and OP is his target audience. Effective as shit	24
1	I love how they were crazy enough to make me mod.	24
1	We can arrange that.	24
1	1) Age of consent laws vary by state, in many states 17 years old can consent.  2) You are clearly ignorant of the definition of pedophilia, I suggest you look it up so you don't continue to embarrass yourself.  3) You are clearly only trying to scream  (falsely) about pedophilia to smear all gay people.  Does the reverse apply, can we smear all of the christians in your particular sect because of what one person does.  Let's play that game shall we?  4) Thankfully your vain smearing of all gay people exposes your true anti gay agenda.  Thanks for that.	24
1	The OP is not interested in facts, he is just trying to smear all gay people with the usual pedo = gay lies.	24
1	This is not about an assault on adult freedom. Middle schoolers are children. They are not fully mentally developed to make rational choices and are the school's responsibility. Wearing local gang-affiliated attire of any sort poses a danger to the student who wears it and to those around him.	24
1	Don't be pedantic. My point stands.	24
1	RandallHerman.com is returning 503 and his twitter hasn't been updated since Feb 13th.  I can't help but think this was a publicity stunt, because never, in a billion years, would I have otherwise ended up at his imdb page.	24
1	I've said this before, and I think people thought I was kidding, but I love the fact that new contributors who happen to also be atheists almost always phrase question posts along the lines of "Friendly atheist here with an honest question," without even being coached to phrase it that way. Also, I like those threads themselves.	24
1	I'm not sure you have been following the news. He will probably get thousands from anonymous donors for this.	24
1	I'm a gay guy who's very seriously looking into joining a monastery. First step is to visit, which will happen in July.	24
1	While we try to welcome people of all kinds here, I'm not sure this is an appropriate place to be broadcasting your gang affiliations.	24
1	How is Atheists questioning the validity of our holy text not relevant to the discussion?	24
1	Paladin - a medieval Christian knight of Charlamagne's court and defender of the faith.  My wife went to Furman University, who's sports teams are named the Paladins. So for those of you keeping score at home, that would be the Furman University Christian Knights.  Always fun to spell out at football games.	24
1	I guess I'm not sure what the point of the post is. Are you explaining why you don't think Christian atheism is a tenable position, or why you think Christianity, if its tenets are true, is a better moral choice for the world than atheism? I see both of these ideas here, but I'm not sure which is the *main* point, and either way, one distracts from the other.	24
1	The church has shifted on other social issues such as slavery, why would they not shift on abortion or same-sex marriage?	24
1	The authenticity and steadfastness of the transmission of a document says nothing of their content as reliably accurate history.	24
1	Man, I was worried we'd have a whole thread where we didn't discuss gay marriage.  Thank goodness for you!	24
1	There are times....small intermittant times when I wonder if associating myself with Christianity is worth it. This is one of those times.	24
1	Im not your buddy, guy!	24
1	Well that escalated quickly.	24
1	&gt;"bride" literally means the thing you fuck.  Not the best analysis I've ever heard. Were you trying to go etymological? If so, you're [incorrect](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bride).	24
1	As trans and lesbian, my murder would be worth a lot of points in this game.  And I *beg* you not to give bastards like this the satisfaction of claiming exclusive ownership of Christ's name.  Also, I'm not leaving, so don't leave me alone in here with him and his buddies.	24
1	Alright then. Push on, push on.	24
1	&gt; then you might as well go with some religion and feel a bit of peace  sure but you shouldn't use it as an excuse to hate.   Your ignorance is also showing when you say atheists follow a specific belief system. You throw around the word and apply a meaning that has nothing to do with it  &gt; Well, then that is delusional and shouldn't happen. That is like following the wise words of Spongebob or Captain America.  Wait you are saying following a god is delusional? Im confused as fuck now.	24
1	&gt;Literally means  Trying to understand what the heck context you drew that from.	24
1	&gt; How well do you feel your position is being represented in the Federal Government?   I'm not sure what you mean by that or the next question. Do you mean to say 'do you think you have a voice' or is it the government is adhering to what I think the country should be run like?	24
1	One of my theological points is LISTS. List of places God cannot be.  BLANK. List of people God cannot save.  BLANK. List of times God is not present.  BLANK.   How powerful is God?  List is infinite.	24
1	&gt; Considering Florida does not allow Catholics ... to vote  Wait, ***wat!?*** I have Catholic friends in Florida. They can vote.   &gt; (Or anyone else who holds the constitution***s*** to be indefensible)  Unh...which constitution***s***!?  EDIT: Also indefensible...how exactly??  EDIT2: [This should be interesting](http://i.imgur.com/0hQyd5L.gifv).	24
1	&gt; Jesus turned 180 gallons of water into wine.  ...and served it to people who were already a bit drunk.  "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now."	24
1	I prefer family guys take on it  "Of course I love you. I just can't stand your freakin' guts."	24
1	If you define love as just a stronger emotion than like, then yeah - it's nonsense.  But love in the Biblical sense doesn't seem to be rooted in the emotions or the affections, but rather in the decision-making parts.  The love concept in the OT was centered around covenant-making and marriage, and both of these were long-term decisions to act loyally for another.    So I think it's legitimate to love someone (i.e. to make a decision to favor someone or act sacrifically on their behalf), but not like them (i.e. not want them as a close friend).	24
1	What do you mean by "believe just in Jesus"? I believ  Jesus was a real dude, but I don't believe he was divine.	24
1	Excellent points.  What OP *really* needs from his church is a punch in the face.	24
1	Sorry, the other poster was criticizing your post because, in their view, you're saying you only want a church that makes you feel comfortable - lets you do bad stuff and not feel bad about it. But in your post, you didn't say that, you said you don't like crowds and awkward social interaction.  And I get annoyed when people confuse the first one for the second one.	24
1	Oh, I see. You were saying that as a joke. Sorry, haha. I was a bit confused there for a second. You are correct in your interpretation of what I said.	24
1	Why didn't Jesus fulfill any of the messianic prophecies?	24
1	I like how all of your answers are non answers	24
1	Have you looked on craigslist?  I found my wife, sailboat, and kayak on craigslist	24
1	Douthat came across as quite cool, collected, and eloquent. Frustratingly, Maher's standard response seems to be "pejorative zinger, let's move on". I don't know if they stayed on any one topic long enough to say that either won, but I would certainly rather hang out with Douthat.	24
1	For many, IVF is the only way they can have children.	24
1	But does necessity make it right? I'm not so sure that the end justifies the means in this case.	24
1	You would deny a person the right to reproduce?	24
1	&gt;It is taking it out of Gods hands  I believe we take alot of things outside of Gods hands.	24
1	Yes. Unless you are going to go back to the ideas of "some inferior people arent fit to reproduce".	24
1	Count me as one who, despite being about ten zillion light-years from being his fan politically, is still very glad that he received rescue from alcoholism through Christ.	24
1	This video is pretty bad. Stephen was indeed just bringing up the problem of suffering, which is obviously a common argument against christianity. If an all loving god exists why is there so much needless suffering in this world, its a pretty straightforward argument; I fail to see what so nonsensical about it	24
1	This is not the same as not being able to smoke weed, or not being allowed to drink in the street. This is a persons *lineage*. Reproduction is one of the two proven meanings of life on this planet. Denying them that oppertunity would be immoral.   &gt;Maybe God isnt calling them to have children  You might as well say you maybe shouldnt give a sick man medicine as "maybe God isnt calling them to live."	24
1	Do you believe it is a persons right to keep themselves alive artificially? Correct their ailments artificially?	24
1	No, I'm saying that the countless instances of needless human and animal suffering in this world isn't what we should expect to be the case if an all loving being actually created this world	24
1	Stephen Fry does not say that a god cannot exist because there is suffering. His point follows the problem of evil:   Is god willing to prevent suffering, but unable? Then god is not omnipotent.   Is god able to prevent suffering, but not willing? Then god is malevolent.   Is god willing and able to prevent suffering? Then why is there suffering?   Is god neither willing nor able to prevent suffering? Then why call him god?	24
1	There is nothing in the historical record to suggest that Jesus masturbated.	24
1	The concept you're referring to is called moral luck. Because of this, it's led some Christians (myself included) to believe in universal reconciliation. Richard Beck has a good write-up about it [here](http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2006/10/why-i-am-universalist-part-4-moral.html). I think it goes without saying that this is a minority opinion amongst Christians, though.	24
1	Of course the Church weeps over its division.	24
1	Hi! I'm gay, 24 and I live in Seattle. I'd love to talk further - please feel free to PM me.	24
1	Probably not many, but there was at least one guy who put "On April 19th, I made bread" on a wall.  It's my favorite piece of Roman graffiti.	24
1	In the interview, she makes it clear that she did not get pregnant just so that she could get an abortion. I watched the entire video you posted and she did not use the word parasite either. Her intention, from what I could gather, was that she wanted to reduce the stigma surrounding abortion and reassure women that it's not necessarily a scary experience. Do I agree with her approach? Not necessarily but misrepresenting her is unfair and makes you look deceitful.	24
1	I view when a fetus develops a brain, it is "off limits" before it has a brain, it is simply a shell. In addition, embyos can be lost through natural means, it seems silly to punish someone over something that could happen of natural causes.	24
1	Our brain houses our conciousness. Whether you are religious are not, we know that for a fact. Due to the belief that souls are a form of our conciousness, it stands to reason that they are imparted, or generated when the human develops a brain. After all, you dont view losing your arm as losing part of your soul, however, when your brain dies, it is generally accepted your soul has moved on.	24
1	It's amoral at worst. People don't realize that fetuses are lost naturally literally all the time. It's exceptionally common.	24
1	What things are you worried about in particular? Are there any aspects of the bible you can't come to terms with?	24
1	For the Orthodox, that is where it ends, typically. Communion can only happen once there is unity, not as a step on the way to unity.	24
1	Roger that. Praying.	24
1	You've got it. May God give you strength to overcome the obstacles of this world, and the peace that surpasses all our understanding.  If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm always here and you can always post here for support. I hope things get easier for you.	24
1	If one can't find a few thousand dollars in 5 months for a car one desperately needs, I am more worried about his financial situation than his car-lessness. :/   Praying for him to receive whatever it is that he needs.	24
1	Well the Bible would say that, right?	24
1	ITT:  The true church lacks a shift key.	24
1	I have been there, my friend. Still got my foot in the waters a bit. Remember what God said to Paul: "My strength is made perfect in weakness."	24
1	I too believe in universal reconciliation.  One of Christ's last words were "Father, forgive them *for they know not what they do*".  Not, "Forgive them because they believe in me." or "Forgive them because they are fundamentally good people".  The mob certainly had ample opportunity to know Jesus - heck, he was walking among them for years.  And yet they were forgiven, without them even asking for it, because they were completely unaware they were sinning.  That same love and mercy extends today, for all people.  Now matter where you were born, who your parents are, or what you have done.	24
1	&gt; The Bible is clear that there is enough evidence and that anyone who says otherwise is suppressing the truth.  It would be nice if someone would actually ***say what this evidence is*** instead of always just claiming it exists.	24
1	Dark suit, white shirt, and no.	24
1	No wool and linen.	24
1	And also it is *not* nice when someone's position is basically I believe there is enough evidence, I believe you know there is enough evidence, so I believe you are lying when you say there is not enough evidence and do not believe. You really do not get anywhere when the basis of your argument is every that does not agree is intentionally lying.	24
1	Can't wear a stole unless you're ordained.	24
1	That's awesome!  Now what?	24
1	Clothes are definitely required.	24
1	Well the first thing I will do is enjoy tomorrow.  Whatever tomorrow brings, I will be sure to enjoy it. I've spent so many days just watching them pass by. Literally, day after day of doing absolutely nothing.  I might just walk around the block tomorrow. Talk to a stranger. Anything besides stay locked up in this house.  I've had enough of those days.	24
1	As an atheist? No. You must be converted before you enter New Jerusalem (heaven).	24
1	&gt; Scripture doesn't record every word every person said  That's partly why [Tradition](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15006b.htm) is a thing!	24
1	In prayer my friend. We have all been there. It is just a season.	24
1	Is this...a real question?	24
1	"If raichu evolved from pikachu, why are their still pikachus? Checkmate, atheists."	24
1	Woohoo!  That is a great revelation to get.  I think too many of us live in self-condemnation, which is sinful in and of itself.  Who are we to usurp God's place as judge in our lives?	24
1	&gt;Is it in general acceptable for a non-believer to be active in a church?  It should be, you won't be able to participate in some aspects such as the Lord's Supper, but you should be able to attend, talk to people after the service, and go to church events.  &gt;Or would this create undesirable situations?  Most churches would be thrilled to have someone regularly attend. As long as you don't interrupt the service or anything you should be fine.	24
1	Totally! Church is for everybody! In some churches you might not be able to receive the Sacraments, but that doesn't make you less of a member or less important or less welcome in any way.	24
1	My parents had an atheist in their Sunday School class for years because he liked the social justice work they did. Be prepared to be witnessed to and for a few (mostly well meaning) folks to be jerks about it, but for the most part you should be accepted and respected.	24
1	I thought it said "On Topic Tuesday" for a second and I was like, "since when did we get boring?"   I need more coffee.	24
1	It was date day! It was a really fun movie with a really great guy!	24
1	Well, of course I wouldn't interrupt the service ;) , I see no positivity in that. Thanks for replying.	24
1	At the most liberal churches (Episcopalian, UCC, Quaker), they really respect that there are people who don't fully believe, but still see value in Christian traditions and communities and are trying to figure things out.  Our (Methodist) church would also love to see you come but might not be as careful about respecting your non-belief.  Also, every church does a bunch of stuff outside Sunday morning worship.  Joining in for some of the service-to-the-community activities would give you good friendships doing good things without as much awkwardness of deciding whether to pray along with everyone else.	24
1	my kid likes Minor Threat.  I think I win.	24
1	I figured you wouldn't, good luck with finding a church (:	24
1	Have a great day! Don't forget to put on a HUGE SMILE because God is so awesome! I'm glad you have forgiven yourself, may you walk with peace in your journey!	24
1	Agreed, I've been told by otherwise really pleasant folks that I am lying when I say I don't believe that their particular god exists. They seem to be under the impression that "deep down" I actually ***do*** believe and I'm just pretending not to.   It's a really frustrating way to interact with people because there is not really much I can say at that point other than "no... I'm really really not lying about this"	24
1	Well, Jesus *was* a physical man.  My main problem with it is when Jesus has light brunette hair and looks less Jewish than I do.	24
1	I was thinking about a pastrami sandwich for lunch. Pickle, or no pickle?	24
1	I think it's often tacky, but I don't think it's a violation of the second commandment.  Jesus, after all, is the image of the invisible God.  Images can be depicted.  The reason we cannot make an image of God is because God cannot be depicted, and ultimately we are making an idol.	24
1	Well, Barack Obama is already in the White House	24
1	He already rose and fell, and his name was Nero, Emperor of Rome.   Amil Partial Preterist here. ;)	24
1	And Pope Francis is in Rome.  Or is he the Beast? I never can keep those two straight.	24
1	Yeah. I am in Maharashtra, and just had beef fry and parota yesterday.  "Christians in India under siege" - say the Evangelists and the anti-BJP people.   Toxic propaganda.	24
1	It's not so much the accuracy, but what such inaccurate depictions say about ourselves -- to change the truth that was handed to us to make *ourselves* feel more comfortable.  Tradition, including Scripture, speaks clearly that the Lord is Jewish.	24
1	In the Old Testament, God didn't reveal Himself.  However, in the New Testament, God became incarnate as Christ the *man*, and became visible to our eyes.  Remember that the Law is *fulfilled* in Christ.	24
1	Churches *should* have images of Christ. Iconoclasm is a heresy.	24
1	Might be OK if white American Christians didn't have a shameful history of using Christianity to justify suppressing other ethnicities and cultures.  It's a sin we very badly need to repent of, not keep fond mementos from.  We very badly need to remember that Jesus didn't have a drop of European blood.	24
1	Images of Christ are not graven images of false gods. That's what is proscribed.	24
1	&gt; P.S. As a American citizen, it is my duty to hate Obama but love the U.S. Constitution. I'm not even that conservative...  What does that even *mean*?	24
1	Funny thing is, Goan Christians *hate* the evangelists too. Older Christian sects in India hate the new breed of evangelism from America/Australia. They agree with the Hindus that the missionaries are spreading toxic agenda to 'save souls'.   Indian Christians are known for their liberal forward thinking among Indians. However, with this new breed, evangelical Christian organisations are pressurizing on things like "homosexuality is evil; don't go to doctors, Jesus will save you; don't abort". Same crap they do in America and Australia.  Whenever criticized, they spread propaganda with false facts and manufacture outrage.	24
1	Implying that Catholicism and the Pope are the Antichrist is a violation of [Rule 1.3](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/wiki/xp#wiki_bigotry).	24
1	I feel that, in keeping with the canons of the 7th Ecumenical Council, they're advocating for proper Christology.  Christ is fully human and therefore quite depictable.  While Christ is in Heaven at the moment, He did have an earthly, material existence, and that's *incredibly* important.    Saying that it's wrong to depict Christ or the saints is heresy.  (That said, it *is* patently inappropriate to depict God the Father, who has never assumed physical form.)	24
1	The Jews are a Semitic people, i.e. not European, not Asian, not African, not Native American.  So we do know what He did *not* look like.  If Jesus were Japanese, I'm pretty sure such distinctiveness in Jewish society would have been recorded.	24
1	I belong to a church that practices an open communion. Not everyone is restricted from participating at every church.	24
1	True! If you read Rule 1.3, you'll also see examples of wording that would result in a violation of the rule. Calling another the AntiChrist is one of them. If you have any questions about this rule, please don't hesitate to contact us via modmail!	24
1	Probably just the Catholic Church, returning to it's namesake of being universal.  Or if they wanted to give a nod to both, The Orthodox Catholic Church. Or something. I dunno.	24
1	This is getting downvoted, but it's pretty much the major Orthodox belief too-for the schism to end, the Pope would need to step down and enter catechism with the rest of the Catholic church.   This is why we have the issues we have :P	24
1	Methodists have open communion. We believe that "Christ invites all to his table those who earnestly repent of their sin" and invite them for communion. An old pastor of mine used to specifically say that you didn't need to be a member of our or any other church just that you came with a humble heart looking to be clean (or close to that, it's been about ten years).	24
1	Icons of Jesus SHOULD be in the sanctuary. Otherwise you're buying into the iconoclastic heresy.	24
1	The Gospels record Judas' wallowing in self-despair after his betrayal of Christ.  He committed suicide because he couldn't forgive himself.  This mindset is not extreme contrition, but actually extreme pride.  Who are you not to forgive yourself when God's forgiveness is infinite?  Not to forgive yourself is denying God's infinite mercy, and this is what is meant by the unforgivable sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.	24
1	Many churches take membership very seriously. My church would not accept an atheist into membership. Our process is actually similar to the Orthodox process, albeit with a shorter timeline to baptism.	24
1	Sorry, that makes a lot more sense. When we accept someone as a member, its a process that means baptism and being voted in by the congregation (I know, very strange).	24
1	Ohh! Yeah, I agree with that, in the sense of "being a member of the Orthodox Church". I just meant being a member of the community. That's my fault, I probably should have worded it better.	24
1	Stand against the Seventh Ecumenical Council? I wasn't aware that Luther rejected it.	24
1	Admission by baptism I have heard of. Admission by vote, that's new to me. Tell us more, please.	24
1	Well he is elected to run the country for the best interest of all his constituents, not just the ones with his religious beliefs. He should be able to defend his choices to all people in terms they can comprehend.	24
1	I don't care if a politician is religious or if a piece of legislation ultimately derive from religious thinking--what I care about is that the benefits of the legislation should be explainable from a secular/ecumenical perspective, just saying *Deus le veult* is not a valid explaination.	24
1	&gt;A politician who believes in the God of Abraham, however, is important to me.  Why?	24
1	Not all churches number the Ten Commandments in the same way. For Lutherans, we see this as part of the First Commandment about having no other gods but God.	24
1	That happens to me. Theology is not a construction of the written word, it is found in the living Word.  The most interesting theology is done on one's knees or with one's hands. If you've sucked the page dry, turn to God in prayer.   Theology without prayer is like sailing a brick house. Sometimes these dry times are gifts, so we can focus in other areas that may need growth: alms, mercy, prayer, etc. those things that give theology life.	24
1	It's a cute story. I would be interested to hear atheists reations to it.  Of course any analogy has its hits and misses. The main fault of this analogy is probably that Mother's presence is physically manifest, but I guess one might counter with [Romans 1:19-20] or something to the same effect. It would be against the principle of charity to dig into the faults of an analogy anyway.	24
1	Wow. This would be a great Mother's day meditation for Church.	24
1	I'm torn because it was posted by an atheist, but I feel it's uncharitable to atheists.  Is it a trap?  Can we upvote without offending our atheist friends?	24
1	&gt; “Sometimes, when you’re in silence and you focus and you really listen, you can perceive Her presence, and you can ~~hear Her loving voice, calling down from above.~~ *also hear her peeing."*  ^Seriously, ^though, ^cute ^story. ^I ^liked ^it.	24
1	&gt;  Can we upvote without offending our atheist friends?   I upvoted it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯	24
1	I'm so sick of this "debate".  Despite all of the overwhelming evidence showing that they're wrong, antivaxxers continue this fiasco.  At this point I don't think any evidence, article, or debate will convince them otherwise.	24
1	&gt;Nonsense. And moreover if there is life, then why has no one has ever come back from there? Delivery is the end of life,  This is conjuring up some weird images.	24
1	I'm not sure what this really has to do with the post.	24
1	As soon as somebody says they're anti-vaccination, their opinion on just about everything immediately becomes worthless to me.  I'll listen to capitalists, STEMjerkers, rabid hyperCalvinists and even crackpot conspiracy theorists -- but not anti-vaxxers.	24
1	&gt;they the homosexuals know it is a sin to live a life of homosexuality. Why else would they have been hiding in the closet(?)"  So they won't get sued, apparently.	24
1	BUT THE FDA IS BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY BIG PHARMA  Seriously I'm as distrustful of the government and corporations as the next person, but there are plenty of pragmatic and even CYNICAL reasons not to think the FDA is lying about vaccines.	24
1	Why did the early church start underground?   People need to understand their own history, at least.	24
1	She sounds like she might be mentally ill. She thinks she's God's ambassador on earth, and seems to think US district courts are in a position to rule on religious questions.	24
1	If you're afraid of mercury, stop eating fish then.	24
1	Your link also says that most vaccines no longer have Thimerosol, and the ones that do only contain trace amounts.	24
1	&gt;not anti-vaxxers  For clarification, does this include those who aren't against all vaccines but take skeptical views towards new vaccines or ones that may use various preservatives that are questionable?	24
1	There is a really good vaccine video that explains there is far more mercury in many of the other things we consume than in our vaccine. I'll look for it.	24
1	In theory, no.  In practice, I've never met anybody who ***actually knew about the science of it*** who held such skeptical views, which to me puts said skeptics on much the same level as climate-change deniers, or non-biologists disputing evolutionary theory. AKA a little less egregious, but not really in a useful way.	24
1	Christianity provides no real promise of reward for good deeds at all. Good works are fruit of love, not things done to gain a prize.  Christian ethics, in many respects, resemble a "virtue ethics" system. Good deeds are not prized for themselves, nor are bad deeds bad for themselves. That's how Jesus can accuse those who lust after someone of adultery and condemn the Pharisees as hypocrites, because they are doing their good deeds in order to be seen by others. Why you do something is more important than what you do.	24
1	And the LORD said, "FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM UPON WHICH RELIEF CAN BE GRANTED."	24
1	Your honor I can't help but think this woman is guilty. Guilty of being a stupid waste of our time.	24
1	No lawyer who actually passed Civil Procedure I would take this kind of "claim" seriously. It would be an open invitation for the court to slap them down for filing a frivolous lawsuit.	24
1	The only vaccines given to children under 6 (ie: those that antivaxxers still falsely claim will cause autism) in the US which still contain trace amounts of Thiomersal are flu vaccines. Even that amount is vanishingly small. In addition, everything on the list you provided comes in a form without mercury.  Anti-vaxxers are anti-vaxxers because they value emotion and fear over and above logic, statistics, and facts. This is fine if you don't want to eat gluten. It is not okay when you want to give my kids the measles.	24
1	Yes, I realize this is not about Christianity itself, but it is an attack on religious values in the area.  So I felt it'd be a fair post here.  I compare this to being told by the government that we have to bow down to statues of the current emperor.	24
1	You know what's in salt? [Sodium.](https://youtu.be/NTFBXJ3Zd_4?t=48)  and [Chlorine, a deadly gas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine)  WAKE UP SHEEPLE. Chemistry works differently than you think.	24
1	I can't imagine any federal judge who would let a claim like this proceed. There is no legitimate claim she could possibly be making for relief.  I'd also love to see who she thinks the court has personal jurisdiction over for this.  I want to read the complaint just for the lulz.	24
1	DIHYDROGEN MONOXIDE KILLS!  WAKE UP SHEEPLE!	24
1	&gt;Hi, I'm one of those Crazy people who believe the genesis account of creation in seven days.  Heretic!  It was SIX days.	24
1	Posters around here are usually OEC or accept evolution. You will probably find like minds in /r/TrueChristian and /r/Creation.	24
1	Strange and unproductive? Anti-vaxxers are among the most credulous and ill-informed of fringe group yahoos. They literally believe vaccines cause autism in spite of there being absolutely no credible medical evidence of this whatsoever. The religious ones harbor the most bizarre misinterpretations of Scripture this side of the British Israel movement.   It's like talking to people who believe in evil government chemtrails.	24
1	I think it belongs in this sub.  The current Chinese government has a history of attacking Christians too	24
1	That reason is because people like you complained, not because it is actually dangerous.	24
1	[Herd Immunity](https://youtu.be/ZuiHFg_nfnE)  This isn't about mercury, but it's a really good video about herd immunities.	24
1	Thank you for subscribing to /r/CabbagetrollFacts	24
1	Yeah, especially in context to the resurrection, but I guess that same imagery was given in scripture: "who can return to the womb to be born a second time?" or something like that.	24
1	[Would you like to know more?](https://doughboytoironman.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/nph-know-more.jpg) Then [click here](http://www.dhmo.org/truth/Dihydrogen-Monoxide.html)	24
1	Pennoyer made no sense at all.     Hayes was inscrutable scrawl.   But I hit the bricks   at rule 12(b)(6).   Civ Pro's a kick in the Iqbals.	24
1	And if these Evangelicals actually know of the theology of Bonhoeffer, some of them would have thrown him into a gas oven instead.	24
1	To clarify - in a church like Bremstralung's, an atheist would of course be welcome to come to church, hang out with members, go to community groups, etc. But membership entails certain rights and responsibilities that are only open to those who agree with the statement of faith in at least broad strokes, and make a committment to the church and other members therein.	24
1	"I'm like Bonhoeffer" strongly implies "You're like Hitler".  Godwin's Law, everybody, Godwin's Law.  But then, I'm trans, so apparently I *am* the enemy plotting genocidal murder of Christians (including myself? - not clear on that).	24
1	Faith is necessary but not sufficient.  Protestants believe that faith is sufficient, but this is actually a novel teaching in the history of Christianity.	24
1	OP isn't looking for confirmation bias-he's not asking if what he believes is correct. He's asking if anyone else here agrees.	24
1	In the original language you cannot make that interpretation.  But even in our English version you have to read that scripture in concert with the flat command to give the thief your cloak when he steals your coat, right?  And all those other commands to to be meek and humble and to turn your other cheek also when offended.	24
1	And if these Evangelicals actually know of the theology of Bonhoeffer, some of them would have thrown him into a gas oven instead.	24
1	&gt; It's like talking to people who believe in evil government chemtrails.  Oh, man, the first time I met someone who believed the chemtrail thing I thought it was a joke and things got awkward fast...	24
1	And your creating a false either or choice.  The evangelical leaders are claiming Bonhoeffer in concert with making the assertion that we are on the verge of Nazi like persecution of Christians if gays get marriage.  This is going to rebound against the faith when the passions cool.  Nobody is going to kick in the doors of my family and drag them off to camps if the Court gives gays access to marriage.	24
1	&gt; My initial reaction to it is that it's very fortunate for baby 2 that he guessed everything exactly right with no way of knowing.  The story was kind of constructed to make baby 2 the "reasonable one" of the two, since of course Mother "intervenes" in the womb in a much more obvious way than God intervenes in our world, with the voice and all that, but I get your point.  Thank you for your perspective.	24
1	Your comment is in violation of [Rule 1.3](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/wiki/xp#wiki_bigotry).	24
1	I think there are a lot of people out there who still see gay people as de-facto atheists or anti-theists and probably would have difficulty even understanding the concept of a gay person being a Christian.	24
1	SWAT teams and hostage negotiators are on site, where the suspect is reportedly holding 247 million captives.  Suspect is described as being heavily armed and emotionally disturbed, but fabulously dressed.	24
1	Basically, I live on the banks of the Tiber, but haven't crossed yet. I rather like the Episcopal Church, "between Rome and Reform", but as a traditionalist, I am having a hard time pursuing orthodoxy within.	24
1	In other news, afternoon tea nearly spit all over keyboards.  Back to you for weather.	24
1	The op is looking for support from the community. Please don't discourage people seeking support.	24
1	Yeah, I can see why that didn't work out.	24
1	Or maybe the people at the wedding got drunk but didn't sin?	24
1	I find it hard to believe there were no drunk people at a party.	24
1	I hope that she can fight this. I know that the original intent of the law is technically to make sure the food is safe, but it is pretty clearly an attempt to at least move the homeless population away from the areas and make it someone else's problem, if not something worse.	24
1	Don't forget to scream about how she is being "persecuted" because she can't sue all the homosexuals.  Add another one to your "persecution" file.	24
1	Ugh... why my state..	24
1	If you are in the NYC area, I'd recommend checking out Redeemer Presbyterian. Very smart, rational church.  You can check out more info and sermons here: http://www.redeemer.com/	24
1	1. Traditional catholic, of course 2. Non-denominational 3. Evangelical megachurch 4. Lutheran 5. Presbyterian 6. small black gospel church (my favorite) 7. baptist 8. pentecostal/holiness 9. anglican 10. methodist 11. eastern orthodox 12. adventist	24
1	I would knock off one of the bottom two and add E. Orthodox.	24
1	I said this in another comment, and I should have put it in the original post, but I already have pretty extensive experience with the Mormon faith. I have family who are Mormon. It's not a church I'm going to explore, as I already know a good bit about it, have attended multiple times, etc. They're nice people though!  Be honest, are Jehovah's Witnesses as scary and intense as a lot of people make them sound?	24
1	...  I really think he should include Orthodoxy. I mean Messianic Judaism is nice and all, but if one wants to have a complete picture of Christianity, to ignore the original Church would be deeply misguided.	24
1	&gt;...to ignore the original Church would be deeply misguided.  Pretty sure Baptist is on the list.	24
1	Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1879, or Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1912?	24
1	Living in the United State, a Stone-Campbell church should be on the list.  It could be Independant Christian Church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) or Church of Christ. There are more of us out there than people realize.	24
1	Bro, Catholic is the first on the list ;P	24
1	I was waiting for that one haha	24
1	Yeah, children's parties.   Anyway, what I meant was that I find it hard to believe that at a party where they ran out of alcohol and wanted more, that there were no drunks.	24
1	DIE HERETIC!!!!	24
1	&gt;Bonhoeffer was, himself, an evangelical protestant Christian rooted in Scripture.   Evangelical means something entirely different within Bonhoeffer's context and shouldn't be confused with modern, American "evangelicals." Evangelical is a term that the Lutheran church in Germany was using for centuries and has nothing to do with Evangelicalism in America.	24
1	It's just bizarre that accrediting bodies and the NCAA tolerate this sort of nonsense. Here's to hoping those organizations set higher ethical standards for member institutions.	24
1	This is a great list, but it would be a shame to leave out a pacifist denomination like Mennonite (Brethern) or Quaker.  (Are Adventists pacifist? - not sure, but in any case they wouldn't be a good replacement.)  But I don't know which of your list to bump!  OP, can you insert an extra month?	24
1	Hah, I'd eat my hat if Ken Ham endorsed something as "heretical" as Gap Theory.	24
1	FWIW: Most conservative denominations don't even regard Mormons and Jehovah Witnesses as actual Christians.  It's also worth noting that most of the church denominations have internal splits between conservative and liberal. Great example can be seen in Presbyterian churches, where the PCA is a fast growing, young, conservative group and the PC(USA) is a slow dying, liberal group. Might want to mix it up between the two because the differences can be even wider within denominations than between them.	24
1	But wait til around Easter time for the E. Orthodox, because Easter midnight Mass is *great* in a Russian Orthodox service.	24
1	&gt; [but haven't crossed yet](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/49/49ded2238ba4eaaca94bf22f509c13db3e7699d8a1934664cd942a491650b05f.jpg)	24
1	You do realize that your argument here bears absolutely no resemblance to the one made in these cases?	24
1	The bakers/pizza shop owners/etc didnt have a problem with *feeding* gay people. They had an issue with catering a gay wedding. Regardless of what I think about the legitimacy of their claims, you realize thats two entirely different things, right?	24
1	No Jesus would go to the wedding, and he would show them the error of their ways.  Remember that Jesus hung out with the scum of the earth, prostitutes, tax collectors, adulterors.	24
1	I thought it was worth pointing out that you had nearly doubled the number you were quoting. Most people wouldn't do that unless they thought the number mattered.	24
1	It's not feed gay people, it's participating in a gay wedding that's the issue.	24
1	No one, literally no one, has stated that they are refusing to feed homosexuals. What they are doing is refusing to participate in a specific kind of ceremony that celebrates an action (homosexual unions) that we believe to be sinful. The difference should be clear.   Edit: Word Mix Up	24
1	I second the Quaker addition! Its a very different setting for sure.	24
1	My position is that your argument is not cogent.	24
1	The gospel (and salvation) is not about bad people being made good, it is about dead people being made alive. Let this resonate with you on the spiritual front, and i hope this helps you in your thoughts on this.   My other advice is, find a therapist; i've had many friends from all over the mental disorder spectrum, some who have been in rehab and others who have just had their disorders annoy them greatly. But you need a professional to help you on this one. I'll pray for your peace, love and understanding, my friend.	24
1	What if all homosexuals were ordered to call or stop by her house and apologize and for the rest of her life she just had a line of gay people outside her house waiting for their turn.	24
1	Where does it lack cogency?	24
1	Jesus fed people who were following him listening to him preach. That's not exactly a gay wedding.	24
1	I don't know, but that doesn't have anything to do with his feeding miracles.	24
1	Really? I dont see that anywhere here-can you quote where youve said that to me?	24
1	Your title confuses me :/	24
1	I just realized that my title was worded horribly... Sorry about that :/	24
1	I usually hate posting, I just browse through looking at threads.	24
1	It doesn't bug me. They think what they think, I'll think what I think. All I can do is love my neighbours as myself.	24
1	You have a great day/night, too.	24
1	One, /r/atheism used to be default sub, so like everyone would go there. Two, atheists are a minority out in the world of religious people who use their privilege to make laws and push their religion in schools or public offices. Atheists need somewhere to vent and share ideas and share how they feel, so /r/atheism is that place. We can't just go up to our moms, bosses, friends, etc and tell them our honest opinion about the concepts they believe. If you don't like it there, by all means, you don't have to go there.	24
1	I think the big difference is that atheism is just a lack of a belief about deities.  So there really isn't much to talk about.  That means only the most extreme people will go out of their way to talk there.	24
1	This shouldn't even be about religion at all. Making it a crime to feed another person shows just how little the government cares about us.	24
1	I think I probably wouldnt post to a sub that is for my religious beliefs if I didnt agree with the tone too.	24
1	I think thats OP's point. He wishes he could be a part of it, but he isnt really so down with the overall tone of it.  At least thats what I'm getting from his post.	24
1	Or the marginalised. However, I do agree with you, talking about what you *dont* believe is not likely to end in productive conversation.	24
1	I just kind of figured it was a joke. Like, "Oh, man, harsh setup, this guy's gonna be a dou--oh, how nice! Hah, you got me there, Mr. Nice Atheist!" :-)	24
1	It totally worked on me, probably best to pretend it was on purpose :)	24
1	/r/trueatheism typically has a lot less of what you described.	24
1	So if a Muslim or an atheist comes into my house and I show them hospitality and care for them, making them feel so comfortable and happy in a Christian home that they tell their friends about it, I can expect Jesus to be angry with me?	24
1	I don't want to hate anybody.	24
1	Well there is always r/trueatheism	24
1	A "one time thing"? Seriously? I'm pretty sure we're supposed to love our neighbors more than just that one time.	24
1	If that's what you believe, then you don't really follow Jesus' example or teaching, since He taught (and modeled) resurrection.	24
1	Most believe it's an attempt to get the homeless out of the down town area.	24
1	Men will hate you, sure. That doesnt mean "make sure men hate you." We should always act with love-and sometimes it is received well, sometimes it isnt. Others reactions arent the gauge by which we should be measuring our Christian lives.	24
1	"People will hate you" certainly doesn't mean "everyone will hate you."	24
1	You mean slightly less. Lets not kid ourselves here. Most threads there are a few voices of reason, and hordes of crazy people insisting that its really important to think Jesus never even existed, but not quite able to explain why him existing alone puts christianity at risk of being true. The people there aren't much better, its just that there's less memes, and they're at least trying to be serious.	24
1	&gt; Sort of. The Nazis persecuted not only European Jewry, but also many other ethnic groups and those found to be spreading dissent.   And you know, homosexuals.	24
1	The respect given on this subreddit is the the only reason I'm subscribed to it. The lack of respect on r/atheism is why I avoid it like the plague.	24
1	Just because doing some good things makes people disliked doesn't mean that they can use being disliked as a metric that they're doing good things. In this day and age the reality is that many christians are simply unrepentantly bad, and use religion as an excuse, or for certain kinds of badness don't even bother tying it to religion, but think that being religious is a get out of jail free card. The dislike Jesus was warning about is not the dislike you know of now.	24
1	Youre making a point that we should be concerned that we arent christian enough because a select number of heterodox people that come here arent angry with us and dont hate us. That seems to me that youre advocating for Christians to purposely cause hate, because that makes us Christian.	24
1	Man, after hours in the sub is really something, isn't it?	24
1	/r/Christianity late night edition is the best /r/Christianity	24
1	There's honestly almost always someone like this guy you are responding to in this small community of Christians, which is why it surprises me that you are envious of this community.  I've learned a lot about the divisiveness of sectarian Christianity here.  Though I think a lot of the worst left after several large blowups about the fact that the top mod identifies as atheist.	24
1	You said that the fact that atheists feel comfortable here likely means that Christ wouldnt have good things to say about our community. Youve also told OP, an atheist, that they should hate us. If thats not advocating for purposely causing hate and persecution for ourselves, I dont know what is.	24
1	You should see it on Saturday night!	24
1	[...](http://i.imgur.com/RTENitu.gif)	24
1	I think you are mischaracterizing r/atheism. It's really not that bad at all! Certainly not like it was years ago when they dropped it from the default list. It's come a long way. Now and then a believer will pop in and ask some earnest questions and they are treated with sincere respect.	24
1	Luke 6:26  Woe to you when **everyone** speaks well of you, for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.  ________________________________________ It doesn't say woe to you when anyone or someone speaks well of you- it says everyone.  To me that means if everyone is speaking well of you, you are only telling people what they want to hear and not what they need to hear.	24
1	Yes, and that can also explain all the negative stereotypes about atheists.  [Here's a nice blog post going into detail](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/04/selection-bias-and-atheist-stereotypes/):  &gt;On the other hand, consider the average person’s experience with atheists. They may know many atheists. Their next door neighbor, or boss, or close friend might be an atheist. But they don’t hear about it. It rarely comes up in random conversation.	24
1	That doesn't mean it isn't bigoted.	24
1	I'm saying they are wrong. They are harming their lgbt students, alumni, and faculty.	24
1	These click bait titles need to stop	24
1	Well to be fair here, according to Lutherans you follow the Antichrist. So I donno, I wish youd post some disclaimer whenever you mention the real Christ.	24
1	You can do this as an atheist as well.	24
1	I agree with you there that they at least treat believers with respect *when they post* in /r/atheism. Otherwise, discussion tends to be highly disrespectful, and on occasion, hateful.	24
1	&gt; Or the marginalised.   This is important to keep in mind. Christianity as a pervasive cultural phenomenon pushes out members who find it difficult to hold certain beliefs, basically excluding people from the culture they were born into. No wonder that results in some unpleasantness.	24
1	Given the greatest challenge modern science faces is how to realistically feed our ever expanding population, research into defeating ageing perplexes me immensely.	24
1	&gt; Basically, it comes down to, "You Christians sure aren't bad when you shut the f%# up about the Gospel."  Interesting to note this goes both ways: "Those atheists sure aren't bad when they.shut the f%# up about their disbelief."  This was an idea that "New Atheism" challenged: that it was ok to profess belief publicly, but not ok to talk about disbelief.	24
1	You can try, but it won't work.  Gods design is specific, and to receive God's blessings, you have to believe He exists, at the very least.	24
1	Whenever I see something from /r/atheism pop up on /r/all, it strikes me that they think we are all in agreement on what it means to be a Christian. I'm always kind of like, "Yeah I think that's fucked up too. But that's not what the majority of us believe."	24
1	Food isn't the issue. Getting food to where it is needed is. That's more an issue of politics, logistics, and sociology than it is science.	24
1	Looking at Huckabee, I can definitely understand this point of view.	24
1	Most political arguments I have with family are about this. I believe the political right is the most dangerous threat to western Christianity. I just don't understand what is so hard about [1 Corinthians 5:12-13].	24
1	These people on the "religious right" don't believe it is a corruption, and I don't think its some conspiracy by those filthy conservatives to use religion to enslave people's minds.  Let's not get holier than thou, in many ways the people here aren't that different from the right-wing Christians they hate.	24
1	&gt;I appreciate that. But the guys you should really feel bad for are on /r/islam. The atheist subreddit has a lot of trash about christians thrown around, but the way they speak about muslims is just downright racist.   You realize Islam is not a race, right?	24
1	&gt;/r/Atheism, it's full of insults being thrown at the religious.  You will have to forgive them.   Many feel they have been lied to. Many have been persecuted for their lack of faith. Many see religion as a lie, that twists public policy and seriously harms the world.   If I was an Atheist I'd be angry too.	24
1	We would see marriage as the goal for all mankind, rather than celibacy being an option. The imagery of the Church as the Bride of Christ is no longer feasible. And then it gets kind of funky when you think about a wife of God-how does that fit into theology? Is she equal with her husband? If they are of one flesh, do we acknowledge the wife as well as God? Is she married to the rest of the Trinity as well?	24
1	Probably the reason people would be more comfortable with a gay president over an evangelical one was because the people (based on the survey attached to this article) find religion the least important issue for a president to be part of. If a person openly runs on their religion, I can see that be troubling.   Also, more people are comfortable today with an Evangelical President than they were in 2006. (Based on the survey this article is based on.)	24
1	I somewhat agree with this, but is having republicanlibertarian principles a bad thing? Im not talking about social issues here.	24
1	It's not about enslaving people's minds, it's about conflating political issues with religious ones to get elected.   Look at climate change, for example. Is this a Biblical topic? No, it's a political one. Then why are most conservative Evangelicals "against" climate change? Because it has been made into a Biblical topic.	24
1	/u/key_lime_pie offered an outstanding (gold x5) explanation of the relationship between right wing political positions and Christianity [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/25fu2t/why_is_the_american_christian_right_so_against/chgrn00).	24
1	&gt; I am petrified of Judgement day  And people were petrified about this 1800 years ago  Then again 1700 years ago   Then again 1600 years ago   Then again 1500 years ago  Nero was the antichrist. Hitler was the antichrist. Stalin was the antichrist. Pol Pot was the antichrist. Putin is the antichrist. Ratzinger was the antichrist. Saddam Hussein was the antichrist.  Alqaeda was the antichrist. Taliban was the antichrist. Now IS are the antichrist.  See a pattern?	24
1	This isn't biased at all.	24
1	I don't see anything that the "religious right" believes that contradicts anything in Christianity. Even on economic issues Christianity doesn't demand the state provide welfare programs, it just demands people provide for the poor which *could* mean just private charity not welfare though the Bible doesn't seem to commit you one way or the other. Liberal Christians just seem to get upset because the Bible doesn't always support their egalitarian beliefs, and when it doesn't they go with egalitarianism not the Bible. The religious right goes with the Bible.	24
1	A good book on the subject is *Moral Minority: The Evangelical Left in an Age of Conservatism* by David Swartz.  Really interesting thoughts on why the evangelical left (theologically conservative people with a desire for social justice) lost out to the Religious Right for political influence.	24
1	Huckabee has been working really hard lately to make Evangelicals indistinguishable from Westboro Baptists... It's downright sad :(	24
1	Don't forget people still remember Bush jr as well. But yeah, Huckabee is scary.	24
1	Plenty of Christians have been beheaded throughout the centuries, starting, if I'm not mistaken, with John The Baptist.  What makes you think the beheadings nowadays are any different?	24
1	My kitties are heeeeeere! They're gorgeous, delightful, and absolute unholy terrors! At the moment they're asleep on our bed and are being adorable.  This is about the only shot I have of them that's got both of them still and sort of looking at the camera :)  http://imgur.com/9LA1sBF	24
1	&gt; Have I misinterpreted this?  Yes.  This has been happening for centuries.	24
1	Jesus said how to behave, he never said to legally force others to behave that way. I don't understand why so few Christians (at least in the United States) get this.	24
1	I would say that giving constant tax breaks to the rich would at least seem like a paradox.  Also I'd argue that ignoring how many companies are destroying the planet is at least negligent on our behalf.   And my last and most important point, I'd say that for a group that follows the teaching of a man who spent half his ministry healing the sick, universal healthcare should be a no-brainer.	24
1	Yes, but when the state offers welfare / caring for the poor, the majority of the Religious Right goes "no, fuck that". So while yes, Christianity doesn't mandate state charity, it certainly is un-Christian to be *against* helping the poor, especially when this is done at the expense of small business tax breaks for hard working folk.   While the message of Jesus was to sell your business and give that money to the poor. But you'll never find *that* Bible verse on a conservative bumper sticker.	24
1	You would think most Christians would want to keep the planet pristine... I mean their deity gave it to them and wouldn't he be upset if humanity continued to destroy it?	24
1	IMO gods and goddesses are created in our own image, representing values the creators held important to them. If you exam gods/goddesses of various cultures you see they tend to reflect the people. Great example of this is the OT deity vs the NT... very different behaviour characters that changed based on those whom were creating them.	24
1	&gt; If you can be a convinced atheist after digesting that book, you can be an atheist for life.  I can't be the only person uncomfortable with claims like this, can I?	24
1	Everything has some inherent bias if it makes a point.  This is a silly complaint.	24
1	Is it truly disrespectful if they are just talking amongst themselves? I don't see anything at all wrong with poking fun at absurd beliefs other people hold, or seriously discussing the dire consequences of those beliefs, when you aren't directly trying to offend someone by brigading their sub or responding to people personally. If people are just laughing (or critiquing) amongst themselves about a shared belief system or value or lack thereof, who is offended? How is that a problem?	24
1	I don't know how common this position is, but at least some people believe that destroying the planet (or making it uninhabitable by humans) via climate change or nuclear war or whatever is impossible, because God wouldn't let it happen. Only God can destroy the world at the end of time.   ...or whatever.	24
1	Right, and that's why the Oil companies' arguments of "Let's rape the Earth (for our profit), because Biblical" is so unnerving. As long as these companies support socially conservative candidates, the Religious Right goes along and even promotes the message.   I believe it was Mark Driscoll who infamously boasted that he drove an SUV and didn't care about pollution because Jesus was about to come back and destroy the planet anyway.	24
1	&gt; It should also be noted that it seems conservatives give more to charity than liberals.   Who gives more?  [An MIT study demonstrated that the answer is neither.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1100129/who-gives.pdf)  The study also counters "the notion that political conservatives compensate for their opposition to governmental intervention by supporting private charities."	24
1	STP, what's happening?	24
1	I am mentioning your name	24
1	The big takeaway, losing your special pedestal is not oppression.	24
1	And in response, I can't get why people who believe that no one should be able to legally force people to act in a Christian manner can support banning gay marriage, which is legally forcing people to act in a Christian manner.	24
1	&gt; I believe the political right is the most dangerous threat to western Christianity.  You can't say things like that and simultaneously pat yourself on the back for not otherizing. You're doing the same thing, just from the opposite side.	24
1	I agree that if the argument is phrased as "other places have it worse, therefore what we do is okay", it is fallacious.  I disagree that what our country is doing is unjust when it comes to religious treatment, on the whole. Ours is a melting pot, a state not founded upon a religion nor ruled by it.  We are a nation of peoples of numerous faiths and no faiths; our rule and law must be secular to treat everyone as equal and avoid granting undue privilege.  And to be perfectly frank, I find that any religious law worth following can be backed by secular argument.	24
1	Well, not quite. Conservatives *do* give more to charity, but this is almost entirely explained by the fact that more conservatives are Christian. Conservative beliefs are not the driving factor.	24
1	&gt; It should not be surprising that the majority doesn't want a Christian in the White House.   That's not at all what it said.	24
1	&gt;That doesn't justify what our country is doing.  What is your country doing?	24
1	Making me bake a cake for the gays. (I am being sarcastic)	24
1	Like u/Gemmabeta said, just slowly chipping away at the special pedestal Christianity has been on in America. A lot of Christians seem to be confusing this with persecution and oppression. It's why I can't stand going to my hometown church anymore. That among other reasons.	24
1	i resent the notion that we only have 34 leaders	24
1	So I can't disagree because they are entitled to their views?	24
1	Are you serious right now	24
1	That's more a war on humans than specifically Christians.	24
1	Also (whether it is true or not), the perception of evangelism is that it has a "I know better than you what you need." attitude.  Not a positive personality trait in a Presidential candidate.	24
1	Because every time I state that I don't believe that the political right is in line with Christian values, everyone assumes I'm an atheist Democrat, and I'm *sick* of it.	24
1	Perhaps, but abortion is not just a Christian issue. There are many of other faiths and atheists who are against it.	24
1	This is obviously meant to be an abrasive thread, but I think it's reasonable to say the right wing is consistent with Christian social values at least...  * Abortion * Marriage  * Women * Education  Fiscal issues are more complex, but Matthew Chapter 20 seems to reject egalitarian ideals while affirming the right to private property so it's not too much of a stretch to say that Scripture is right-leaning. The Vatican affirmed the right to private property and outright rejected socialism, so a Catholic can't really align too far to the left without committing a heresy.	24
1	&gt;we lost the evolution issue, we lost the gay marriage issue, we lost abortion  The only thing you ever "lost" is the ability to try and make others live by your rules and beliefs. You don't have to accept the truth of evolution, get gay married or have an abortion. You just can't try and impose laws or rules on the public according to your religion.	24
1	Francis Chan, John Piper, Mark Chandler, Tim Keller	24
1	&gt; we would be able to have the power to make others live by our rules and beliefs  Yes, in a world in which the majority persecutes its minorities (see: many other countries) we could do that.  But our Constitution, and our judicial branch, protect minorities from the tyranny of the majority.  Also, LOL at "outlawing evolution".	24
1	Would you apply that same sentiment to welfare?	24
1	The argument is that marriage is inherently religious. People seldom say atheists shouldn't be able to get married too though.   I'm of the opinion that the government shouldn't issue marriage licenses or confer any benefits for being married.	24
1	The concensus is still out asto whether you can "kill" ie murder something with no brain.	24
1	And two men sat down to pray.   And the first man said, thank you god that I am not like those stupid right wing Christians who divide America and push and Agenda.    And the second man, a rich right wing publican and a tax collector said, forgive me, be merciful to me lord, for I am a sinner.    I tell you, this man went to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted	24
1	Well, it is an opinion piece.	24
1	Thank you for this very "unifying" article, my liberal friend! Now tell me when Christianity has ever not been political.	24
1	&gt;you are missing my point  &gt;is proof that were are not the politically powerful majority that some would like to pretend we are.    I think you're missing the point of a free society. Even powerful majorities don't get to control the lives of the minority. The amount of political power shouldn't matter.	24
1	No. It is merely an argument that has no basis in any god. Under secularism, in a country with religious freedom, it is equally wrong to pass a law based on the Koran and bind all people of all faiths to it as it is to pass a law on the bible. A secular argument and a secular law means that no one should be bound by law to follow a law of a religion.	24
1	&gt; So they really hate people who are gay, or who are soldiers. Both semi common opinions  most of the people who hold these semi-common opinions subconciously know that they are wrong to hold them. Its the difference between being a racist in your head and joining the KKK.	24
1	Godwin's law, right off the bat, wow.  Got some handy links for us with quotes for the comments removed, oh two day old account whose profile shows no removals?	24
1	I think you are completely off base with this accusation. I also notice you haven't provided a single example. So far all the new mods are doing excellent jobs and even taking the time to consider decisions that were protested. Did you even try to ask this in mod mail first?	24
1	&gt; famous, large church head, Evangelical leader  This is the fallacy of your list. The fame is what tends to corrupt. There are hundreds of good evangelicals for every one on your list. They just arent famous because they havent caused a scandal.	24
1	Okay, several things:  1. You have not given us evidence to validate your claims.   2. Assuming such evidence exists she's had the job a week. She might just need to settle into it, so this is probably premature.   3. Even if such evidence existed in such abundance that no person could rationally doubt it, comparisons between an Internet forum and the Third Reich make you sound hysterical and seriously impugns your argument.   I suggest you delete this, take a breath, and tell us what's wrong in a calmer, more moderate fashion if you want public comment. Otherwise, just message the mod team.	24
1	And she gave you a reason why it was removed. If you have a problem with that you take it to mod mail. You don't come here complaining about it.	24
1	I am not going to take any kind of action on this post, as I feel it would be a conflict of interest. If anyone has any questions/concerns/suggestions for me, I'd be happy to discuss them here, in a PM, or in modmail.   Thanks for bearing with me as I learn the ropes, everybody.	24
1	It accepted Jesus as it's Lord and Savior, duh	24
1	I think Lulu should delete this thread.	24
1	It wouldn't be normally, but come on. If a mod gives you a reason for something being removed you respond to them first. You don't need to make a whole new post about it first.	24
1	Banned for correcting Mod.	24
1	Isn't this just passive aggressively asserting the holier-than-thou rhetoric that it is denouncing?	24
1	To be clear, I was seconds from deleting the post myself. /u/LuluthePanda got to it before me. I'm in agreement. It was an inappropriate post.	24
1	I think the bigger problem is fear that an evangelical president will legislate their religion, which is something most evangelical candidates have claimed they plan to do. I'm terrified that a president might want to take away my right to run for public office due to my lack of penis, for instance.	24
1	Well if you're running for president you think you are capable of being the leader of 300 million people, you can't do that unless you think highly of yourself.	24
1	Gay people are sinners and going to hell? Isn't that the primary message?	24
1	How is it the Eucharist? You keep using that word, but I don't think you know what it means.	24
1	*Those people* are snakes.  Those people are hypocrites.  Those people are *the* most dangerous threat.  Those people demonize the other.   Unlike us.	24
1	&gt; We should do atheists in this sub a favor.  ayy lmao  *brings out rock em sock em robots*	24
1	My flair didn't give away that I'm on the outside myself? Huh. Well, I appreciate what you are saying but consider this - Can an outsider see the difference between Sunni and Shia Islam? Respectfully, not being able to see the differences does not mean that they are not there.	24
1	May I ask why? It seems reasonable to me that if Christians are not to "legally force others to behave that way," one could easily apply that to charity as well.	24
1	I find it very telling that you describe sexual orientation as a fetish.	24
1	&gt;We should do atheists in this sub a favor  Could you be a chap and bring me some onions?, I need them to prepare dinner.	24
1	Christianity does not hold a monopoly on the concept of marriage. Why should the state be limited to "civil unions"?	24
1	As an experiment I would love to see the upvote % if the title was reversed. The left and Christianity.	24
1	That is not what a lot of people are hearing.	24
1	Thats a really misleading title to what is actually happening.	24
1	Fetish? Ugh.  Also: separation of church and state.	24
1	Yes, firing or denying employment because a woman has had an abortion or uses contraceptives or has had their tubes tied is discriminatory (and isn't that also a HIPPA violation?).   Should we also fire men for using condoms or Viagra?	24
1	There is no war on Christianity in the US. There is only people freeing themselves from its historical grip on our social mores and moral judgements.	24
1	Why is it that one assumes that being gay = not being Christian?	24
1	The bill said "reproductive health decisions", not just abortions.	24
1	&gt; One must also keep in mind that a Christian is not free to cherry-pick those passages that appeal to their sensibilities, as the Bible is meant to be the word of their God.  This is as intellectually lazy an argument as Biblical literalism itself is.	24
1	I *did* read it.  It is still rubbish.	24
1	But *why*? There is literally no point	24
1	Might want to look into the study of neurology surrounding gay/trans human brains verse heterosexual if you think it's a fetish.	24
1	How about "marriage"	24
1	Except most Catholics and Episcopalians accept evolution. Many Episcopalians , and other Anglicans, as well as many non denoms accept gay marriage. And there are many Christians who are pro choice.	24
1	All other factors aside, I don't want someone who is convinced that we are living in the end times and that this is a good thing anywhere near the office of Commander in Chief. Keep your apocalyptic fixation and rapture ready self well away from power.	24
1	&gt; sexual fetish  This is an expression of bigotry.	24
1	If Paul were around today, something tells me he'd identify Mr. Osteen as a false prophet.	24
1	That seems like a pretty biased statement.	24
1	&gt;Cochran City Council voted **against the advice of its attorney** to fly the flag at City Hall	24
1	"How the religious left corrupts Christianity?"	24
1	And Joel Osteen has never taken any advice from Jesus either.	24
1	How so? What's wrong with allowing your religion to influence who you vote for or what you vote on?	24
1	This is a true saying, and worthy of all men to be received, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save municipal governments.  It's always weird to me that the people who can't think of a single thing they admire about the Christian church after it became Rome's state religion are the same ones who want it to be an American state religion.  Seriously, when has state sponsorship brought us anything but insincerity and corruption?	24
1	&gt; If none of the citizens of cochran city care, why should they take it down?  Some people cared and contacted [AU](https://www.au.org/).  How many should have to care?	24
1	I think there's a difference between choosing not to attempt to extend one's own life after one has died (DNR) and ending it prematurely (Euthanasia).	24
1	&gt; Did they talk to the city council first?  No, thank you. They didn't seem like reasonable people. They did this despite their own lawyers advice.	24
1	&gt;Don't forget people still remember Bush jr   Not enough. If they did, people wouldn't be so keen to revitalize his policies.	24
1	How far do we take it? Should we outlaw divorce, adultery and masturbation?  The same people that want to prevent gay marriage also want to blow up the entire Middle East. War is far worse than some gay guys getting a piece of paper.	24
1	I need this all day every day.	24
1	&gt; Everyone here loves each other equally  I am having a discussion with a user here who is literally defending genocide and the idea that some toddlers are so evil that they need to be killed.	24
1	The percentage of people who complain is irrelevant. The Constitution does not guarantee rights contingent upon popularity. It guarantees them, period.	24
1	......It's a book describing an interpretation of **the Bible**.  Look, I'm not asking you to change your point of view, or to follow the book's advice blindly, just to help you understand its point of view. The more you understand an opposing opinion, the more effectively you can argue against it.	24
1	How did the KJV lead to more divisions in the church?  Edit: 1536?!? King Henry VIII and the KJV??? You might need to brush up on your history champ.	24
1	&gt;Can you guys name a famous, large church head, Evangelical leader, outside of maybe Billy Graham, that hasn't gone completely off the rails with some kind of horrific scandal...   Yeah, loads. Rich Warren, Tim Keller, James Boyce (deceased now, but a childhood favorite on car trips), RC Sproul, John Piper, JI Packer, and that was just stream of consciousness in the first 5 seconds. You could probably throw Rob Bell in there too even though he's not evangelical anymore, because he certainly didn't flame out in any kind of scandal.	24
1	I don't think belief in the benefits of welfare necessarily depends on Christian faith	24
1	Well, it *would* stick it to all those dirty atheists and people who worship the Constitution.	24
1	Unless a 5 percent of the population complain.	24
1	It's a bit presumptuous to assume that the Pope is not guided by the Holy Spirit but you are, isn't it? :-\	24
1	A little over a week ago a doctor said "ITS DANGEROUS OUT THERE TAKE THIS." http://i.imgur.com/tNhdXKP.jpg	24
1	This is brilliant. The very definition of 'wedge issues' that were discussed in today's 'Religious Right' thread.   Experience, leadership, honesty, communication, commitment, patriotism, knowledge, ability?   All those things are irrelevant if the candidate is pro-$wedgeIssue.   Hell, by this pdf's logic, all you need to do is run a pro-life monkey against our candidate, and the Catholics would have to vote for the monkey.	24
1	That we're stupid. See "Weeds" for the most egregious example.	24
1	What liberties are being eroded? What can't you do that you think you should be able to?	24
1	Dude, the Tribune Herald is a [joke website](http://tribuneherald.net/about/), it's not illegal to masturbate in Texas.	24
1	Christians don't know science.	24
1	You think that (conservative) Christians are oppressed because they can't get a law passed to deny liberty to other people and have that law withstand constitutional scrutiny.	24
1	Jesus is Fox News and Fox News is Jesus.	24
1	We can't know.	24
1	"Mariolatrist"  "Romanist"	24
1	It's not the movie / TV stereotypes that get my goat.  It's the real life "But the Bible says..." Christians that don't do any research on the thing they're basing their life around.  They think a cursory knowledge of thing and some feelings are enough develop a good understanding of what they believe.	24
1	Only a small minority of humans will be saved. The rest will spend eternity in hell because they either never heard the Gospel, or they heard it and rejected it.  That's what I was taught as a child raised in church.  Of course, I think that's BS now.	24
1	Racist Christian strawmen are my least favorite.	24
1	Are you unfamiliar with the point of political cartoons? It raises a serious point, and is relevant to this discussion.	24
1	Did you know that every Episcopalian believes in the same things as John Shelby Spong?	24
1	True. Unfortunately there are some people in real life that help perpetuate that. And it *really* does not help when elected and supposedly educated people get caught saying things like climate change is not real because God would not let it happen, or that evolution is a lie from the pit of hell. So while that stereotype is exaggerated, there is regrettably some truth to it.	24
1	Wait, what? Amendments? The Constitution?   You do realize then, that because what the locals are doing in flying their 'silly flag' is a violation of the First Amendment, it shouldn't be allowed either?	24
1	When your church's message sounds just like self-help or "common sense" or something you'd hear on Oprah, it's probably wrong.	24
1	It's cheaper to pay a salary than hourly. Those Sunday hours would be expensive.	24
1	Stereotypes don't create themselves. They all have some semblance of truth to them.  There are some people that perpetuate it, on the other side of the coin, there are people that put words into the mouths of Christians then argue against those words.	24
1	Our priests are ALWAYS the secret-passers/help to the bad guys in like, every America vs. Russia spy movie ever.	24
1	What confuses me is that there's people who actually believe that rings "should" be "two months' salary" and that weddings can't cost less than $20,000 in modern day.	24
1	That we all shout in tongues during service.  I'm charismatic.	24
1	Wow. That labored-looking cursive frightened me enough, but the language itself is a [sic] jungle.  In seriousness, Driskell probably has a mental health issue, which alone makes me uncomfortable joking too much about this.	24
1	Calling her "woman" was a term of respect and endearment - it didn't come across the way it sounds in English in our day.	24
1	Tiridates III of Armenia proclaimed Christianity as the state religion of his kingdom a full 12 years before Constantine even officially legalized Christianity, and Rome didn't follow suit until Theodosius I, decades after Constantine was dead. There were plenty of Christians hanging out in or near positions of power before him (Most famously St. George, an army officer martyred by Diocletian); the latter fact is a large part of what convinced Diocletian to launch his persecution in the first place. It's not as if Christians had never thought of being politically active prior to Constantine giving them the idea, they just weren't numerous or secure enough to actually do it.	24
1	Great. Use holy matrimony. That way you can distinguish yourself from married atheists, too	24
1	&gt; If there is, then we've been oppressing 1st cousins, adults who wish to marry children, and polygamous couples for just as long as we've been "oppressing" homosexuals.  Yeah I'm sorry, but you lose all credibility the moment you compare a relationship between two consenting adults to an adult abusing a child. (Speaking of hyperbolic inaccurate arguments....)  The cartoon is on point.	24
1	There have been some discussions on /r/conspiratard from people in your spot.  You may want to take a look	24
1	As usual, this line of argument still fails to effectively deal with infertility as well as celibacy.	24
1	We're closer than we were yesterday. I don't think we can know any more specifically than that.	24
1	Could be in a minute, could be a million+ years from now. Honestly I don't think we are all that close, but we should be ready anyway.  YouTube is great for some things. It is horrible when it comes to end times "prophecy".	24
1	This has been posted in all the LGBT-related subs today (multiple times!), along with a crop of other Westboro-wannabe stories like the [LGBT-murdering Christian video game](http://holybulliesandheadlessmonsters.blogspot.com/2015/05/christian-developer-creates-video-game.html#.VUproOTGIaZ).  Yeah, LGBT people see all this stuff.  We understand it's from the fringe, but unfortunately it influences views of Christianity (and Christ) anyway.  It's not really that far off [Dobson's rhetoric](http://mobile.wnd.com/2015/05/dobson-fall-of-western-civilization-at-hand/), after all.	24
1	I'm just very tired of the assertion that the only requirement for sex to be considered "of the procreative type" is for it to be, to put it crudely, ejaculation into a vagina; I'm also very tired of the identification of marriage as this amazing fundamental good from a religion that would actually prefer its adherents not to do so.	24
1	&gt; I would say that we're closer than we were two thousand years ago  Maybe in your plebian, normie concept of time *smugface*	24
1	Celibacy is the emphasized ideal. Marriage is...well, it's fine. It's good, in fact. But you have a celibate Christ, you have Paul encouraging followers to be celibate and describing marriage as a path for those who couldn't be celibate, you have the whole monastic tradition. Marriage is not touted as the ideal.	24
1	It ain't just one gear in my neck of the woods...	24
1	The love of a husband for his wife is supposed to be like that of Christ, yes.	24
1	That's a horrible argument though. It is a fact that marriage is not inherently religious, as evidenced by the enormous amount of non-religious marriages throughout human history. Sometimes arguments come down to beliefs and opinions, but in this case that's just flat out wrong.	24
1	Marriage, as Paul describes it, is the lesser of two evils. "better to marry than to burn with lust."	24
1	You disagree with views that you can't even define?	24
1	It's great if you like abortions and pregnant teenagers with STDs.	24
1	My opinion is data shows it doesn't work.	24
1	Well, according to St. Paul (2 Co. 5.19) the *whole world* has already been reconciled. Now, as to whether and how that is appropriated, that's another discussion. But I would argue that God's property is, as the old Prayer of Humble Access puts it, "to always have mercy."	24
1	It's definitely destructive. I would heartily educate my kids on sex, even while telling them I expected abstinence (but am forgiving).	24
1	There are real dangers and risks to sex. There are real moral problems associated with sex. But the average age of marriage in the United States is 28. Leaving people in the dark about sex until they're nearly 30 is absurd.	24
1	I think it leaves out vital information, like every form of birth control other than abstinence.	24
1	&gt; This way kids will make *their own decision on why abstinence is best*  BWUAHAHA	24
1	Maybe instead of being offended, you should consider that person's experience with compassion.  What is their experience with a Christian upbringing that has soured and disillusioned them?  What is the experience that they have had that has made fundamentalist Christians seem so unpleasant?	24
1	Abstinance only sex ed is like trying to prevent drowning by *not* teaching kids how to swim. Just showing them pictures of sharks does not do a lick of good when the kids finds themselves in the deep end of the pool.	24
1	My fiancee's engagement ring is a family heirloom,  and we're going for a $2,000 wedding with a limit of $3,000. We would rather not have to spend that much, but our friends and family will kill us if we don't have some sort of actual wedding. Besides she'll get to look and be a princess for a day, so it's worth it.	24
1	It's more of the way it was phrased that made me laugh. Seems to imply every kid will come to the same conclusion.	24
1	&gt; Calling her "woman" was a term of respect and endearment - it didn't come across the way it sounds in English in our day.  Yes your right. I just looked it up. Thanks for the clarification.	24
1	&gt;My opinion  &gt;data  That's not how opinions work tho.	24
1	I don't like Christian euphemisms; they make me feel like I'm not participating in a movement seeking truth but seeking self-preservation. Stuff like   * "Biblical" (Correct)  * "God put this on my heart" (I think)  * "[insert verbal beatdown here, *friend*" (...but don't get offended about this because I'm being nice™)  * "I'll pray for you" (Fuck you)  * "Lukewarm" (Heterodox)  Et cetera. Maybe it's just because I'm a blunt asshole who wants everyone else to talk like me?	24
1	"Set me on fire" ... [two weeks later].... "I'm burned out".	24
1	"It's a God thing" for "everything ended up working"  Hate to break it to you, but the stuff you don't like is God things too.	24
1	Agreed.  Or Christian-isms like, "Brother/sister, God will never put more on you than you can bear."  Sat in a Sunday school class once when a person in good health said this to a woman dying of cancer.  Sometimes, life gives you an ass-kicking that absolutely is more than you can bear.	24
1	Yeah I know. I was trying to be clever.	24
1	Nope. Can't wait, actually. Going to be sweet not having to deal with my sinful desires and abhorrent temptations.	24
1	"relevant utter incompetence"?  You don't think the government should educate and protect its' people? That's extreme, even for a libertarian.	24
1	It's the little things in life that make me happy...	24
1	"It's not a religion, it's a relationship."	24
1	The last part is rather important.  Imo the most important thing one can have with children is open communication about these things.  A child that is afraid to ask for help after it fucked up isn't a good thing.	24
1	"Soul winning" is just a cringey phrase to me, it gives me the wrong impressions about the goals and motivations of evangelists.	24
1	That article is 9 years old and has been criticized in it's assumptions and methodologies. [Here](http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/31/business/la-fi-mh-conservatives-or-liberals-20140331) is a recent article explaining the problems with it.   If you Google the subject, most studies find that conservatives give more dollars, and poorer conservatives a higher percentage of AGI, but that a lot of that increase is to their own churches. That means that the final amount actually being used in charitable endeavors is reduced.	24
1	He sent out ambassadors to announce the Good News of that reconciliation that had been accomplished on God's part, and to invite people to embrace and accept it, with the consequence of changed lives in this world and the age to come.	24
1	The main difference is that there are actually issues within the U.S. when it comes to the LGBTQ community, they don't have all the rights others do in the U.S., whereas the 'persecution' experienced by American Christians is that they are no longer allowed to control how other people live their lives and not only that, doesn't even live up to a biblical example of persecution.	24
1	But shouldnt the children be taught safe sex?	24
1	I hate the word fellowship as a verb.	24
1	Abstinence only education is working as intended here in Texas  http://www.rawstory.com/2015/05/chlamydia-outbreaks-hits-nearly-10-percent-of-small-texas-school-in-district-with-no-sex-ed-policy/#.VUd_MTbXIQk.reddit	24
1	If anyone is kept from promotions or generally mistreated for not attending, it is inappropriate.	24
1	I think the Ten Commandments **are** part of the *legal* foundation of this country, along with Menes, Hammurabi, Solomon, Lycurgus, Solon, Draco, Confucius, Octavian, Justinian, Mohammed, Charlemagne, King John, Louis IX, Hugo Grotius, Sir William Blackstone, John Marshall and Napoleon.  This is why you can find a representation of each in the stonework within the building of the Supreme Court.  Maybe they couldn't fit all the other names on that piece of paper...	24
1	Don't know why title does not use articles. Articles important.	24
1	It doesn't work. My religious school taught abstinence first sex ed. The only method guaranteed to always work, coupled with what our religion says	24
1	This comment is hard to read.  Edit: Now I feel bad. Stop downvoting him guys :(	24
1	Luckily that isn't the only alternative	24
1	I'm not allowed to make alternative points?	24
1	Marriage is supposed to represent Christ's love for the church. Husband = Christ. Wife = church. Both utterly devoted and self-sacrificing.	24
1	The blinds are outdated as hell.	24
1	The Holy Spirit protects the Church from error in specific cases where we are making infallible statements regarding faith and morals. Marriage is one of those cases, but that doesn't mean that everything the Pope or Church does and says is infallible.   You don't even understand infallibility but you still criticize it.	24
1	&gt;Describing the correct way to eat doesn't say you have to eat.  I didn't know Catholicism was alright with suicide.  &gt;Nor does it make throwing up due to illness immoral.  Throwing up due to illness isn't immoral. Choosing to have non-procreative sex, in this framework, is immoral. But then the framework offers an exception for those whose non-procreative sex consists of ejaculation into a vagina. A better comparison would be eating without the ability to gain any nutritional benefit from eating.	24
1	I think parents should teach their kids that abstinence is the first option, but not the only option.	24
1	Hands down this wins. Also "It's not a religion, it's a *philosophy*."	24
1	The eagle is clearly fake	24
1	Mine is that we're too "ethnic" (whatever that means) for the average American. This is usually code for "I didn't want to look too hard, so I used this to dismiss the religion out of hand."	24
1	&gt;There is something wrong with the American Church if this is thought to be acceptable.  There's an American church? News to me.	24
1	If marriage is signing up for children, infertile marriage doesn't exist. An infertile couple can't sign up for children.	24
1	&gt; Why should the state be limited to "civil unions"?  I'm in the camp that believes it doesn't matter what you call it on paper. To everyone else you're "married," to the state you have signed a contract with some person.	24
1	So childfree couples shouldn't be allowed to get married?	24
1	1. The framing is bad. 1. They really didn't need to use flash just a slower shutter speed and a tripod. 1. ?	24
1	&gt;But only a man and woman together can commit to a loving union of the kind inherently oriented to family life and appropriate to being the mother and the father of their children  This gave me a chuckle.	24
1	We had ours in our apartment that we had just rented together, wearing pajamas. We each picked out our own rings, mine was $100 and his was $80, and after we were married his parents took us to Mexican food. It was amazing.  When I tell people that most of the ones who had big weddings talk about how badly they wanted to do that instead, between the pressure and the family drama and the expense. It's really a cultural expectation that it seems like a lot of people want to opt out of but feel like they can't.	24
1	"Only God can judge me."  The subtext being that God is on my side and approves of my behavior even if you can't see that.	24
1	Another difference is that teaching kids safe sex is not like teaching them to swim because you do not need to get anywhere near having sex to learn to do it safely and you absolutely need to get in the water to learn how to swim.  Even if you were morally opposed to swimming, if there was a way to teach your child to swim without having them swim I'm pretty sure that would be preferable since it prevents them from drowning in the event that they decide to go swimming against your wishes.	24
1	"Believe *on* the Lord Jesus Christ"  "He put it on my heart"  "Zombie God"  "Sky Wizard"	24
1	I've never been to the one that our city hosts, but I've seen the pictures.  The backdrop is an American flag.  Looking at the participating list of churches is a bit like visiting /r/truechristian if you get my drift.    I think what once had some ecumenical leanings has now been fully co-opted by the conservatives.  I can guarantee that if I listen to the  webcast tomorrow I will hear a lot of pastors praying that we need to "take back our country".  I'm not exactly sure from whom, but I'm afraid they are very sure.  TL;DR:  Increasingly creeped out every year.	24
1	Either that the Church of England was 'founded by King Henry VIII'  just so he could legalise divorce or that Henry VIII started Protestantism in England.	24
1	It was more a clarification because you were half right.	24
1	I think those categories refer to doctrinal conservatism/liberalism, not in the political sense. There are politically liberal creationists, but creationism is a conservative doctrine (it was the traditional teaching of the church). Universalism is a break from traditional church teachings on the afterlife, so it's more liberal.  Notice that /r/ProLife is *not* listed as "conservative", despite being championed mostly by political conservatives.	24
1	Screw them. Dinosaurs kick ass.	24
1	Natural Law^TM. The all-purpose "We have no real argument but just insist that something 'just is' this way" card.	24
1	If not, I have some serious concerns about how I'm going to get this baby out in two weeks.	24
1	There is so much malarkey in those two lines I wouldn't know where to end, so I'm not going to start	24
1	If it doesn't matter what you call it on paper, what does it matter if it says 'marriage' on the paper?   Oh right, other people don't like it.	24
1	Why do you disagree?	24
1	An infertile couple can't be open to procreation. An infertile couple can have no intent in this regard. If they know they're infertile, this is obvious. If they don't, it's just irrationality born of ignorance. In both cases, it is a biological impossibility.	24
1	The Evangelical flair always gets me. Anyone with it is a man, even if I know they're not.	24
1	Seriously, I hope Fox News Headquarters burns to the ground..  ...uhh (Oh my, that sounded really bad)..I mean.....While it's closed and noone is inside,of course! But perhaps all of their money is inside....and...and...It all gets flung out of the building and the bills get carried throughout the city streets by the Holy Gust (pun intended) and falls into the hands of the local homeless residents.. (phew, that was a close one)  lol smooth save, me. smooth save.	24
1	Is there a better source for information on this? FoxNation is a garbage dump for objective information, the Campus Reform article seems hardly any better. I'd hate for a *legitimate* abuse of academic authority to be buried under witch-hunting or fear-mongering (ie why is it relevant that the professor has a Marxist quoted in his emails?)	24
1	TIL condoms and birth control pills are equal to huffing gasoline. I hope your daughter never needs BC pills to help with menstrual issues since she might as well be huffing gasoline	24
1	I don't care what people do outside of the church. I do wonder how many of those are culturally Catholic, Protestant and evangelical. I know too many people who say they are Catholic or any Protestant group and haven't been to Church in years. Or ask them about a doctrine of the group they identify with and either don't know it or have a very wrong understanding of the doctrine. Not that it excused the behavior.	24
1	A few of my engineering friends work for companies that specialize in drills and things like that.  Let me know if you need some help. :P	24
1	The male silhouette is lying to my brain. It's true, I assume everyone with Evangelical flair is a man.	24
1	After reading her papers, she basically called out the professor, berated his questions instead of asking for clarification, and preached about Christianity, after it's clearly stated she'd get a zero for that kind of thing. Just seems like a dumb move on her part to spend all of that time preaching at her professor to just get a zero.	24
1	I wish I can gold this comment so hard. Here, have some reddit silver instead.	24
1	At least link it! :-p  http://i.imgur.com/sy9lVl4.jpg	24
1	&gt; I was at a wedding once where a priest said that you should imagine your spouse like they're Jesus at all times, and he even got strangely sexual with the metaphor.  wat.	24
1	Agree, seems like she didn't like the questions, didn't do them, now wants to whine because she got the grade she deserves.  And of course, now scream about persecution because how dare they make her do any critical thinking.	24
1	Its not an odd question. It gets asked [a lot](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/search?q=aliens&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all)  The Bible doesn't mention America or Dinosaurs, both things that exist (or existed in the case of extinct animals).	24
1	I think everyone here has missed what is undoubtedly the most important part of this article:   "Also in the audience was a uniformed delegation from the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team."  I really hope Papa Francis played HORSE with them.   And schooled them.	24
1	Those people do not understand what marriage is. It has nothing to do with transient and changing feelings. It is two people who serve each other.	24
1	Marriage is about *agape*, not *eros*. So I think the "falling out of love" thing is bs, frankly. The Orthodox Church allows divorce in a few circumstances-and thats not one of them.	24
1	Then they should learn how to serve each other.	24
1	Love isn't something you fall in or out of in the historical understanding of the Church. That's limerence, it has nothing to do with love, and its presence or absence has little or nothing to do with marriage. It's just not a feeling, so frankly that argument in a Christian context strikes me as incoherent rambling of a type even Town Meeting in my town manages to surpass in quality, which is embarrassing.   That said, I'm not sure what you're asking. I wish they wouldn't divorce and I wish our social institutions wouldn't normalize it.	24
1	They should repent of their failure, and continue striving to serve one another.	24
1	The best way to describe it would be the way that God loves us. It's not romantic or warm and fuzzy-its the kind of love where you would willingly give your life for that person without question.	24
1	God does not make that an option. One can serve regardless of feelings, wants, or desires.	24
1	I think that's not even a sound view of Eros based on the authorities. It's limerence at best.	24
1	Youre supposed to have agape love for everyone. Being married helps you learn it.	24
1	This life isnt about satiating our desires.	24
1	We have no rote rituals like you backwards liturgical types. We just show up. Sing a song. Read an announcement. Do five more songs. Take the offering. Listen to a guy talk at us for thirty minutes. Than sing again.  We do that every single sunday, because we don't believe in rituals.	24
1	The habitual power of willing the good of others in friendship of which none can make bad use which God works within us without us.	24
1	&gt;Why should they repent of their failure?   They have failed to live out the love between Christ and His Church which is the goal of Marriage.  &gt;And what if they still fail?   Then they need to continue to repent, and strive to love and serve each other.  &gt;Should they die miserable?  Christianity isn't about being happy, and neither is Marriage.	24
1	The word being translated "immorality" is *porneia*, which is fairly specifically sexual.	24
1	Christ specifically tells us we're going to suffer.	24
1	Newb, so take my post as it is, but how could you possibly hold hate in your heart for the person you swore it to? You don't just wake up one day and realize you don't like the person you're married to. How can you really say you even "hate" someone?	24
1	*Baby don't hurt me*	24
1	What theologians have you read so far? It might help to know that most Christian churches don't have a problem with evolutionary theory.  You might check out [Biologos](http://biologos.org/) and this [resource](http://episcopalscience.org/resources/catechism-creation/) on creation and science that the Episcopal Church has put together.	24
1	The problem isn't that you are loving the wrong person, it's that you're loving the wrong way. When your approach to marriage is a basically self-serving consumerist one, you'll inevitably find unhappiness and rupture.	24
1	There is a wide range of acceptable answers for how God created.  Not believing Young Earth, 6-day Creationism doesn't put you outside of orthodox Christianity, even if you hear voices telling you that.	24
1	That is interesting, I didn't give a definition of fallacy.	24
1	And now comes the time to unsub	24
1	BECAUSE HE DISAGREES WITH THEM DARN IT!	24
1	&gt;  I think what it comes down to is that the church must find a way to express its ethics through better teaching if divorce is to be decried.  Better pre-marital counseling is the first step, in my opinion. I just see this as so very lacking. My priest does fifteen hours of "one-on-two" counseling with the couple before he will marry them, and maintains that his greatest pastoral success is convincing a engaged couple who came to him not to get married.	24
1	I think you're assuming love is a feeling and it's not. You cant fall out of love. You can stop loving someone, but that is a choice. Loving is a choice and it is shown in different ways... By how you serve people, but how you spend your time, and how you spend you money.	24
1	But it does challenge the idea that marriage is necessarily procreative.	24
1	Do I? Hahahahaha no I suck at loving people.	24
1	No one is forcing anybody to do anything. They made a binding agreement. I dont have agape love for my Husband, but I sure as hell know that I made a promise to him and to God that I'd spend my life working on it with him as my partner.	24
1	Nothing wrong with that.  Edit to add: I'm fairly sure this is the standard practice in Orthodox Judaism, or something similar.	24
1	You are absolutely allowed to decide what kinds of physical boundaries you want to set for yourself. Dont let anybody tell you thats wrong.	24
1	There isn't any standard by which you could be considered "wrong" for doing so but the following will likely be true:  1) you may find it exceedingly difficult to find a partner that shares your specific particular views and attitudes regarding the dugger's extremely confining and legalistic restrictions  2) Emotionally/psychologically it's relatively unhealthy behavior that will likely cause you and your family to stagnate in your emotional growth.  But it is your freedom to choose to do so, just as it is anyone else's freedom to disapprove.  Best of luck	24
1	Can you point me to the council that declared if one says Evolution happened let them be anathema?	24
1	This really can't be overemphasized.	24
1	Agree 100%.  Unless you are just going through the motions,  marriage is a vow under god.  IDC if people get "married" and are not a believer, it's whatever.  But... if two believers get married, under a vow to god, they will last through this life together.  I have seen it with my own eyes through older generations and current.  Love is a powerful thing when it comes from God/Christ.  It can change the hearts of nations, it can abolish fear.  Love is what we ALL need	24
1	"You boys ever seen a dunk over the Pope-mobile?"	24
1	You are aware that the percentage of teenagers who have sex has gone down in recent years, not up?  Seeing as how teenagers have been having sex since the dawn of time, I really don't see how preventing STDs as best as possible when that happens is "burning society down."	24
1	I'm not sure that would be productive.	24
1	Beautiful, well said. We are but nothing, as you said, we are but a "smudge of carbon on a rock in orbit around a main-sequence star in a galaxy that [we] can't even begin to comprehend". And yet this is the shape our God took. That which is higher yearned for that which is lower. And this is the greatest mystery of joy for man.	24
1	First and most importantly, thank you for your beautiful and wonderful testimony.  Second, thank you for that fantastic username.	24
1	My husband and I flew out to San Francisco to have a simple marriage by the justice of the peace in city hall.  We then went back to Dallas to have the reception with all our friends at a big enough place to fit all of them for not too much money.  We managed to get tungsten carbide rings off Overstock.com for about $40 each.  To us it wasn't about a big flashy spectacle. It was about showing our love for each other and sharing that with as many friends as possible.	24
1	I tend to agree with that.  People who think that their "falling out of love" is grounds for their own divorce probably a) didn't deeply love their spouse upon marriage and/or b) didn't understand the amount of work that any marriage takes, whether romantic love is plentiful or not.	24
1	In his image, they say, he made us. We perceive the universe, question it, and create. No animals on earth create like we do. We create like God Created, for better or for worse.	24
1	Divorce is ok here because your father is a monster and doesn't treat your mother like jesus did the church. being anti-divorce is not to believe that wives must suffer under non-biblical monsters.	24
1	No, but I can point you to Church fathers like Philo from the 1st century, Origen from the 3rd century, Augustine from the 4th century, and even Aquinas from the 13th century that tell me not to take Genesis literally	24
1	Christian marriage isn't about happiness.  Christianity isn't about happiness.  "Happiness Christianity" is a heresy in line with "Prosperity Christianity."  Happiness may come from the path, in certain times it almost certainly will, and in other times not so much.  But anyone who tells you or implies to you that Christianity is all about you, how you feel, whether or not you are happy, whether or not you are feeling fulfilled at all times...  That whole mindset is pretty much the opposite of Christianity.	24
1	Faith is not about being happy. Neither is marriage.	24
1	It's funny, the title of this sub is "All are welcome".  But as a Conservative Republican, I am not. This thread is proof.	24
1	You need to see a priest *and* a therapist. Both are necessary-we need to focus on both our spiritual and our physical well-being.  I know what youre going through-our experiences arent the same, but I struggle with depression and anxiety too. You need anything at all, you message me, yeah? I got your back :)  EDIT: Therapists cant give you drugs-they need to refer you to a psychiatrist. I told my therapist I didnt want meds and she worked with me around that. Youre totally in control of your healing.	24
1	How did you think they get baby oil?	24
1	I'd rather vote for a pro-life, pro-welfare Atheist than a pro-choice, lassiez-faire Christian.  That is to say my beliefs influence who I vote for, but on issues not on demographics. I'd have no qualms about voting for an Atheist.	24

1	I'm an American, but I still find it cute when Americans object to something because it is of "recent vintage."	24
1	They did more harm than good. And they didn't keep Arab Christians safe during their stay.  The Crusades were antithetical to Christian principle, and should never be glorified or justified.	24
1	That's a good book.  But I'm not sure why you share that particular quote?	24
1	The first point judges Muslims rather harshly. IIRC, it was only one ruler, Al Hakim, who persecuted Christians.	24
1	Reminded me of rejecting something based on "vintage", though on second thought I guess I see why you are pointing out it may not be relevant since AU was probably emphasizing the "recent" in "recent vintage" to say it was new and therefore shouldn't happen. I also disagree with that though I suppose for different reasons.	24
1	Some of the worst parts of the crusades aren't on here, which makes sense because they actually happened. I'm going to blame the upvotes and comments supporting the crusades on most of this sub still being in bed.	24
1	That post is okay I suppose, simplistic in every way though. Obviously a little graphic is going to lack the details. Too many crusade apologists end up taking a stance at the exact opposite end of the bias they claim to be correcting.	24
1	The sidebar is populated by a bot that measures sub activity. The list of related subs is huge, and they need a minimum threshold of activity to be there.	24
1	For a pretty balanced look at the crusades I'd recommend Thomas Asbridge's latest book. He does a good job of presenting the facts without painting either the Muslims or the Christians in too good or bad a light.  [Amazon link.](http://www.amazon.com/Crusades-Holy-Land-Asbridge-Thomas/dp/B00CF6HCTY/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430996734&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=thomas+asbridge)	24
1	The smugness. It hurts.	24
1	yeah the whole list is kind of unimpressive.  We don't "need" it? Well that's just your opinion man. We don't "need" national ice cream month. There's lots of stuff the government does that we don't necessarily need, but which does no real harm either.	24
1	Wasnt there a massive holocaust of European Jews by the crusader masses at the onset of the first crusade? My memory is fuzzy as its been about a decade since I read a couple books.	24
1	I guess we have to consider the opposite, which would be a national day of not believing in God/a higher power and rejecting religion-based reflection. I understand the historical element argument with the rise in atheism in the West pushing predominantly right-wingers to call for this kind of recognition, and I understand the argument against something like this since it's an obvious attempt to promote the idea of the persecuted Christian.   Can't we just be secular and have a Day of Religious Reflection so that we can appreciate the benefits and consider the darker side of religion? I'd like that...	24
1	Yeah, when the crusader army took Jerusalem they slaughtered a large portion of the Jews and Muslims living there. Something about stacks of bodies and rivers of blood.	24
1	Which religion does it establish? And on whom does it establish it?	24
1	That too, but I'm pretty sure he is referring to the [Rhineland Massacres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhineland_massacres). The call for the first crusade led to a lot of violence against jewish communities in France and Germany.	24
1	In conclusion: Holy war is a real thing and bombing the hell out of muslims is OK because they started it 1400 years ago.	24
1	You guys upvote this type of shit and then go on and on about how /r/atheism is horrible  Congratulations, /r/Christianity	24
1	For those that are arguing against this, it should be kept in mind that not all prayer is petitionary - there are prayers of gratitude, silent prayers, etc. Prayer, in its broadest sense, simply means communication with the divine, or the unseen order of things (a la William James).  Also, prayer is not just a Christian thing. Most major world religions have some form of prayer. And if you look at studies, there are even lots of atheists that pray, for the purposes of comfort, relaxation, and reflection.	24
1	Also "recent vintage:"  - marijuana decriminalization/legalization  - gay rights  - civil rights  - abortion rights  - voting rights  ...and yet they get ticked off about and make a big deal out of this one small thing. Some people just love to complain about anything they can.	24
1	Actually, it is.  The prayers opening Congress, etc, have been challenged, and the challenge was dismissed.  Prayer is protected speech.  So is blasphemy, and all atheistic expression.  We don't get to silence others when we don't like what they are saying.	24
1	Doesn't change the fact that prayer in the Court is overwhelmingly Christian, and that Christians have tried to boo down people who try to pray from other religions or from no religion at all.  Overall, the Day of Prayer is just divisive, distracting from important issues, and is a heap more trouble than it's worth. It detracts greatly from the US's original motto of E Pluribus Unum.  EDIT: [Source](http://www.christianpost.com/news/protestors-interrupt-senate-s-first-hindu-led-prayer-28443/)	24
1	Which religion would that be?	24
1	The court has considered all this.  The precedent is clear and established.  I get that you don't like it.  But the Constitution protects the speech of people of faith even though you don't like them.	24
1	The purpose of this NDoP is for the politicians to be seen publicly parading their religious faith about. They would have much more credibility if it was a gathering of individuals from all parties in a closed room, without press releases and speeches before and after.	24
1	Would you be fine with a bureaucratic mess of the government trying to sanction an event for every single religion, no matter how small?  Would you be fine with a government sanctioned month of Ramadan where the *participants* try to force you to participate, or vilify those who don't?	24
1	The same Hindus, Muslims, Jews, and Sikhs also get booed when they try to do it.  Rather than getting into this mess, wouldn't it be simpler if the government just steered clear of it?	24
1	Are you saying you don't want Puffin to think about both sides of an issue?  You do know that's the best way to get trapped in confirmation bias, right?	24
1	You are free to pray. You can pray on TV, in front of a big crowd, I don't care. I would fight for your right to pray in peace, in any capacity you choose, in any number you choose. You could have a day organized by christian churches where christians fill the streets, and sing christian hymns, and pray, I couldn't care less.   But I think it is not right for the government to sanction a day of prayer. The government should have nothing todo with religion whatsoever. It isn't right.	24
1	So how to be the positive example without seeking attention? A difficult task. This atheist is cynical enough to believe that politicians are doing this to gain points with their constituents Otherwise, they would be pastors.	24
1	It wouldn't hurt me if there was a Muslim holiday day.  It doesn't really effect me as long as I am not forced to participate.  I might not like or agree with it but it doesn't harm me or anyone else that elected officials participate in any religious or irreligious activity they want as long as it is not forced on people who don't want to participate. That's why the ruling here was that the plaintiffs had no standing in the case.	24
1	It doesn't take a whole lot of cynicism to think a career politician might do something dishonest to garner voter approval.	24
1	I agree.  The event should not be constitutional. It's hardly fair to have an event that's 90%+ Christian being defended as fair and promoting a diversity of viewpoints when there's only 10% different opinions, and that there is a huge Christian backlash against the 10% that's not Christian.	24
1	Its best to ask your spouse. If she has a problem with it then you have a problem. If there is anything about your relationship or anything that happens that you are not totally at ease talking to your wife about then you have a problem. If there is anything that you can talk to this woman about that you have not or will not talk to your wife about, you have a problem. The rational parts of our brain that keeps boundaries in place and reminds us of consequences tend to shut down around members of the opposite sex. Basically you are walking around in a minefield.	24
1	Your question is impossible to answer. if we knew about them they would not be beings we dont know about.	24
1	Not that I'm looking to die anytime soon, but I kind of hope God takes me home with a little bit of ironic humor.	24
1	People like you are why I stopped going to church.  Too invested in the religion of Christian America to see that there can be any downsides to it.  The only opposition must come from godless communists that "worship" Karl Marx right?	24
1	I changed to this flair as a little joke. The joke was not against Evangelicals. I was part of IVCF in college and have a lot of Evangelical friends. After changing to the flair I found out that an [Evangelical Catholic]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Catholic) is a thing.	24

1	/u/Frankfusion is still on the team I think.  Edit: but shhhh....I think he's sleeping	24
1	&gt;It shouldn't even be about a religion in the first place - it should be about people's personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  What does this even mean? It shouldn't be about a religion... It should be about your relationship with Christ. So you mean... Christianity.	24
1	In general I'd say that a person can be a positive example by just being a good person.  Don't hide your good works, but don't go out of your way to draw attention to them either.  How is that possible when your entire career is about being in the public eye?  I can't even begin to imagine.	24
1	The seljuks started it in Anatolia, but the crusaders ended up attacking the fatimids in the Levant. You can't just lump all muslims governments together	24
1	Some preachers will do anything to drive a point home.	24

1	&gt;**...so that they may see your good works.**   Maybe politicians should worry more about actually doing good over making a stage show of their so-called faith.	24
1	/r/Sidehugs still has a special place in my heart.	24
1	For one my reply was about the comment that there were two possibilities, there are more. Ever heard of the placebo effect? Yes, prayer or meditation or positive thinking can have a beneficial outcome for that person. But that does not show there was an external or supernatural source for it.	24
1	Was anyone recording his sermon ?   I am glad he was doing what he loved when he died.	24
1	How do you all feel about pandas?   I mean, I'm pretty sure that /u/LuluThePanda likes them, but the others have not as of yet stated their opinions on them that I am aware of.  This is a very important question for...reasons.	24

1	And, in contrast, Saint Sisoes the Great prayed on his deathbed to be given a little more time for repentance.  Food for thought.	24
1	You are thinking of Order 65  &gt;"In the event of either (i) a majority in the Senate declaring the Supreme Commander (Chancellor) to be unfit to issue orders, or (ii) the Security Council declaring him or her to be unfit to issue orders, and an authenticated order being received by the GAR, commanders shall be authorized to detain the Supreme Commander, with lethal force if necessary, and command of the GAR shall fall to the acting Chancellor until a successor is appointed or alternative authority identified as outlined in Section 6 (iv)."	24

1	Thank you for being a mod! I know it is and will be taxing, and I know that I wouldn't want to do it. Is there any way we can show our appreciation beyond merely saying thanks?	24
1	That's just simply not true. I mean, you can call things whatever you want and I can't stop you. At the end of the day, the actual beliefs are more important than the labels. But the actual beliefs of 90% of atheists is not "there is no god," it's "I don't believe in a god." And yes, there's a big difference. It's impossible to scientifically state "there is no god." But it *is* scientific to say "there's no evidence for god."	24
1	/u/emprags   Bless that guy's heart	24
1	And what if you want a prayer hour in school every week? Or what if a Muslim wants public schools to provide transportation for a pilgrimage to Mecca? Or what if I want a National Leave Your Religion Day? I don't want any of those things, because it's the government promoting religion, and the same is true for national prayer day.	24
1	The separation of Church and State that the country was founded on was strictly limited to the federal government not sanctioning or restricting religious practice, not exterminating any public expression of religiosity.	24
1	That's really, really sweet of you to say :)  Adding reasons in your reports is super helpful. Sometimes things get reported and the reasons help us see an issue we didn't pick up on.

1	We have theodicy that works in theory, but looks like a hand-wave, and there is no workable *experiential* theodicy, and so we retain faith and hope amid disaster we cannot as humans experientially explain (and when we attempt to do so, we become fools like Dr. Pangloss or Pat Robertson).	24
1	But there are places in between those two, if they want to make sure that the prayers are not official while granting the right to pray	24
1	What group is making it divisive? Gee, I wonder, surely it can't be the group that's trying to force others to adhere to their religious views on abortion, on sex education, on scientific education, on contraceptives, on moral policy, nor is it the same group trying to push people to become Christian and demonize those who aren't. Surely they are not the ones making the day of prayer divisive...	24

1	I don't think the point is that he thought he was capable of repenting enough to atone for his sins. If anything, he was recognizing that despite a lifetime of repentance and asceticism, he wasn't so great that he could claim to have done "enough". You can believe in God's grace and still find repentance valuable and appropriate. We're saved by the grace and mercy of God, but it's still our responsibility to respond to that even if we *are* assured of salvation at the moment of our conversion.	24
1	Hindus, Muslims, Sihks, and Jews have all taken part in the national day of prayer.	24
1	His use of past subjunctive indicates he didn't think it would actually happen.  OTOH, if he had said, "If the Lord *calls* me now ..."  In seriousness, St. John Climacus talks about remembrance of death as a step on the ladder of divine ascent, and quotes Sirach 7:36:  "Remember your last end, and you will never sin."	24
1	For my money, Jesus' response to his buddy Lazarus' death is a far better template for how to respond to grief - our own and others' - than Job, which is often trotted out when we think about grief.	24
1	&gt; "sufferers"  You had to insert a dig in there. You couldn't just say, "this is nice."  Response Edit: Traditionalists think discrimination is when people say, "it's not nice to put down gay people or their ordination" - LGBTQ people think discrimination is being kicked out of your home, given psychological conditions from spiritual/verbal/physical abuse, subjected to lives of poverty and substance abuse, or being murdered.	24
1	You got it, dude! Lord, through the prayers of Saint Basil, give /u/apophis-pegasus the clarity of mind needed to do their very best on their exams!	24
1	Yeah I am a queer person actually; I didn't appreciate it.	24
1	They don't want prayer *on public property*, said by *public officials*, paid for with taxpayer money.  It's fine for people to pray on their own time and in church. That's absolutely not what's at stake here. They don't want religion imposed *in public spaces*.   Besides, I don't think Jesus would have had a problem with the FFRF. After all, Matthew 6:5.	24
1	Frankly, I'm not sure it was ever intended to do anything besides forbid the federal government from creating (a.k.a. establishing) a state religion. There's a great deal of difference between any member of the government being open in their support for a particular religion and creating a state church.	24
1	&gt; ...the federal government not sanctioning... religious practice...  That's precisely what a National Day of Prayer is. It's the federal government sanctioning prayer, which is a religious practice.	24
1	If there is no male or female in Christ, why is the spiritual expression of women so limited compared to the spiritual expression of men?	24
1	Keeping the government out of religion is not godlessness. Banning religion would be godlessness, and no one worth listening to is advocating that.	24

1	According to our wacky paranoid conspiracy theorists, a group of secretly gay (and secretly evil) clergy who, desiring to turn the RCC into a flamboyant 24/7 gay orgy the likes of which even San Francisco has never seen, have insidiously ascended to the halls of power and now control the Vatican, pulling strings from behind the scenes to change Catholic doctrines regarding sexual morality.   I only wish I were making that up.	24

1	&gt; A New Orleans pastor collapsed suddenly and died in the middle of preaching a sermon at *Greater Saint Mary Baptist Church*.....  That's really a thing????	24
1	No, black is still the new black, unfortunately.  Gay people are just also despised by many people.	24
1	I don't think it is unconstitutional either but these types of meetings send conflicting messages. If the politician *really* thinks the most important thing is to preach the salvation message rather than represent his constituents then maybe he should be a pastor. Once a politician starts pushing their faith they lose my vote but I'm sure that is more than compensated by pastors telling their congregation who to vote for.	24
1	Please pray for my wife and I. I've been battling same-sex attraction for a long time and told my wife. She's hurting very deeply. Pray that God may give my wife strength and patience. Pray that God may allow me to die to my sins daily.	24
1	If I were guessing, I'd Saint Mary is a street or a neighborhood or something, given New Orleans' Catholic history. I may or may not look this up.	24

1	Pray that God's will be done, that these men will see the error of their ways, and that they will repent of their violence and hatred; more importantly, that they will repent of their hatred towards God.	24
1	Christian theology is unique in that I'm it's essence it is fundamentally *relational*. The Christian project seeks to ground a politics firmly in the *imago dei* that is not *in se* but *perichoetic*. It eschews our contemporary nominalist biopolitics that can only decouple the self from the ground of being and funds a perverse Dionysian nihilism.	24
1	&gt; I’m simply saying that they are not the doctrines held by the authors whose writings are used to create them.  A better way to put it might be this:  They are doctrines that aren't spelled out fully by every author.	24
1	If a church claims to be "welcoming" of gay people, then it should be somewhere where a gay couple and their children can say, "This would be a good church for our family." I don't think that's going to be the case here. Although I think being LGBT and Christian are perfectly compatible, I'm not going to demand churches that disagree change their view. But I wish they would stop misappropriating the word "welcome."	24
1	The penal substitutionary atonement model of Christological atonement perpetuates the indefensible doctrine of *corprus collosum*, which is to say that it is, in its entirety, a strawman's strawman in terms of feasibility. The justification of Original Sin, then, must likewise be recumbent upon its constituency to provide for its own hermeneutical exegesis and soiterological ontic referent. Therefore, the over-doctrine known in common parlance as *sola scrptura* must be re-evaluated, re-constituted, and re-instituted not as a theological boondoggle of the most insidious nature, but as the inherent basis of analytically-driven eisegesis, be it ecclesiastical or polynumeral eschatology.	24
1	I have a request to add if you don't mind.   Please pray for me. My knot is scrupulosity, anxiety, and a lack of trust.	24
1	&gt; John’s Gospel is just the opposite: it does not have a virginal conception of Jesus. It has Jesus as a pre-existent divine being who becomes incarnate.  I'm sure you're aware of this, but John explicitly states that Jesus is a pre-existent divine being who becomes incarnate through a human woman (even though his gospel doesn't include a nativity).   You're phrasing makes it sound like you think John has Jesus just beaming into our plane of existence...	24
1	Yeah brother! Congratulations! :)  Lutheran church generally felt right to me - I don't agree exactly with everything they say but it's a good fit.  Found out later that my grandparents were Lutheran :) That was cool	24
1	I hope they will realize what they're doing isn't Gods will and they repent.  I would forgive them.	24
1	That was a very good read.	24
1	So a gay couple and their children are welcome in the church as a family?	24
1	So they would just demand that they break up their family and call that welcoming. I'm not really seeing how they are not shaming them here...  Also, nice try with the "at the expense of kids" comment but same sex couples make just as good parents as opposite sex couples. And there is nothing to support "problems in development" being the cause of homosexuality.	24
1	That was a clever way to avoid confronting any of the flaws in your argument whatsoever.	24
1	Eisegeting sounds like the symptom of a persistent STD.	24
1	So, 'welcoming gays' means a couple and their children *aren't* welcome, but feel free to tell them they have a problem that needs to be overcome. Got it.	24
1	The general idea is that salvation is through faith alone, but also that genuine faith in Christ *always* results in "good works". That is, the good works are a result of salvation, not a cause.	24
1	It's actually a pretty good idea. If you just pretend they aren't families, then you can never actually hurt a family. We should just pretend gays aren't people either, then you would never hurt *anyone* and would truly be welcoming to all people! And then just act like your position is so obvious that you don't need to substantiate it! Now you're well on your way to creating your own little bubble where you treat everyone great and can never be wrong.	24
1	By "welcome," I think he means they are welcome to divorce and put their kids up for adoption.	24
1	Early culture around the age of Job shows that the practice was that your closest friends would come and mourn with you, but wouldn't speak until you spoke and were ready.	24
1	&gt; but if you want to be part of the Church you HAVE TO follow the doctrine of the church.   Sure, I agree completely. The part I *disagree* with is claiming this doctrine is somehow 'welcoming'.    You even said that a gay person and his family would "of course not" be welcome.	24
1	What does this book have to do with homosexuality?	24
1	Probably nothing, but hey, at least he responded to you and managed to avoid your questions! /s	24
1	Why can't Tradition be considered a rule of faith as well? Like a regulative principle to interpret Scripture for example.	24
1	&gt; Christian theology is unique in that I'm it's essence  Isn't this giving yourself a little too much credit?	24
1	That's possibly one of the most smug and hurtful responses you possibly could have made there, especially with so few characters.	24
1	Believe me, people such as Pat Robertson, Ken Ham, Creflo Dollar, Ted Cruz (well 80% of the Republican party, really) do a much, much better job alienating youth from Christianity than this joke page could ever hope to do.	24
1	My daughter is fighting a mighty battle with brain cancer.  I already want to punch the next idiot that tells me "everything happens for a reason", or "God doesn't give you more than you can handle".  I would rather have you not say anything at all.	24
1	I don't read Dawkins. He's kind of a militant, pretentious douche to be honest. Also, I thought you weren't commenting anymore...	24
1	I think saying that someones family is unacceptable and needs to be dissolved is inducing shame.	24
1	&gt; not sanctioning or restricting religious practice  And a National Day of Prayer isn't sanctioning religious practice? Because that seems exactly what it is.	24
1	These will be in English. A cut and paste from a theology text would be in German	24
1	This would be good for everyone who wants to discuss GSM to read, not just straight Christians.  Edit: I feel what I said can be easily misconstrued.

1	Sounds like good advice. 10/10 would approve again.	24

1	A lot of people dying in agony and praying for help but THIS guy gets God's attention so he can pass a chemistry test. Oh glory.	24
1	I'm curious why he concluded it was God, though. Regardless of what he promised God, if I were the Evil One, I think it might amuse me to put people in positions they weren't ready for.  Doctors who should have failed chemistry. Engineers who should have failed math. Housecleaners who mix bleach with ammonia. It begins!	24
1	I like that, I like that. start slow, pretty comprehensible, but then as you go on you're eventually staring down a block of theological head cheese.	24
1	I mean, I aced my chemistry final but it was by perseverance and a profound sense of personal responsibility. It hardly seems fair that Ben Carson, a medical doctor, got the cheat codes.	24
1	&gt;But what can I do to to help him become a nicer person and the sweet little boy I miss so much?”  You know when Pat Roberson, of all people, has to point out to you that your child is a preteen on the cusp of puberty and not a "sweet little boy" anymore that you are pretty oblivious.	24
1	Your comment really is not a direct reflection of the article, and I can't see why you would share this information but to instigate a fight.	24
1	My hope, is that you'll never say anything. Only show up when you are needed, give a stern look, and vanish into the night. But when you leave, a peace, a sort of calm, overcomes the sub. For we know, that you are always watching.	24
1	&gt;music that speaks of ‘the beat within’ and the ‘infection in people,’  Okay.  Of *all* the objectionable sorts of music that are out there, *that* is worth beating a child over?  Hell, just turn those into talking points about conscience and sin.  Done.	24
1	I don't think anyone is trying to exterminate public displays of religion.  I think they oppose this because it is the government sanctioning a religious event/celebration, which violates the separation of church and state.	24
1	No 1 should be how US churches are **NOT** at risk of "being forced" to perform gay weddings. They've never been forced to marry (or even accept) interracial couples and this civil rights issue will be no different in that respect.	24
1	&gt; But articles like this make the problem worse, not better.  No, it's just people like you who make the problem worse. I honestly read that thinking that it was kind of ridiculous that anyone would be need to be told these extremely obvious things. Little did I know there would be someone to refute the idea of treating people with the most basic amount of respect and simply understanding the basic facts about homosexuality.	24

1	Here are a ton of [search results](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/search?q=Are+Catholics+Christian+&amp;restrict_sr=on) affirming that Catholics are Christian, they don't worship Mary over Jesus, and worship the same God you and I do.	24

1	This is unfortunately very common in Mexico.	24
1	But you've never participated in this subreddit.	24
1	Are you:  A. A psychologist.  B. A neuroscientist.  C. A doctor.  If none of the above, you likely have absolutely no place arguing against the accepted scientific standpoint simply because you don't agree with it.	24
1	There are also plenty of people who seriously engage Scripture and come to the conclusion that same-sex relationships are ok.	24
1	Love this. As a bisexual who has maintained my sexual purity more than most straight Christians (25 year old virgin, never had a porn habit), I get really mad at some of the assumptions people make about Christians who experience same-sex attractions.   And that statement about my sexual purity isn't out of pride or some attempt to win the moral high ground. God knows that I have sinned plenty. But we need to show that it's possible for an LGBT person to be chaste without undergoing sexually repressive psychotherapy first.	24
1	"Nurture" traditionally refers to your parents and home environment, not conscious individual choice.  We don't, to the best of my knowledge, get to pick our parents.  If you can choose whether or not you're attracted to everyone you meet, either you're an extreme outlier or an amazingly unfussy bisexual - or both. ;)	24
1	Good for you! That takes a lot of strength. Glad you do not let it affect your Faith.	24
1	&gt;In fact, we dabble in things because have identity crisis.  I have been attracted exclusively to men literally since I was aware of what sex is. While physical attraction may be a choice for you, it certainly isn't for me.	24
1	So, when did you decide to be straight?	24
1	Opinions are for subjective things, like the quality of the Avengers movie or that blueberry scone. Whether sexuality is a choice is not subjective and therefore there's no need to have an opinion on it.	24
1	Please. I'm all for a more GSM-friendly Christianity, but appealing to nature isn't going to win anyone over to our side. The killing of partners and offspring is found in many species, but we don't let that fly for humans.	24
1	If you find that you like it, then you're not straight.  If you find you don't like it, you're straight.  Of course *having gay sex* is a choice.	24
1	Your comment is absolutely useless without elaboration...	24
1	How would things have worked out for blacks in the 1800's, or mid 1900's if we just didn't talk about it?	24
1	Either post some peer reviewed evidence that homosexuality is a choice, go off and conduct your dabbling experiment and let us know if you came down with a nasty case of the gays or quit sticking your bigoted, homophobic nose in business it doesn't belong.	24
1	If it's a For-Profit business it's a legal grey area. If it's a non-profit (like a church), then yeah, that's illegal as hell.	24
1	Agreed.  The "but it occurs in nature" argument is way too easy to pick apart because nature is brutal. We really shouldn't compare ourselves to animals when talking about moral issues.	24
1	&gt; Im almost absolutely sure that no neuroscientist has come out with data that implies sexual aptitude through adolescence  You'd be wrong. There's a number of neuroscience studies demonstrating morphological differences between sexual orientations.  &gt;and fuck is psychology even a science?  Yes.  &gt;If you aint fucking with gods word in regards to homosexuality why would you act like you serve him?   "fucking with gods word" is a prequisite to serve him?  &gt; Half stepping Christians apologizing for sinners, shit is disgusting.  I don't think homosexuality is disgusting. That you find it so is merely your opinion.	24
1	It means that you are okay being called racial slurs that most people consider inappropriate in regular society.	24
1	I'm not so certain that same-sex behavior is a choice.  Each individual expression of it is a choice I'll grant, but I don't believe celibacy for life is within the power of everyone.  I know that I would have zero% chance of suppressing my heterosexuality for life.  I've successfully channeled it into a single monogamous married relationship, but I'm certain that suppressing my sexuality for life would be impossible.	24
1	&gt;Doesn't matter what you think. You will discover very abruptly that you were mistaken after death. What happens after that is your own fault.  You understand, of course, that the members of the cult you're condemning would say exactly the same thing to both of us, right?  Why should I take your warning seriously but completely disregard theirs?	24
1	[There are some studies that begin to suggest a genetic explanation](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/14/genes-influence-male-sexual-orientation-study), but it's not definitive at this point. However, regardless of the cause of homosexuality, I believe Christians are called to love, serve, and reach out to all people, not just those whose morals we agree with. When I think about my friends who are gay and not Christians I don't see someone repulsive whom I need to defend society from, I see a person no more sinful than myself who I want to share the love of Christ with.	24
1	How often do you get called those things?	24
1	&gt; The same town is also passing laws to force all churches to perform homosexual weddings.  I try not to be so rude, but I just don't believe you. I've never heard anyone honestly suggest forcing a church to perform any sort of wedding.	24
1	Wtf does polyamory even have to do with this subject? It's a complete red herring.	24
1	So why do people with parents who don't support being gay become gay? They certainly weren't groomed that way, and "made a choice" that risks them being rejected and disowned.	24
1	This comment crosses over into secular hatred of gays, and as such is covered by point 1.3's stricture against homophobia, and I'll ask you to lighten up on the vitriol in the future.  &gt; The last paragraph crosses the line.  This report on your comment is correct.	24
1	Paul was hardly illiterate.	24
1	Well, not in the US. It's a legitimate concern in countries with state churches.	24
1	I mean, assuming that's true, that's still not chosen. It's nurture rather than nature, but that's not the same as a choice.	24
1	"One man makes implications that possibly support my own view regardless of how many people say otherwise so I must be right."  And lol at "blocked by the homosexuals". The Jews run wall street and the president is an alien.  "The gays did this!"	24
1	&gt; shoddy science  The irony is delicious  &gt; ALL homosexuals  It is sufficient to claim that some or many had no choice.  &gt; identity crisis.   If somebody wants to get with the same sex solely because they're having an identity crisis, they're not gay. If they actually are attracted to the same sex, they're gay. How is this relevant?	24
1	That's called privilege, buddy	24
1	what's the propaganda?  it is not saying that anyone needs to believe that homosexuality is not a sin, it is just an article trying to help everyone speak in ways that love and build up others.	24
1	In Denmark where I live the churches can't refuse to marry same-sex couples. The priest can though, and this is fine to me but the problem is that all the other employees at the church can't. This means that my father who is a caretaker at the church and helps out with all the practical stuff at a service, will most likely be fired if he refuses to help at such a wedding. And he will refuse. It's actually sort of frightening to my family. Så I think that would be a nice law to have.	24
1	What do you mean?  I don't see any liberal propaganda here.  Please point out to me the part of this post that is liberal propaganda.	24
1	It's not just preaching against a single sin. It would be all the Sunday morning televangelists decrying your sin as the death and destruction of western civilization. I can still remember Jerry Falwell hawking videos of just how bad Bill Clinton was—he even attended a gay inauguration ball (not to mention murdering Vince Foster, but that's another of his videos).  You'd like to dismiss this as just plain crazy that no one would believe. But, in 2004, many states used anti-gay rhetoric to drive Republicans to the polls. The fact that they took equality away from gay people was just the collateral damage.	24
1	&gt;Good article.  It all boils down to Matthew 22:36-40.   That's pretty much how I treat everything. Anytime someone pulls out a few verses to explain their actions or theology, I ask "Does this show love to God, does this show love to other people?  You'd be surprised how much "biblical" teaching doesn't fit that criteria.	24
1	&gt; I don't think you should anthropomorphise God because He/She/It is infinite and divine.  I think you may be fundamentally misunderstanding Christianity.  You are right that **we** can't anthropomorphize God.  The scandal of Christianity is that **God** anthropomorphized himself.  Based on what you wrote, it sounds like you are looking for something outside the realm of Christianity.  I don't know that much about non-Christian religions, but that sort of thing may be compatible with Buddhism, neo-Paganism, or possibly Unitarianism.  However, I would encourage you to give Christianity another shot before jumping ship - perhaps a different tradition than Catholicism.	24
1	He has some serious skills! It looks great, what translation did he use?	24
1	That's pretty cool. I'd even own a copy of that. Good work!	24
1	&gt; blasphemes the words of Christ  Christ didn't say a word about the issue. He said divorce was wrong, He said willful lust was wrong, and He said lots of other things, but He never addressed the issue of same-gender relationships.   Some will argue that *none* of the Scriptures address same-gender relationships as we know them today, but that's an entirely different discussion; I'm just pointing out that the words of Christ wouldn't be blasphemed no matter what attitude someone has towards LGBT relationships. (Well, unless you don't love the people involved - because He specifically says to love people - even enemies.)	24
1	Thank you! Christian Community Bible is the translation used.	24
1	He would love to see a print version of course, although given the challenges of making a 1500 page full colour book, that might be unlikely...  But, I spent the last 6 months making an iPad app of it, I'm going to tell him that it's been finished on his 80th birthday this Sunday.	24
1	This is so beautiful. Please post again when the app comes out! Do you know what it will be called on the App Store?	24
1	Now thats a great retirement project.	24
1	It's not though, many denominations believe in the Harrowing of Hell.	24
1	This is simply amazing. I don't really know what to add because woah.	24
1	Hey.  This is very special.  It reminds me of the art in this museum: http://www.avam.org/our-visionaries/howard-finster.shtml Is there a reason your father began this project?   Why did he decide to do this?	24
1	I was just mentioning yesterday that we need more art on the sub. This is beautiful.	24
1	do you think you will be putting it on android as well?	24
1	Find a publisher and possibly publish it in individual books or small collections. I'd happily buy a book or two of this and you could make good money that way. I know that isn't the goal, but it is the natural result of providing this much value to the world. Seriously consider having individual books published.	24
1	There are people that this celibacy works for, and there are people for whom it did not.  I believe this is rather explicitly stated in the bible.  I'm one for whom it would not.  I don't expect every LGBT is.	24
1	Even the Bible acknowledges that celibacy is hard and not for everyone, see 1 Corinthians 7.	24
1	Murder and assault are also very different, but violence is violence and it's wrong. Discrimination is discrimination and it's wrong. Are we lynching gay men and women? No. Does that mean we can't learn from our past and realize how harmful discrimination is to people groups? No.	24
1	[Ignore my dumbness! There is too much blood in my caffeinestream and the balance has not yet been restored!]	24
1	Amazing - and a huge breadth of both artistic talent and craftsmanship.  I've thought about doing something like this. Hand transcribing the Bible like monks of old, adding my own illustrations (I'm a graphic designer and illustrator) but it always seems so daunting. 10 years? That's substantial.  Beautiful work!	24
1	Finding a gift for my wife's first Mother's Day.	24
1	Yes, children don't generally become parents. People who have spent ten years on something are generally speaking more than ten years old.  Excellent deduction.	24
1	Not being sick. First weekend I can say that in what feels like forever. Washing all of the things with the brand new wash machine our apartment folks just installed  (two months after the last one self-destructed and flooded the apartment). Maybe going to the farmer's market.	24
1	My point was just that even back then Paul was saying "Man, celibacy is tough, so you might as well get married." It's not like high sex drives and intense desire for intimacy is a new phenomenon.   Lumping homosexuality in with the standard "liberal media is leading the world into depravity" is an easy but false connection.	24
1	Husband comes home todayyyyyyyy!!!	24
1	Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me a sinner.	24
1	I'll get around to more sermon doodles once I conquer my procrastination.  ^(Maybe tomorrow.)	24
1	Former print shop employee here.  Yes, they can do something like this - probably publish as an anthology of individual books, like children's books.  Some christian publishers to approach:  http://www.tyndale.com/  http://www.zondervan.com/  [Claretian Publications](http://www.shrineofstjude.org/site/PageServer?pagename=pub_homepage) (they created the CCB translation - I'd talk to them first)	24
1	Amazing. Get it published.   And have him do an AMA on here	24
1	Please make an android app so I don't have to go buy an ipad just for this.	24
1	30% of heterosexuals are obese.  When are straight people going to leave that disgusting and depraved "heterosexual lifestyle" /s	24
1	It's available now actually. It has a very long name.... http://appstore.com/theholybiblehandwrittenandillustratedbydinomazzoli	24
1	You serious? Haha, it is like asking why people travel if they could watch documentaries instead	24
1	Look up publishing costs and try a kickstarter. Id buy a copy and im sure many here would support it.	24
1	Yes the entire thing, along with 5000 illustrations...	24
1	AMA is a great idea, thanks!	24
1	Humour aside, fantastic work.	24
1	Nah no attack, I know. :)  It can be sinful because one of the aspects of Christian marriage is (or should be) physical intimacy. If done over a long term, it becomes selfish and hurtful.  Marital rape is a real thing and it's just as abhorrent and unconscionable as any other kind of rape. One spouse withholding sex is **never** a reason for the other to use force or coercion. Any abuse (sexual, physical, emotional, spiritual) of another person is always evil and never justifiable.	24
1	&gt; God designed sex as a complementary heterosexual act, but self-stimulated sex is a personal homosexual act.  This one seems desperate. I mean they all do, but this one especially. When people try to legitimately say things that seemed like good insults at 14 before they realized they were bad, its probably pretty dubious.	24
1	That's because Denmark has a state church. The US has separation of church and state.	24
1	Seriously OP, look into this. You've got a sale from me for sure. I bet you could sell 100 copies in this sub without breaking a sweat.	24
1	You can just search "Mazzoli" and it comes right up though!	24
1	This is pretty incredible. Heck, even I'D buy a copy. Its beautiful.	24
1	Dont bother with a kickstarter for this - its too good. Go to publishers directly.	24
1	If you're gonna have a Bible around (and religious or not it's not a bad idea to have one, Bible as literature is really interesting stuff) it might as well look this amazing.	24
1	I don't think it's fair to make sweeping generalizations like this.	24
1	What is a true Christian? What is a false Christian?	24
1	Sadly, both parties have used Christianity to push forward an agenda. Don't give all the power over to one side.	24
1	Fair to anyone. It's not fair to the people you're stereotyping, it's not fair to the people reading your question because you're giving them incomplete information and most of all, it's not fair to *you* to have such black-and-white thinking about things. Open yourself to nuance! Explore your statements-are they truly accurate? can you find any cases where what you're saying might not be the case?	24
1	It's not a bad question-asking why a political party uses church teaching to push an agenda is a perfectly good question! Your implications, however, aren't so appropriate.	24
1	There *are* bad questions. Loaded questions like the first sentence of your post force answerers to accept your premise that Republicans aren't true Christians.	24
1	If we take it down to the basest level, it looks like: "there's another group of people who *claim* to be like my group of people, but really they do weird stuff and think weird things that look *nothing* like our things and I just don't like it." Dealing with The Other is sometimes hard, and this kind of thing happens really frequently with just about anything.  I think Orthodoxy would get more of this from Baptists too, if more of them knew we existed ;)	24
1	dat Epistle of James tho...sure, The RCC is wrooooong.	24
1	How do you get married to someone if you're not allowed to date? If that's impertinent I'm sorry, just ignore me. I'm really curious how that works.	24
1	Some (maybe even most) of the greatest Saints were single. Single doesn't mean "dying/living alone". When it is best lived out, it's meant to be pursuing celibacy for the sake of Christ. Many Saints didn't wish to be married because of how that might have turned their attention to things not of God (St Paul for instance was a supporter of this).	24
1	&gt; Obviously you get to know the person before you propose to them,   So, like you eat meals together, talk, that sort of thing?	24
1	If you make celibacy about merely not having sex, it's not worth pursuing. From your words and tone, you seem to have a proper idea as to what celibacy actually means; that it's a positive, active thing, not just a lack of sex. This is good. Keep that up. There are also several people who frequently use this subreddit in a very similar boat to you.	24
1	Christians who believe gay people are called to celibacy are often called "side B" Christians (as opposed to side A who believe monogamous same-sex relationships to be good, and side X who believe all same-sex attraction is sin). I admittedly know very little about the communities of side B Christians, but you can check out https://www.gaychristian.net/sideb.php for a community of others who do believe that way, if you're interested.  Edit: If you ever need somebody to talk to, rant to, etc, don't hesitate to PM me.	24
1	&gt; because I do hope to get marrow to a woman some day  Great way to make a woman miserable.	24
1	We did explore some options for publishing after it was finished, and there was some interest, but nothing concrete came of it. I figured making an App might be a good way to garner some interest for it, and then after we could look again at publishing options. Thanks lots for this though, will definitely look into it.	24
1	He doesn't want to be celibate and he doesn't want to remain single.	24
1	&gt; I can't get past my addiction  I don't know how to say this nicely but you need professional help.  This is very common scenario and there are professionals who are trained specifically to help people in your situation.	24
1	I've been in the same situation. You will be alright. There may be challenging parts ahead, but you will be alright whatever happens because God doesn't let go.	24
1	If the guy is "thirsting" (as he puts it) for intimacy and burning with passion, I'm pretty sure celibacy ain't his vocation.	24
1	&gt; You're not a Christian, so don't tell Christians what our God is like when you don't even believe in him..  /u/Dolphins3 was a Christian for quite a long time.	24
1	No. But I guess if you squint hard enough, you can find signs of demonic activity in a cookbook.  Devil's Food Cake? Unclean!	24
1	And don't forget that Underwood Deviled Ham. Has the devil's picture right there on the can. :)	24
1	I served deviled eggs at Easter...I'm a monster.	24
1	If frozen is demonic, then Lord of the Rings is demonic too. That sucks.	24
1	Well, it was written by a Catholic,   #**GASP!**	24
1	What does your mother think about The Chronicles of Narnia?	24
1	&gt; We have a very different understanding of what it means to be a Christian.   I don't want to speak too much for Dolphins but he did accept Jesus Christ as his lord and savior. Just like you. That is what makes Christians Christians.   It is never a smart idea to start pulling the "No True Scotsman" card by the way either.	24
1	Noooooooo..... ^^^^SHHH ^^^^don't ^^^^let ^^^^them ^^^^know ^^^^our ^^^^secret	24
1	Aww, whoops. Don't tell the Pope.	24
1	No, it's delightful.	24
1	It's such a cute movie! I don't get why people on reddit shit all over it every chance they get.	24
1	Its demonic in the fact that the damn songs get stuck in your head for months at a time and that the level of commercialization for Frozen is astronomical. I'm surprised Disney didn't team up with KY and make Frozen^TM condoms	24
1	I liked it.  But I actually liked Tangled better than Frozen, there I said it.	24
1	We had deviled sausages for dinner the other night (and on toast for breaky the next day)	24
1	&gt; I believe that there is a difference between genuine faith given by God and the false faith of false professors,  How do you distinguish between the two?	24
1	Fluidity of sexual orientation does not necessarily imply divine intervention. The world isn't divided into gay/straight.	24
1	No.  Its melodic.	24
1	I never meant to come off like that. Sorry. I'm not of the opinion that celibacy is a possibility for everyone. I just wanted to approach the poster accepting the idea that he was capable.	24
1	&gt; if I didn't have to wait ten minutes between comments, but I have the timer on my acc so I won't  Yeah having -100 will do that.  Shoot me a PM if you'd like.	24
1	Who would want to put something on their penis that was called Frozen?	24
1	Do you wanna build a snowman?	24
1	Mulan is still the best.	24
1	I believe /u/TheEpicofGilgasmegma was referring how you stated you want to "marrow" a woman, nor "marry".	24
1	You know, if that's how you want to play it, that's your business.  But since you're asking, have you ever had any real exposure to Christian communities who are accepting of gay people and think that there's nothing sinful about living in a committed, monogamous, gay relationship?  There are whole denominations and churches who support gay marriage and the ordination of gay ministers and who don't see anything wrong with being gay so long as you follow the same rules as straight people.  If that isn't something you have much exposure to, it's worth visiting an affirming church and understanding what that experience might be like.	24
1	To be honest, it actually has a really good message about self-sacrifice and love. It kinda seems like I've heard something like it somewhere before...	24
1	There's an entire community of celibate homosexual Christians. They're very supportive of each other.  [Here's an example of one of these ministries.](http://www.christopheryuan.com/main/index.html)	24
1	Assuming it was irrefutable, I'd convert. Although the polytheistic version would cause me a lot more trouble.	24
1	There seems to be this idea nowadays that "dating" implies "meeting up for casual sex".   I have asked the Muslim subs "How do Muslims get married if they can't date" a couple times and every response is "pre-marital sex is not allowed!" instead of stating why two people can't have a meal together.	24
1	Holy untenable mash-up of misunderstood philosophical positions, Batman!	24
1	Destruction of someone else's property is not an appropriate response.	24
1	And it is also interesting that we have become so divorced from the true nature of the cross (that it is a instrument of torture and death) that we are using it for decoration or as an innocuous design element. I think the Catholics have the right idea with the crucifix. It's harder to ignore when there is a dying man hanging from it.	24
1	[I find this cross, used by the pope I believe, especially striking.](http://www.novusordowatch.org/_Media/brokencross-double_med.jpeg)	24
1	"Science and philosophy have disproven the concept of an eternal universe."  They most certainly haven't.	24
1	The first part is reeeeaaally passive aggressive. Better to ignore it.	24
1	You can make that argument for a great many of movies. The last church I was a part of made that case with The Matrix.	24
1	I recall he talked about his faith changing / losing his faith / changing how he thought of it. **Not** "pretending to be a Christian to promote homosexuality".	24
1	My problem with it is that it implies that those who are still gay haven't tried hard enough, or haven't followed God enough.  It bothers me personally because it implies that after years of anguish, prayer, and doing everything I could to follow God and change my sexuality, I am still gay. To have somebody who *isn't* gay tell me how to "fix myself" hurts. I believe it is statements like these that are pushing LGBT people away from the church, as I know it sure did for me.	24
1	I don't understand. Are you talking about Eve?	24

1	Part of the problem is that many churches or other faith communities put forth motherhood as the *sole* path to Christian womanhood, and this tends to be more overt on Mother's Day than any other Sunday.  I remember hearing a sermon once to the effect of "giving birth is part of God's plan for every woman," which is simply not true.  This doesn't mean that mothers shouldn't be recognized, but it does mean that pastors should be careful to not exclude non-mothers from Christendom.	24
1	I take it you dont believe in Universalism.	24
1	&gt; However, when we get to heaven, we'll be completely sanctified and have the same desires as God, so him imposing his wrath on sinners will give us great joy   Does he have scriptural evidence that supports this? That sounds vaguely brainwashy.	24
1	&gt;They do that to every fast growing movement  So did the Romans :p	24
1	I do not although i wish it were true  I find it hard to find bible verses that explicitly show that God will save everyone. I feel like the bible emphasizes the eternal punishment of sinners more	24
1	Well, it is ideally a lot better than me being barbequed forever. However, I still think it is unfair of a supposedly all loving God to destroy my soul, simply because I could not believe in him without sufficient evidence, despite knowing a lot more about Christianity than many of the Christians I know in my life, and actually trying to put effort into understanding the faith. Whereas others will be sent to the eternal skyland because they *could* believe him.	24
1	That's predictions about the world in general. It's true that in western countries many Christians are leaving the faith to become part of the 'unaffiliated' group, but elsewhere across the world Christianity is pretty much holding their own, or even growing significantly, such as in China.	24
1	These sorts of thoughts give me chills too. I don't want to be transformed into something that rejoices at the eternal torment of those who just happened to have picked the wrong religion, but were otherwise no better or worse than those who picked the right one.	24
1	&gt; My question is, (knowing none of you can be right/authoritative on this), in your opinions, what does a christian make?  For a great part of Christendom the [creed Nicene] serves as a Statement of Faith.	24
1	I already enjoy when this happens, so there's that.	24
1	Assuming being gay is a sin.	24
1	You said it! Those fronthuggers have it comin'.	24
1	To be fair, the Romans had a special dislike for Christians because tye considered them "nonparticipating" citizens.	24
1	Simply being something is a sin?	24
1	I live in a country "overrun" with Christians. It ain't peaches and cream. Then again, you can say that for every minority/majority split.	24
1	Ahh, taking a leaf out of Malaysia's book are we?  [A few weeks back a church was asked to take down it's cross because the local Muslims were afraid of losing their faith.](http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/taman-medan-church-still-unsure-about-putting-cross-despite-mbs-assurance)	24
1	i could change my moniker to "idiot_that_no_one_should_take_seriously" and people still wouldn't get the hint	24
1	You are born gay. You arent born alcoholic.	24
1	Being born as something is a sin?	24
1	I highly doubt some man will say "Im gonna start being attracted to guys, just like that!"	24
1	All churches tolerate sin. They'd be empty if they didn't.	24
1	Your friend is mistaken.  God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked and neither will we.  Ezekiel 33:11.	24
1	There are genes that make you *susceptible* to alcoholism. There is a difference.	24
1	Depends. Are the muslims and christians nice people? Do they understand the importance of the separation of church and state? Do they understand that religion is a personal choice, not one to be shoved down each others throats?  And most importantly, do they understand that religion does not speak to the character of other people? I'd rather have a Muslim who lives peacefully with their neighbors than a Christian who asks  "would you rather have christians or muslims".	24
1	No, as long as you do not use writing as a way to indulge in evil and sin, such as writing murder and sex to satisfy your own baser desires, you are fine.  After all, John Milton wrote the mother of all quasi-biblical fanfics, and we praise him for it.	24
1	Have you read anything by Ted Dekker? He writes horror.   C. S. Lewis wrote Sci Fi.  I am sure both of these men were sinful, however I don't think their books were part of that.	24
1	Ooh. Please make a post aboit the seventh day adventists. I know they like to be vegetarian.	24
1	Not at all. Fiction has given Christians a creative outlet since time immemorial. And frankly I think we need more Christians writing science fiction...too much of it presents a future where human religion has ceased to exist, or become so marginal as to be unworthy of mention. As a Christian reader, that always annoys me (and is unrealistic).	24
1	In the Orthodox Christian understanding, the experience of God's love *is* hell for those who hate him.	24
1	When I lived in San Diego the weekly alternative paper had a column from a guy who would visit a different church every week and write about it.  You might find this of interest or inspiration:  http://m.sandiegoreader.com/news/sheep-and-goats/?templates=mobile	24
1	They are born gay.	24
1	You should switch around the Jehovah's Witnesses and Eastern Orthodox, so you can experience Pascha! Sure, it's May 1st next year, but make an exception.   Edit: I see many agree with me. So what will it be, OP?	24
1	He is one of the reasons I started going again.	24
1	I was raised Southern Baptist, became an atheist as a teenager. I wouldn't learn anything I didn't hear for a decade as a child. Same reason I'm not visiting a Mormon church....I have Mormons in my family, already know the gist of it.	24
1	Being an alcoholic isn't sinful, consuming too much alchol is.   Being straight/lgbt isn't sinful, over indulging on sex is.	24
1	Just drop it man.  Get your Islamaphobia out of here, we are taught to love our neighbours, not segregate and generalize them	24
1	Read St. Isaac.  This is horrible theology which twists the love of God into something it is not.	24
1	&gt;His response was that we as sinners are not fully sanctified, therefore the thought of somebody we love suffering in hell is repulsing. However, when we get to heaven, we'll be completely sanctified and have the same desires as God, so him imposing his wrath on sinners will give us great joy  That honestly just sounds fucking insane.	24
1	One of the problems with the growth of Islam is that quite a few Islamic nations refuse to recognize you leaving the faith or threaten you with jail time or death.  This makes a very clear problem when trying to understand what it's true growth is.	24
1	Veggie Tales. it's great for kids!  She might be a bit too old for it, though	24
1	Take her to church?  I feel like movies, especially Christian movies, kind of suck in terms of learning about stuff 9 times out of 10. Your time would be better spent finding some books, reading the Bible, and as I said above taking her to church.	24
1	Not too surprising, I don't think anyone actually thought TEC wouldn't baptize the child.  Edit: On an unrelated note, I think the Episcopal Church should have a council of nine bishops to discuss issues facing the church. That way I could refer to said council as TEC-9	24
1	Around here, we call this Prince Vladimir-ing.	24
1	Never too old for Veggie Tales.	24
1	April's church is not a church. It's a kingdom Hall. You're cheating. You owe us another month.   /s	24
1	Please leave the modding to the mods. If you think he's spamming, report it.	24
1	This isn't a bait thread, it's the resolution to a case in which a church refused to baptize a child.	24
1	This whole situation has been very weird.  I just don't understand any of what has gone on.  Regardless of beliefs about sexuallity, why would any church refuse to baptize a child of parishioners in good standing?  The parents letter doesn't really clear anything up.  And then there's this:  &gt;Some may question why we are choosing to return to the Cathedral. We are returning because we still have faith in the goodness of people  That's a very odd reason to return to a church.	24
1	And we all know how that ended. I'm encouraging this!	24
1	I'm pretty sure that this is the reason religious families have so many children. Now I can use "I'm watching TV with the kiddos" as an excuse to watch veggie tales!	24
1	Or just downvote and move on.	24
1	No Southern Baptist? No fried chicken and  potato salad?!	24
1	Ironically it came up on the report queue earlier and I approved it.	24
1	Mod confirmed as Lavender Mafia!	24
1	I hope you have a pleasant experience at the UU service. There's literally no way to predict what the service will be about, ha.  Edit:  I consider my self agnostic, and I attend a Unitarian church that is very Humanist, but there's a *lot* of diversity across the country. Some are practically secular assemblies, others are very Christian or even earth-centered (like Wicca). Maybe you know this already, but I just wanted to point it out in case.	24
1	I approved it too! We must be twins!	24
1	And Roman Catholic with Church of God, for pretty much the same reason. (Except our Easter actually is in March, unlike your barely-not-in-April Pascha)	24
1	Anyone who takes pleasure in the suffering of others is a psychopath.	24
1	To conquer the grave and establish the New Covenant, and avenues whereby we can become sanctified, become implements of honorable use, and be saved from the humiliating, agonizing, but equitable and corrective punishment we're due.	24
1	I read it as why they are returning to the Cathedral vs another parish church.	24
1	I'm guessing that the people who wanted the church to refuse to baptize the child think that a gay couple shouldn't be considered "parishioners in good standing."  Regarding their "faith in the goodness of people," I thought that was meant to explain why they're returning to that particular cathedral rather than finding a new congregation. It sounds like their might have been some unpleasant interactions with other parishioners, but they have faith in the goodness of the people in this particular church community.	24
1	4% on a population of 1.3 billion is quite a lot of people. Before 1950 Christians seem to have made up less than 1% of the population.	24
1	Be sure the Orthodox church is canonical. Wouldn't want to wander into some old calendar sect.  Rule of thumb is avoid churches with True, Genuine, or Holy in the name.  Also might want to go OCA or Antiochean, cause those usually have a better chance of being in English.	24
1	Church hopping is not such a good way to meet people. Unless you go to the Church's social events. The Christian Church is about deep roots an community, so popping in is not the best way to check it out.   Just to see different services is coll though. I look forward to the write up.	24
1	I would just like to urge people who come to this thread not to downvote comments, even if you really really disagree with them. Even if you think it is factually wrong, it contributes to the discussion, so it does not warrant a downvote.	24
1	Proof that doesnt come from answers in genesis?	24
1	Neanderthals were hominids, but they were not human.  We were closely related, but not human.	24
1	Is there anything necessarily different about the construction and appearance of a wedding cake meant for a heterosexual couple vs a homosexual couple?	24
1	No, they are incompatible.   Christianity teaches us that in order to reach heaven we must follow christ and be willing to be transformed into his image.  Also, reincarnation is not possible... man is destined to have one life, death, and then judgement.	24
1	How about a Baptist church?	24
1	So Christian bakers necessarily put references to religion on all of their wedding cakes, regardless of the desires of their customers?  Additionally, does that mean Christian bakers refuse wedding cakes to people who aren't in the Christian religion getting married? As that would be sanctioning a wedding that isn't involving the Christian religion?  Lastly, how important is one's honor in Christianity?	24
1	I would suggest replacing the Kingdom Hall with a Messianic Jewish congregation.	24
1	(Sees title)   Oh God, this is it. This is going to be the end of the sub. Some guy is going to spout some insults at the atheists here and tear this sub apart.  (Clicks)  .....That ...wow. I am way to paranoid.	24
1	Ya know, you'd think God would abandon us because of the massacre of the Indians, slavery, provoking war in third-world countries, income inequality, or institutionalized racism.  But no, it's porn, women's lib, and buttsecks.	24
1	Wow, I'm so sorry you have to hide your atheism from your family. Thanks for being here, we're glad to have you!	24

1	Thanks, it's something I've just come to grips with for the most part. Only sucks when I have to sit through those painful dinners where they discuss those "stupid atheists trying to burn the country down".	24
1	This is good advice. The Antiochian Archidiocese and OCA Archdiocese both have websites where you can search for a parish. This is recommended.	24
1	&gt; "stupid atheists trying to burn the country down"  ... aha... much becomes clear.  Yeah, *that* kind of Christian is not going to make Jesus' presence very evident.  Er, forgive me for speaking disrespectfully about your parents?  I'm sure they're nice people otherwise?	24
1	Oh yeah, absolutely. I'm lucky to have them all in all, they're very supportive of (almost) everything I do. I don't see any disrespect in what you said, it's a valid point, and I think we all can get in a bad habit of saying things we shouldn't when we're in particularly like-minded company. /r/atheism is an example of that.	24
1	Pfffft. Those slaveholders were just misguided Christians. Gays and feminists? Hellbound pagans!!	24
1	Yeah.  There's been a couple times where what I said was out of line.  I left it up, but replied with an apology.	24
1	WOAH. I MEANT TO SAY MUM. Haha. this is embarassing.	24
1	I'd recommend a traditional silent Quaker meeting. They're definitely a lot different than the other churches you listed, and they tend to be SUPER nice.	24
1	Casseroles yes, Baptist theology, not sure there...	24
1	A good decision, I doubt the Muslim Student Association or any religious group wants to run the risk of their group getting hijacked potentially.	24
1	*Paging Dr. Freud...Dr. Freud to /r/Christianity/...*	24
1	As i understand, the problem here is that these groups are restricting leadership roles in their groups based on religious affiliation. Your alternative would be for the groups to allow all people to run for these religious organizations' leadership positions, or go without school funding, correct?	24
1	A couple months ago I would have answered this.  But I no longer qualify...	24
1	At least from personal experience, i find that most non-denominational churches are like baptist. Usually conservative values, call themselves "bible believing" churches, have some hip dude as the worship leader, try to downplay "doctrine" and "theology" and just believe in the word.	24
1	I don't think it's a simple as a "nasty ultimatum."  My partner is telling me he's reaching his limit, that he's in too much pain to continue.  It wouldn't be very loving of me to just dismiss that, and I have my own doubts about my beliefs at this point.  It's not as simple as He wants sex, I don't; it's really not only about sex, it's about the pain of not being able to fully love each other after sharing so much.	24
1	You don't have to elect them, you just have to let them run. My university went through this same song and dance with its Christian groups, and a few of them were stubborn enough to cease being university-affiliated. All the other religious groups, however, including the Muslim groups, are in full compliance and I don't think any of them has been "hijacked" or whatever the fear is.	24
1	No, I'm for eliminating ASB funding for groups which discriminate.	24
1	Hear his reasons out. [There are entire books on this. I recommend this.](http://smile.amazon.com/God-Gay-Christian-Biblical-Relationships/dp/1601425163/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431223778&amp;sr=8-1).   I share your struggle, being a homosexual christian myself. I know at the least I would commit myself to wait for marriage. I would also love my partner to to be Christian as well.  I'll pray for you brother. I can't offer much other than the book I read [among many others].	24
1	Thank you.  I should have made it clearer in my post, but my partner wants us to get married before we make our relationship sexual.  I'm just not sure that God would approve of either, though my heart wants them.	24
1	I completely respect your celibacy.  Same sex intercourse cannot be reconciled with the Bible as it seems you know that to be true.  No amount of twisting of scripture can get around that.  As such what is most important, honouring God or compromising what you know to be right to please a person.     I want to encourage you to remain pure and not compromise your faith.    When an ultimatum like this is given in a relationship it is best to not continue on.   You are in my prayers brother.	24
1	I have never not seen this as a gif. Interesting.	24
1	This actually happened on my campus only it was a Student Republican group who rigged the election of the Marxist Student Association and spent the entire budget on ice cream effectively making the group defunct.	24
1	I'm always tempted to say so, but that's not a judgement I should make.  If only because people are always levelling it at *me* so I know what it feels like.	24
1	Does each Native American tribe have it's own belief system, or is there a common theology among most of the Native American tribes?  Can you point me to some web sites that might be able to teach me more about Native American religious beliefs?	24
1	If one wanted to be biblical about it, then Saturday would be that day, as Saturday is the sabbath.	24
1	Good point.  God judges.  We just nod our head politely and say "that's nice."^1       ^1 Any fan of Mrs. Brown's Boys will find this particularly funny.	24
1	People shouldn't judge you for they way you are honouring God with rest on Sunday, nor should you judge others for how they treat the Sabbath.  [Colossians 2:16]	24
1	Don't debate her, that will not accomplish anything positive.  If she wants to honour God that way, then that is a good thing.  It would probably harm her conscience if she didn't.  Conversely she should not judge others who do not see it her way.	24
1	Don't waver in your commitment to celibacy. The Almighty will help you see it through. The guy should leave and do his own thing. Don't be dragged into any of it. This man can't ever, nor any man, give you what only the Almighty can give you.   Good luck. Take care.	24
1	It doesn't seem like God is seeing me through. I just feel more and more alone.  My family wants nothing to do with me, my coreligionists are just suspicious of me, and now the one person I could always count on is about to slip away.  How am I supposed to go on like this?  The platitudes and scripture quotes aren't telling me that.	24
1	The best kind of not qualifying really :)	24
1	Please. That would be wonderful.  We would loose our cheap Easter candy, though... \#notsureifworth	24

1	A Freudian slip is when you say one thing but mean your mother!	24
1	Why are you in a relationship with a person if you intended to stay celibate? What was the end game here? It seems to me that much of your turmoil and his is the result of being in a situation of constant temptation.	24

1	Come on dude, Jesus left everyone hanging for three days.	24
1	Jesus didn't change anything, but the idea behind the meme is that people today have changed what Jesus said to make him a more likable fellow. I'm guessing that his words about hating your mother and father, for instance, would be ones that people have changed a bit to better suit them.	24
1	If Hilter came back with his ideals he would set the world right  ................  ....................  .........................  ^back ^into ^world ^war ^with ^millions ^more ^dying	24
1	I wish this aspect of change would be examined more. To me it looks like THE impetus for basically every theologically liberal denomination of Christianity. If an issue was figured out authoritatively 1500 years ago it is still figured out today for the same reasons. If there was an ecumenical council today it too would be authoritative 10,000 years from now and the faith would remain unchanged. Some changes people talk about, I think worse thoughts than I want to type out on reddit.	24
1	I live in Texas, and there is a thriving Christian community throughout the state. I personally attend a Baptist church, but the Catholic church is very strong here as well.  I am curious about your experience in Minnesota. Do you find that life is difficult for a Christian there? I only ask because you mention "wondering if life is easier for Christians" elsewhere. I would say, unequivocally, that life isn't difficult--at least as a product of their faith--for Christians anywhere in the States. We aren't  persecuted here. We may be mocked, but mockery doesn't equate to persecution.	24
1	This is one of the stupider ones I've seen.	24
1	...more like 2 millenia...	24
1	You act as if things exist outside of their historical context. As if ecumenical councils are not influenced by outside forces. As if, even, ecumenical councils speak for the entirety of Christendom.	24

1	The Mosaic law is not and never has been applicable to gentiles. 99% of Christians are gentiles.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Jerusalem	24
1	Sure. But I'm not Jewish. Becoming Jewish is explicitly not part of becoming Christian. The Jewish law, even if in effect, does not affect me since I am not Jewish.	24
1	When we are speaking of the earliest creeds and councils, doesn't this make God into a deceiver?  I mean, for 1900 years we've been saying that the Lord Jesus Christ will come again. If you are a Christian, do you really believe it's plausible that God let every Father, every saint, every denomination languish in error, and has just recently sent the full preterists to fulfill John 16:13 and sort us out?	24

1	My opinion on this is if it was a simple error then okay, nothing worth seeing here, but if it's more than a mistake than its really suspicious what the government is pulling here.	24
1	And they will likely grow to resent that stance, and in turn resent the beliefs behind it. It's happened to many many people I know. Nobody enjoys being forced into something. You can raise your kids how you want but I want to warn you 90% of the time this will lead to resentment and bitterness.	24
1	I cannot speak for the Adventist Church but as far as the church in general, its job is to teach the Gospel to all nations. NOT try to squeeze current events into symbolic book written about events in 70AD.	24

1	How do you determine "theologically sound" reasoning?  Whose theology?  The ecumenical councils have their own theologies which--I hate to say it--are influenced by their own cultural milieus.  The line between societal influence and theology is not nearly so bright as you seem to be imagining it to be.	24
1	You honestly didn't post much, it just seems to be "I'm 13 and I like church."  I understand you're young and trying to find your own identity but don't look to the internet for validation on who you are or what you want to be. It can often hurt you more than help you.	24
1	I mean, I feel like we'd probably just kill him. I don't think there's a statute of limitations on being Hitler.	24
1	Its not really fair to discount someone's thoughts like that and say you dont really think theyve made the decisions they have because you think something different.	24
1	Are you saying that football is not a sacrament?	24
1	The state wants to preserve institutions of cultural identity. This is usually true.	24
1	I really dislike this attitude that because you can't imagine making the journey from atheist to theist, then his journey must be illegitimate. That it's impossible for an atheist to ever leave atheism or change their mind, unless of course they were just fake atheists the whole way.  We're all convinced that the way we've chosen is the correct one, but that doesn't mean everyone with a different experience is lying.	24
1	Attended it on my motorcycle, which of course attracted a small crowd of children whose parents were expecting me to put on some kind of bike-starting show for them.

1	You sound like a Calvinist accusing atheists of never being a TrueChristian in the first place	24
1	Exactly. Now if only the right wing politicians would systematically give all their money to the poor and help the sick. Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me. For some reason that now means to keep all the giant mansions and million dollar paychecks and give a few bucks to a charity on occasion because it's easier to follow.	24
1	If the world hates you, be sure they're hating you for the right reasons. There's always the possibility that you might be doing something wrong.	24
1	Saint Monica, exemplary mother of the great Augustine, you perseveringly pursued your wayward son not with wild threats but with prayerful cries to heaven. Intercede for all mothers in our day so that they may learn to draw their children to God.

1	&gt; In the middle ages, ethics was barely a field,  If you mean as separate from Theology and other Philosophy, sure, that was Kant's idea.  But as in examination of the morality of acts, there were a lot of people doing that.  A large portion of the Summa is just "Is X a sin?", "Is it grave matter?" etc.	24

1	&gt; Scientism.

The problem is that these ideas are fundamentally untestable either positively or negatively, and thus are outside of what science considers as science. This does reflect rather poorly on taking those ideas seriously, though. Saying I have an invisible dragon that cannot be detected with any test known does *not* make it a scientific idea.	24
1	&gt; They could be wrong, but treat them like people, not like obstinante, oppositional objects to be dismissed  The same could be same of those who adhere to traditional viewpoints around here. You see variations of the "It's 2015, come on, get with the times" argument advanced by many Christians, which seems to be liberal corollary to the above argument.	24
1	What?? Our of all the things we talk about in this sub this is the most harmless by far. It is a simple fact that a lot of people in Texas want to go to church and watch the Cowboys.	24
1	It was good. The baby whose family always sits in front of me thinks I'm awesome now and spends half of Mass smiling at me.	24
1	Actually, scientism means "the belief in the universal applicability of the scientific method and approach, and the view that empirical science constitutes the most authoritative worldview or most valuable part of human learning to the exclusion of other viewpoints."  Thus Quantum Mechanics is still science, because it is founded on empirical evidence.  Misapplication of Quantum Mechanics is not, because there is no evidence to back them up.	24
1	Yes, but not as described by the OP. The OP is simply doing "anything that doesn't confirm my entirely baseless notions must be scientism". That has nothing to do with either science or scientism, and everything to do with it being easy to blame others for the lack of acceptance of a view, but very hard to make a decent and compelling argument for the views they are trying to push. Therefore: conspiracy by the "so-called mainstream science".	24
1	I'm in the same boat. It's hard, but I'm trying to look to other strong women in my life now. Its not blood relations that make someone a mother.	24
1	Jesus would definitely get downvoted in this sub.	24
1	Well, you dont have to take the bible (particularly genesis) as literal, scientific truth. In fact, most Christians dont.	24
1	Live sports wait for no man	24
1	I'm dumb. I don't get it. Especially when it's not in the possessive case.	24
1	Good! We decided to have the May Crowning today, which was pleasant, and we gave flowers out to all of the mothers (including Our Lady!).	24
1	First of all, leave any assumptions you may have about the Bible having to be taken literally, not be looked at critically, etc. if you're a Christian at the door.   http://biologos.org/  This website might help you understanding Genesis without renouncing science.  If it helps you in any way, the overwhelming majority of Christian denominations (including the Catholic and Orthodox churches) accept evolution as being a valid theory. A Catholic priest invented the Big Bang theory.	24
1	And you act as if the Holy Spirit didn't guide those Ecumenical Councils. It doesn't matter if people tried to force them one way or the other- they're guaranteed by the Holy Spirit. It's like humans in the Church- we can sin and do awful things and try to move the Church in one way or the other, but the Holy Spirit still guarantees the doctrine and dogma according to Matthew 16.	24
1	Huh?   Papal infallibility.	24
1	Oh, Paypal infallibility. Got it. Like I said, I'm dumb.  And I was referring to your its vs it's mistake because I'm pedantic.	24
1	Hey, leave Jimmy Carter out of this.	24
1	&gt; I bought a King James edition bible to try and read, but I haven't gotten past Genesis. It conflicts with too much of my personal belief in in evolution, geology, etc.  Don't start with Genesis, or any of the OT. Start with the Gospels, probably Mark, the shortest and starkest.	24
1	That's a highly logical argument. You're a *homophobe*, therefore anything you say is wrong!  Good job, mate.	24
1	Perhaps it wasn't such a bad idea that large parts of the bible are in Hebrew and Aramaic: no punctuation. Otherwise we'd be hearing about Jesus and the twelve apostrophes. And was Lazarus actually dead? Or was he just unconscious, nearly in a comma?	24
1	Thank the Good Lord for the [Bible alone(with regards to authority)](http://i.imgur.com/rPZ61qU.gif)!	24
1	Many Christians (Both contemperary and ancient) believe that certain parts of the Bible, like Genesis are allegorical. For example, Genesis represents the rise and fall of man.	24
1	Amazing, if Cuba is Socialist *and* Catholic then I think I may have to move.	24
1	Wrong, some things will affect you no matter what you choose. But you can choose to minimize it or not let it stop you in *some* things.	24
1	&gt;Every word of scripture is literal and inerrant.  The bible says that the earth was made in 7 days, and that plants existed before the sun. How is that literal?	24
1	God let me know he is real for a fact!  And Jesus died for my sins so I get to go to Heaven.   Every moment of Heaven will be better than our best moment down here on Earth.     Colossians 3:1 You have been raised to life with Christ, so set your hearts on the things that are in heaven, where Christ sits on his throne at the right side of God.  Servitude and just neutral time passing is positive gain because I get closer to Heaven.   I want to serve the best I can because Jesus died for me and I want to live for him.	24
1	&gt;The thing is, the people who think that culture and geographical location have a lot to do with religious belief don't deny this and it does nothing to alleviate the criticism. Overwhelmingly, people stay within their culture's dominant religion.  ... said the atheist from the secular West.	24
1	Thank you. Reading this helps but how do I lean on Christ? I've been trying hard to be strong, patient, and praying every night. I still feel shameful, regret, and lost.	24
1	How is it a violation of the Second Commandment again?	24
1	It is? So, Orthodox, Catholics, Anglicans and goodness knows what other denominations are anti Christian?	24
1	Praying that the Supreme Court rules on the side of the law and justice and for same-sex marriage.	24
1	It doesn't give me much hope in the standard of the survey.	24
1	That chart tells me that &gt;= 78% pray. I'm also wondering what happened to the last 1%. Whatever.	24
1	The second commandment refers to idolatry. Simply making a piece of artwork of Jesus is not idolatry. Worshipping said artwork, or really any inanimate object, is idolatry and is a violation of the second commandment.	24
1	PEW are *generally* pretty good at what they do. I'm happy to accept that any organisation can err, but...	24
1	But it is not Christ. It is simply an image. Does our faith lay with images of Christ?	24
1	Freedom of expression protects from government censorship; it doesn't protect you from the social repercussions of what you say.	24
1	His thoughts on the symbol of the crucifixion just seems to be an asspull to justify his "art". Who says that the meaning of the crucifixion has changed? He himself?  It was anti-Christian when he thought it up, regardless of his personal interpretations.	24
1	Yeah exactly, its a beautiful picture and how he got the color just further illustrates that in a genius way. Its entire message is something beautiful coming from something disgusting through Christ.  An image of a tortured, executed corpse hung for display and submerged in filth becomes beautiful because its subject is Jesus. Its hard to communicate a message more powerful than that.	24
1	I don't care about the artist's intentions, the result is disgusting and HIGHLY offensive (to me anyway).	24
1	What do you mean 'know'? Are you talking about scripture or inherent knowledge?	24
1	Homosexuality is not a sin. It's no more a sin than hetrosexuality.	24
1	One day, Satan decides to turn hell into a luxury resort in order to attract more customers. God, visibly upset, tells Satan:  "That's not what hell is for! You're breaking the rules! You can't do that!"  To which Satan replies:  "Oh yeah? Says you and what lawyers?"	24
1	Do you have evidence for this? In certain societies homosexuality was celebrated, and I didn't know that homosexuality was a bad thing growing up. In fact, I had gay relatives who I thought were completely fine and normal people. I think you are referring to hate mongering indoctrination.	24
1	&gt; Muslims have a reputation regarding images.  How can you say this when you are literally responnding to a Muslim saying,  &gt;the result is disgusting and HIGHLY offensive (to me anyway).	24
1	That doesn't mean it's right.	24
1	Except they are physically unable to not be homosexual. They cant "try" to not be, it is as inherant in them as herterosexuality.	24
1	I'm not really sure how submerging a representation of our Lord into human urine has anything to do with restoring a sense of disgust with execution on the cross. It seems that a depiction of the brutality of crucifixion would do a better job of that.	24
1	You can't really equate a person' struggle against lying with a different person's struggle against their homosexual identity.   That's like comparing a rubber duck to a battleship.	24
1	A very great many of us don't believe that homosexuality is a sin.	24
1	According to Jesus, it actually is about desires, not just acts: He was quite concerned about what goes on in peoples' hearts...	24
1	A great many of Christians don't believe that homosexuality is a sin.	24
1	Regardless of what the artist says, it's a poor piece of work which was done in poor taste.  Who is he to declare what the symbol of the cross ought to mean to the worlds Christians?  If scripture tells us to focus on the good, the beautiful and the lovely, how does this fit into that?	24
1	You may think they are in error, but they are still Christians. That is, a great many of Christians don't believe that homosexuality is a sin, so your response to /u/dolphins3 doesn't really make sense.	24
1	No.  You shouldn't be comfortable with Piss Christ.  You shouldn't be comfortable with the Cross.  We did far worse to Christ on the cross than urinate on Him.  The piece should give us pause and perspective.  It's a work I'll actually defend, in large part *because* it's so offensive.	24
1	"We would not indeed obscure the difference which divides us from Rome. The gulf is indeed profound. But profound as it is, it seems almost trifling compared to the abyss which stands between us and many ministers of our own Church."  -Gresham Machen	24
1	Your post says husband and wife compliment each other. That is not explaining how homosexuality is harmful. Your post says man and woman have different jobs in parenting. Since many forms of parents and parenting exist, that is probably false.	24
1	At the very least, /u/privatly is pointing out the error in calling *homosexuality* rather than *homosexual acts* a sin.  If homosexuality were a sin itself, that would be tantamount to *temptation* calling itself sin, which is contradicted consistently in the Bible--rather, giving in to temptation is the sin.  Heterosexuals can sin by improperly acquiescing to their sexuality, and (according to traditional interpretations) bi- and homosexuals do so by giving in at all.  Perhaps, though, privatly was saying that homosexual acts are not sin, which is an opinion held by many modern Christians, myself included.  I don't have the energy to engage in *that* conversation again though.	24
1	You think we don't believe that because we simply haven't read our Bibles?  That strikes me as rather patronizing.	24
1	Best of luck! I do hope you find what youre looking for.	24
1	I'd like everyone to notice that, for once, I didn't make this gay thread. :)	24

1	Americans.  &gt;For many Americans, every day is a day of prayer. More than half (55%) of Americans said they pray every day, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center survey, while 23% said they pray weekly or monthly and 21% said they seldom or never pray. Even among those who are religiously unaffiliated, 21% said they pray daily. Women (65%) are more likely than men (46%) to pray every day. Older people (60%) are more likely than younger adults (45%) to say they pray daily.  -- http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/06/5-facts-about-prayer/	24

1	Or something like that. There *are* a number of people here who consider my very existence an abomination soooo.... [shrug]	24
1	I guess it has to do with the fact that the majority of LGBT Christians do not want to live lives of celibacy	24
1	- [Deuteronomy 21:10-14] - captured women forced to marry the people who killed their families. - [Leviticus 25:44-46] - don't have israelite slaves, but foreigner slaves are a-ok.  I know that there are ways to interpret these generously, redemptive trajectories and such. But you can't deny they're there. Just as I am not denying there are passages in scripture about homosexuality. I just think they can also do with careful, generous interpretation, passed through our conscience.	24
1	&gt;However, this movement will never, ever succeed, for as even they acknowledge, both the New Testament and the Church Fathers are clear on the sinful nature of homosexual acts.  I think the various Christian sects that include legitimate homosexual marriages might disagree with you.	24
1	I am not conflicted, but I know I'm the target of the op.	24
1	&gt;As most of you know, there is a large political movement by some homosexuals and their supporters to attempt to legitimize homosexuality within Christianity.  and all research shows we are succeeding, thank God!	24
1	Have you ever paused in your anger to ask, "where do they come from?"	24
1	So very similar to the same things said about women's rights, interracial marriage, and abolition. Those issues, like this one, has Christians on both sides. And all of those are accepted today. Most people could care less how churches or religions define marriages internally, outside of informed consent. What they do care about is when those definitions are moved to the civil law.	24
1	While I can't see the future, I do hope you're wrong about the path Christianity is taking. Nothing would make me happier than if LGBT people no longer committed suicide because of the words of people who hold your views.	24
1	That is...wow. Thats horrible.	24
1	Like he cares what heretics do. His church is Number 1 and 100% correct 100% of the time	24
1	Seriously, man, I just don't know what to say to him.	24
1	I'm so sorry, that's pretty awful. :(	24
1	I will defend the offensive because we *need* to be reminded of the shocking.  We need to confront the world as it is, not as we want it to be.  We need to remember that the world as we know it is fallen and that we *should* be fundamentally offended by that fact.  There is a large current in American Christianity in particular that wants to run from difficulty, from horror, from things that upset us.  We need to confront those things instead of hiding them and hiding from them.  We need to avoid living in a bubble of self-deluded comfort.	24
1	&gt;faith in America is dropping exponentially. This gives me hope.  Just wondering, why does it give you hope?	24
1	&gt; We did far worse to Christ on the cross than urinate on Him.  &gt; The piece should give us pause and perspective.  I like your take on this.	24
1	The same reason it gives OP hope. Each of us think our worldview is correct, so we want more people to believe it.	24
1	Don't be sorry for me. Be sorry for what is obviously a very troubled community.	24
1	It doesn't make any logical sense either. As you said, what did the child do to deserve this? I'd be more concerned if he said they were planning on telling the child his parents were demonic or something during class, but this? How is it effective?	24
1	Exodus 21 provides a slavery instruction manual.	24
1	&gt;I’m cool with those programs until the minute their sacraments become sacred.   Read: I'm cool with sacraments unless you think they're actually sacramental.  Personally, I don't want the sacraments because they're aesthetically better or more authentic (though they are). I want them because they're Means of Grace, instruments God uses to forgive my sins.  Duh doi.	24
1	Why do we keep approaching this situation as though Christ is somehow contaminated by the urine? That's what happened with the leper, right? Christ touched the leper and became unclean and died of skin disease?	24
1	Because we're made of meat.	24
1	And that's how God works. It's part of the beauty of the Incarnation: God is fine using plain and humble physical stuff to do spiritual heavy lifting.	24
1	I should have tagged this as support from the start, but I have now. Please don't go there, per rule 2.5. I don't want to deal with that kind of crap right now.	24
1	Er...Don't you think that's a bit of a tough thing for little children to listen to? I mean, from a scientific perspective, it's not that uncommon for kids to have same sex 'crushes', and this might make them feel guilty. Don't you think there is enough sexual guilt going on? Also, these kids have same sex *parents*, so we can't go around telling them that their parents are abominable sinners. I don't think I need to explain why that is a **bad** idea.	24
1	Personally, I don't see a reason to put a depiction of someone you love in urine for reasons that don't really hold up to examination. It's about love and respect for Christ.  I mean, if you found me making representations of my mother and dunking them in urine, you'd probably think I had some bad feelings toward her.	24
1	The manner in which the gospel is presented by those who profess it.	24
1	Whats even more scary is the fact that some people only do good in fear of an eternal punishment or a [divine reward](http://img.pandawhale.com/139394-true-detective-rust-cohle-quot-IelQ.jpeg).	24
1	I wonder if they would also turn away children of single parents, or children of parents who are a couple but never legally married. Or divorced parents who have remarried. If you're going to be self-righteous about defining marriage, you have to at least be consistent.	24
1	Do you really think it is a daycare's role to teach preschool children *anything* about sex?	24
1	Pride. Being a Christian means admitting you're a failure, that you can never live up to God's standards and must instead throw yourself at the feet of Christ and beg for mercy.  For a lot of people, that kind of submission is very hard.	24
1	Dang it Greg, you beat me to it.  I find it funny that no theist has said this yet. Though the top post saying "other religious upbringing" is probably the most correct answer in terms of population numbers.	24
1	I SAW THAT FLAIR CHANGE.	24
1	That was the most self centered article I have read in a long time.	24
1	That's kind of like saying - "Why don't more people accept Buddhism as the true faith?"   "Because their karmic samsaric cycles are damaged. Duh."	24
1	Not all religious people are Christian, not all spiritual people are religious, not all people that believe in a god are religious, yet they all can pray.	24
0	Then you have been vastly under-exposed to the people in the conservative faction of Christianity.  Your experience is severely out of balance with the actual distribution.	24
0	Gays can already get married just as much as anyone else can. The problem is when they want to pretend *a completely different relationship* is marriage. And to make it worse, that relationship (sodomy) is gravely sinful.  If gays asked for legal privileges *similar to those of marriage*, but without trying to taint the term "marriage", they'd get further. Even moreso if they advocated for those privileges equally for other non-sodomite relationships (eg, brother+sister, monks, nuns, non-sodomite same-sex flatmates, etc).	24
0	That a "ceremony" requires powers of mind, I grant; but relations are accidents of individuals, and real relations have a real essence based on objects in the world.  Complimentary sex organs, once used on each other, establish a relation that ends at death; the Bible calls it marriage.	24
0	I've always found the term "shoehorning" to be a bit strange. A shoehorn is a tool that is used to overcome resistance when trying to put something where it *does belong*.	24
0	They're arguing past each other.  The FRC claim is that male-male pedophiles are a subcategory of homosexuals. UC Davis disagrees, but seems to simply assert the point, before going on to "debunk" several sources, which were never intended to make the point they are refuting. The FRC listed a couple studies that they claimed indicate that male-male pedophiles tend to also be homosexual, which weren't mentioned at all in the UC Davis summary (that I could find.)  Regardless, UC Davis did a poor job here, since they ignored the actual point in contention and jumped ahead.	24
0	yep. Once their community found out what they were up to, they were boycotted by a large portion of the community and most if not all of the vender who used to refer customers to them.   i wonder why?	24
0	Highly doubtful, when He says we will be like the angels in Heaven, its basically saying we will be neither male nor female in body.	24

0	Satanists (lol) can't show that it violates a sincerely held religious belief. But Christians can show that changing marriage or committing abortion violates a sincerely held religious belief by turning to [Genesis 2:23–24] or [Matthew 5:21 ] of the ancient text.	24

0	It doesn't matter as there are all manner of variations - just go to any parallel web site and view 10 or so translations. The point is that professional translators read it exactly like I did. There are no mainstream academics (historical critical) that read it the way you did because it goes way beyond the information content found in the text and basically engages in imaginary mind reading of the deity figure depicted there.	24
0	Since God created logic, couldn't he destroy it and recreate it in a different way? Perhaps God can both be able to create a rock that is too heavy to lift and be able to lift it, and perhaps it is just something we are unable to understand. Thats the excuse Christians always gives me when it comes to things about God that cannot be explained	24
0	1. You shouldn't say anything negative about Islam. PERIOD!  2. You need to open your eyes past your privileges.   3. I don't expect a typical redditor to understand why what they say is racist and yes it is hard for us as people to admit when we're being racist.  4. You're offending an entire group of people.  5. You're speaking out against PoC's which is hate speech.	24

0	Atheists online who have rarely ever encountered or heard about religion are usually the more ambivalent ones. Those that have come from a religious upbringing or are surrounded by religion a lot and then turn atheist like to rage online and are more likely to talk about the damage religion does. I definitely seen people get lashed at and shamed for believing but usually for bringing up topics like creationism, antigay, antiabortion, antipot sentiments. A lot of the friction between atheists and Christians come from politics and the origin of the universe. The common sentiment is the more religious someone is the more batshit crazy they are.	24
0	He's basically saying that Genesis is contradicting logic/science and he wants an explanation.	24
0	That thing has fascinated me for so long!! With what God has created in just our three/four dimensions, and what little of it we have experienced or seen, I can't even fathom what is in the higher dimensions! We are perceiving only 3-4 dimensions out of the theorized 10-13 total dimensions.	24
0	I don't think it's that God *can't* do things, but that *if* God chose to do them, logic is itself void and therefore there is no point to even considering it as a logical possibility.	24

0	Your knowledge of facts is impressive. Your ability to sort, categorize, and draw conclusions from them needs a significant amount of work. Most people tend to have either a better memory or a better analytical mind. I think you might have been gifted with the former.  Anyone who walks away from a serious study of Church history with "I really respect some Protestant positions for their consistency with the early Church" has utterly failed in either the depth or breadth of their study.	24
0	Yes, "for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God" but "while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."  The real question that I'm sure you're asking is whether LGBT activities are sinful - the Bible says they are, but I don't believe that they are any more sinful than any other sin.	24
0	Because you are. Some people don't like lying by the fire or reading. They don't miss it.   Sex is on a whole other level of distraction. There are chapters and chapters about in the bible and countless paintings, poems, and movies about it.	24
0	And had the best answer so far.	24
0	Sex isn't important.	24
0	I can read it, but it doesn't actually show up which is a little annoying.	24

0	Well, good on you for being consistent afterall.  Unfortunately most Christians clearly don't concern themselves much with adultery, or at least don't want it enforced, but are concerned rather with the sins of others (which living as a homosexual should not be a sin anyway).	24
0	Do I believe it? No.   Why? Have you read the Bible?	24
0	So your argument is that god is an asshole, deal with it?	24
0	The world God created and the people he created in his image suck?  So either God sucks or he is an asshole?	24
0	And God allowed it.	24
0	The possibility is too small to be considered. The point I was making is that there are probably many 9 and 10 homosexuals. Why should they remain chaste?	24
0	You misunderstand. I'm not saying the prophets are correct in everything they did, and the Bible records many times the prophets made mistakes and corrected by God. They are always correct when they are preaching the word of God.   [2 Peter 1:21 KJV]	24
0	This guy brings gems of truth from the bottom of the rabbit hole, sadly i don't think this sub will catch any of it.	24
0	Yes, because it is the Word of GOD.   "Whoever trusts in his own mind is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom will be delivered."	24
0	I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too self-aware. Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself - we are creatures that should not exist by natural law... We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, that accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everbody's nobody... I think the honorable thing for our species to do is to deny our programming. Stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction - one last midnight, brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.	24
0	The church's authority to *grow* - as in change nature from its founding - is No Where Found. The church is what it was in the first century; or IT is a fiction.	24

0	Turning left and turning right is, like a spelling mistake, an irrelevant event that has no bearing on truth of the words. If the Bible made a factual error, it would have enormous implications as to the greater truth of the book.  As I said, you can't equate a book and a human, that's just foolish. Even the idea of something being more or less infallible than something else is absurd. Something is infallible or it isn't.	24

0	Its strange, back in the 60's there was medical evidence that smoking was bad for you, yet it took nearly 30 years to convince society of the medical facts. Today there is medical evidence that cannabis is bad for you, and again people are ignoring the warnings from the medical profession. Before any one jumps down my throat, yes cannabis has properties that can help some medical conditions.	24
0	There are 2 questions:  whether bio-comp does count, and whether it should count.  I think bio-comp should count and retain its own name,  which is marriage.	24

0	What is this even about? Doesn't make any sense to me. What are these rituals that Catholics insist on arguing about? Get back to gospel.	24
0	Why do you have a cross next to your name then?	24
0	"Inspired" was the wrong word. Jesus is God, so he naturally has no need for inspiration. What I should have said was that every aspect of Jesus's life is not important for teaching doctrine. I mistakenly applied terminology for words to a person, as you've been doing.	24
0	Gaudi?...*Gaudy*?	24
0	...because you think that, to be pro-women, we have to artificially put them in positions of power? Women can't be equal unless they're ruling?	24
0	To be forgiven of sin, we must make a firm resolve never to sin again. We will probably screw up anyway, but we must still make the resolve every time. If we don't even try, at some point God will cut us off from the graces we need to repent. As long as you can still repent, you can be forgiven - but you *can't* do that without God's help.	24
0	If you believe the bible then it is understandable. It does say that unbelievers are immoral. It doesn't get much traction here, but in person I've  met few Christians who would trust an unbeliever. It's very common because that's what scripture says. It was hammered into me in church for years.	24

0	Someone else actually already convinced me that there are major problems with the California bill as proposed (although not the ones I expected), but that doesn't change the fact that it is a legitimate political opinion, and the principle of which God Himself explicitly endorsed.  And even prior to changing my mind on this, I informed you I was willing to follow any rules you set down (including not advocating such politics). Thereafter you banned me from ##Christian, so I concluded your rationale was merely holding such an opinion, *not* advocating it as you seem to be implying - if I am wrong on that, please explain why I was/remain banned.	24
0	No need to perceive attacks where there aren't any, sorry if it came off that way. The fact is, scripture does say it and many people believe it. Perhaps the law being written on men's hearts and then them being unbelievers is the source of the frequent claim that there are not any actual atheists, that they are just in rebellion.	24
0	are you saying that jesus is 1/2 god and 1/2 man?!  white cant be black, black cant be white. if an object is both black and white, that object cant be 100% white nor 100% black, it may be 50% or 40% black etc etc. but not 100% black  a true god must be 100% god.	24

It is unclear anyone could pass that test to maintain any of their rights.  What is interesting about the recent, similar case with the printer who won largely on free speech grounds, it may be on those grounds that the baker wins as well. It is well established that what we do and produce is covered by our free speech rights.	24

0	First lets clarify a key point. That is that attraction is NOT action. ALL sexual relations involving humans involves a choice by at least 1. We as a society has to decide whether or not we want to sanction this behavior. Gay Marriage at it's core involves behavior and a choice no matter how the gay community wants to spin the issue.   We are not talking about the same rights as African Americans or any other group. We are talking about sanctioning and calling "normal" a particular pattern of behavior.	24

0	That sums up centuries of religious debate and [roughly 41,000 denominations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations) who all think the other guys have it wrong. No one is going to reach a consensus on the correct way to read it any time soon.	24

0	&gt;11 A woman[a] should learn in quietness and full submission. 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man;[b] she must be quiet. 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 14 And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. 15 But women[c] will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. (1 Timothy 2)  I think it's pretty clear who's doing the submitting.	24
0	I think perhaps that verses taken out of context do not convey the intended meaning. **John 14:28 - "If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I."**  Well by your same interpretation I **must** love Jesus, because I celebrate his ascension?	24
0	I don't see how any of that contradicts what I said but ok.	24
0	Sacrificing yourself for someone =/= submission to that person. Women are needed to produce children so it makes sense to protect them as you would your cattle.	24
0	Praying brings me comfort and helps me express my appreciation. It's not like praying is some magical spell that you say and things happen.  It is therapeutic for me.	24
0	ok, well you said John 14:28 shows that we cannot love Jesus because we cannot follow he teachings perfectly (implying that humans are fallible) I don't disagree, in part. I don't follow his words exactly, this is part of the reason that in church we confess our failings and ask for forgiveness, and work at doing better. God knows that we are not perfect, hence part of the reason Jesus came.   I said, (in the same manner as you) that John 14:28 shows that by taking rejoice, and celebrating ascension that I must love Jesus.	24

0	&gt;Sacrifice: give up (something important or valued) for the sake of other considerations.  &gt;Submission: the action or fact of accepting or yielding to a **superior force** or to the will or authority of another person.  Those definitions are night and day. When you surrender to the enemy in war, you submit to foreign rule but you don't sacrifice for them. When a parent dies for his children he sacrifices for them; he doesn't submit to them.  Those words aren't even remotely similar.	24
0	Did you know you were gay before you went?  I can understand someone in the closet going to a fundamentalist school, but not if they were openly gay.  Not dismissing your choice and reasons.

0	It doesn't grind my gears but it makes me cringe because they're not being logical about their atheism.  If you truly believe that there is no god and that the universe is a product of chance then there is no meaning in life and no ultimate source of right and wrong and everything is subjective.  What you end up with is, as Richard Dawkins says, "everyone dancing to their DNA."  Morality is a non-factor in true atheism and very few people travel down that road because deep down their consciences attest to them that there is an over-arching moral law to the universe, just as Romans 1 states.	24
0	Should they not? Christians believe it impossible to not sin.	24
0	Where on the page does it say "We do not teach evolution to our students"?  I'm curious about what motivates these obviously false strawmen attacks. It's obviously not Liberty itself (as your post shows).  Is this some sort of ideological beef?	24

0	&gt;OT God is much more warlike, judgemental, and jealous than the "God is Love" of the NT.  I think that there's a lot of picking and choosing that goes into that characterization. It's possible to choose verses in such a way that gives the opposite impression. For example, using Psalms, Isaiah and Jeremiah to demonstrate that God is loving, then talk about Jesus cleansing the Temple (John), God avenging His people (Hebrews) and Jesus returning to slaughter His enemies (Revelation).	24
0	I remember reading that paragraph like three times, scratching my head and thinking "lol, whut?" I already had some doubts, but it was pretty much right then I decided not to pursue secular psychology.

Many employers just want a degree, so it's not like having it doesn't give me other options as well.	24

0	1. How is it done then? People need to get the message that certain things are wrong. People who do something wrong go to jail and perhaps get it and do it again. Once a person decides to murder, he in my opinion is always will be a threat since he had that thought unless he becomes a Christian.   3. They didn't kill them. Perhaps the girls would've loved to be with the Jews since they didn't prostitute, rape, or sacrifice them.	24

0	Easily. Hitler was an Atheist. Or what about [Legaue of Militant Atheists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Militant_Atheists). There has been atheists killing in the name of atheism as well. Here [a good article about a man killing in the name of atheism](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/02/12/1363967/-About-That-Atheist-Man-Who-Killed-3-Young-Muslims-In-NC-Don-t-Forget-The-Atheist-Part).  Atheists just have power since a few years. And only in the rich world. Therfor it isn't as bad as it could have been. Just look at Christianity: now it is peacefull. But extreme situations form extremists.  Religion is not bad: some humans are.	24
0	Actually I hate on **some** atheists, since I came online. There is a lot of hatred. So I think the hatred is both ways. I am able to hate on some people -  not able to hate an entire belief. I don't get it, how you can hate all for the cause of few.	24
0	Umm...I live in the U.S. but I've always held the extreme hate for the justice system in today's world because I think it is completely wacko. I mean, nothing is really done to stop these things from happening...people blame God that He doesn't do anything to intervene but He perfectly set it up in His laws of how to control things. Personally, I find God to be a very just God and loving as well. Seems too merciful to me in many ways...there I go being like Jonah as well. The only difference is that Nineveh changed their ways and humbled themselves while the people today don't.	24
0	Jesus was talking about civil disputes right here not self-protection...if someone kills me for my faith, okay. However, if someone just attacks me or my wife, I see nothing against protecting myself and my wife. I'm not going to probably kill them but just be able to stop them - especially if that person is more of less after my wife.	24
0	So you tell me, that you are treated like homosexuals in Russia or Africa? Sorry to tell you, but where I am from (Germany/Scandinavia) you can belief in whatever you want - and no one cares. In Russia you are killed for your sexuality. I agree with you, that some humans are bad - and some are Christians. But there are also some [atheists killing in the name of atheism](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/02/12/1363967/-About-That-Atheist-Man-Who-Killed-3-Young-Muslims-In-NC-Don-t-Forget-The-Atheist-Part).	24

0	&gt; Hitler was not an atheist.  Well, that is a [huge discussion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Adolf_Hitler).   &gt;  Atheism is not a religion.  Well, some say it is - and some say it isn't. The word atheism comes from 'a' (not) theism (religious). Or something like that. But it is still a belief or lack of belief (there is no God or belief in something else) or lack of belief (I don't want to belief there is or isn't a God).	24
0	Maybe because he wasn't sure he was God. If He creates him and he doesn't rebel then He doesn't need to pay heed to His absolute know, if He does and he does, then the know is true and absolute.	24

0	But hasn't that person already chosen their destiny of choosing to live by violence, though? People who have chosen to live in peace are fine. People who have chosen violence and evil is incredibly wrong. I mean, most likely if they've chosen that path then they are going to end up in Hell no matter what...unless they repent and you don't see a lot of murderers and rapists asking Jesus into their heart these days.	24

0	That was maybe to the extreme with the Bears but it was God's prophet and God's name through the prophets is holy.   The firstborns...so I would've died as well. These people weren't Jews but they were incredibly stubborn and beat the Jews and paid them as slaves. They themselves killed the Jewish male babies as well. Have you ever thought of that? Killing every Jewish baby not just the firstborn.   I'm sure if you make it to Heaven, you'll point out everything God did wrong, evil, or petty and He'll show you why He did those things if you have yet to learn now.	24
0	Added some verses. I get it - my views are quite different than people but to me it is no different than real justice. What's real justice - not people's but God's justice. I'm sure God had a good reason for doing all of those things (my points) if He doesn't, then He is a liar for He says He is perfectly just, slow to anger, and forgiving. I saw that when I read the OT constantly.	24
0	By that criteria you should stop saying there are 1.2 billion Catholics due to the extraordinary number of people around the world who dissent (often substantially) from Catholic teaching on particular issues. The in vs. out group in your rigidly dichotomous worldview would be small indeed.	24
0	I am against the death penalty when we don't know all of the facts but I am an advocate for it I guess when there are enough of them to suggest that person did some horrible crime. It's the death penalty for a reason because you yourself committed a crime such as that. People say that it is inhumane to put someone to death in yet it is also incredibly inhumane to rape someone -in a self, I find rape, which often leads to death such as gang rape as the same but more despicable crime than just shooting someone, which literally has no pain.	24
0	Isn't that NT? Plus Jesus said that and who are you to question Him? Hmm? Although, I think He was just simply making a point to the extreme.	24
0	&lt;/thread&gt;	24
0	Oh, of course... :P   Even more so if you're an atheist...there's going to be no real justice toward them and since there is no afterlife in your opinion, might as well have them die for they have no worth at all except for taxes for citizens and more work for the security. There's no meaning to their life anymore except for being in a jail.	24
0	If they didn't worship the one true God then in God's opinion, they are sons of the devil, which is evil. They worshiped gods such as baal who are demons. Anything in this world that is not from God but of the devil can be used against us and lead us into more sin and harm and God doesn't want that since He wants us to be with Him.	24
0	I don't see how that version is very different. It's still saying the same thing with different phrasing. The basic message is that unbelievers are corrupt and do evil things.   Regardless of translation. I'm just curious why verses like that are so heavily detested in this sub.	24
0	Oh, these were the same people who murdered all of the Jewish babies as well. Plus, it was Pharaoh's heart and his rulers that were stubborn. They could've easily said that when the first plague happened or even before, he could've let them go.  Are if you a Christian and if you think God is evil, then don't worship Him or be a Christian. Simple as that!	24
0	Why do we desire to do evil on Earth?	24
0	Good day to you as well!	24
0	Will we be able to commit sins?	24
0	The first duty of the government is "to bear the sword".  Today, we use guns and handcuffs, but the effect is the same.  Consider, if you do not pay your taxes, at some point men with guns will come and lock you up.  So, then - using tax money to "help the poor" is really holding a gun to someone's head and forcing them to give their money to someone else.  I don't think that is what Christianity is about...	24
0	"But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also." Matthew 5:39  Slaps cheek or something like that is kind of low on violence to me. Jesus never said to start violence or continue with it and get aggressive but to be kind and if they continue to be that way and you don't, they will be put to shame by you or God in the future and you will receive a reward.	24
0	Why weren't we created with this sinless nature?	24
0	What about the same kind of temptation that made Satan rebel against God? When he rebelled, there was no world, there was no flesh and there was no devil. And still he rebelled. So There must be another source of temptation.	24
0	Justice is a "just fair or treatment." So murdering someone...well, killing not murdering them is justice and mercy to everyone else in my opinion. That's being fair with the victim's family. Put yourself in the same situation and perhaps now you can't think of it really but if it does happen, you will want that kind of justice to be done. Being locked up and given food, shelter, clothing, among perhaps other things is not that bad.	24
0	But why did God decide to condemn people to suffering if he could have created beings of sinless nature instead?	24
0	Definitely.  But I don't think one can argue it is the Christian thing to do.  The government has the power to do as they please, because of the sword.	24
0	&gt; Do you think we'll be able to make the same mistake as Adam and Eve? They were born into a "perfect" world, walked with God, talked with God, etc. and they still fell into temptation.   Are you being judgmental? Are you sure that if you were Adam, you would not have eaten the fruit?  &gt; We can also look at Satan and see that even he need a "fruit" to eat from to fall into temptation/sin.  What is this "fruit" that Satan ate?	24

0	&gt; He did create beings of sinless nature. Those beings chose to rebel against Him  He didn't make a very good job of creating them sinless if they committed a sin.	24
0	The government can do whatever it likes, I just object to them claiming they are doing it out of some good will.  It's the threat of violence, they cannot escape that.	24
0	Win-win for me either way...I thought you use it that way. Don't you?	24
0	&gt;Just wondering what y'all think.  &gt;Edit: Let me rephrase slightly: "What is the very least I have to do to be saved?"  Have Faith in the sacrafice and resurrection of christ and that he paid for your son.	24
0	&gt; but those who are saved simply won't, because once the righteous have been in the presence of God,   But assuming that all angles were created equal, why was it Satan who decide to rebel?	24
0	eople who want to buy guns are adults and can make their own decisions and deal with the consequences. It is not the government's job to protect gun owners from their choices because they might regret them. See, those arguments aren't exclusive to medical procedures.  Also, there are states which allow for online consultations, so the whole "poor women won't be able to abort 'cause they can't go to clinics twice" argument doesn't neccessarily pose a problem to mandatory waiting period.	24
0	1) Recognize that you sinned against God by breaking His Laws (10 Commandments)  2) Confess your sins to Him and ask Him for forgiveness  3) Believe in Jesus Christ as your Savior alone.	24
0	Wealth redistribution through taxation is immoral.	24
0	That's like asking your wife,"Exactly how unfaithful can I be before you divorce me?"  -A redditor I forget the name.  Follow Jesus the best you can.  Luke 13:24 "Do your best to go in through the narrow door; because many people will surely try to go in but will not be able.	24
0	When I was a Christian, I also had trouble really convincing myself that life would go on after death. You're not the only one who has had these thoughts. I admire your intellectual honesty.	24
0	I think I've lost your point - not doing what is a crime?	24
0	I wasn't raised in a Christian home.	24
0	The government has a God-given right to tax (we see it in national Israel).  But you must have a different government than me if your government acts entirely for your benefit :)	24
0	What would that evidence look like to a millennial?	24
0	It can be billed as an investment, sure, fine.  But not as a Christian act.  Counter to what OP implied.	24
0	Couldnt we be the chosen on earth? Maybe we dont need to know about alien Jesus?	24
0	Confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe *in your heart* that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.   Romans 10:9    (emphasis added)	24
0	You must.  That will send you to hell.  Someone I know shared an article he had read about a man who claimed that he was set free from porn by meditating on Romans chapter 6. Maybe that'll help you.	24
0	Yeah, I could have posted something better :/  That's excellent. Thank you.	24
0	But healthcare costs money.  So, either you are paying more in taxes that you receive in benefits (in which case, the government is ripping you off) - or you get more benefits than you pay for (in which case, someone else is being forced to pay for you)...	24
0	**AMEN**    Rev. 17.	24
0	I think I definitely forgive them but there are always consequences of our actions..thus the justice part. David even had to suffer the consequences as well. The main part of forgiveness is that it is about rethinking the situation differently so that you won't hopefully do it again.	24
0	I don't see how coercive income redistribution promotes morality. Do you have any scripture that supports this or did you just feel like including your irrelevant personal views?	24
0	As I understand it, in Roman times there were notices at the boundary between the Court of the Gentiles and the Court of the Women, warning of a death penalty for gentiles who went any further. How would this interact with this code? The threat seems unusually blood-thirsty.	24
0	I love how some audacious prick in Europe with no political experience is telling us how to govern ourselves.	24
0	I'm not sure I think it has to do with how they interpret prayer, they believe it changes God's mind and if God's mind can be changed than He can't know everything.  If God can't know everything then He can't be all powerful.  Its a pretty frustrating discussion to have with them.	24

0	&gt;Not when the word “peace,” uttered by those of us who still cling to our unearned privilege, means peace for us and our kind.  How does being white make one's privilege unearned? How is violence the only possible recourse in this situation?  &gt;Not when peace means a return to the status quo, a resumption of normalcy—that is, privilege for us and discrimination for them.  * The president of the US is black * The attorney general is black * The mayor of Baltimore is black * The chief of police in Baltimore is black * Most of the Baltimore police department is black	24
0	To me, it seems to run about 50/50. Half the people complain that churches are not friendly. The other half complain that churches are aggressive.  The people of the Body of Christ are your relatives. You are supposed to love them, bless them and pray for them.  Are you too important to interact with them?	24

0	Submitting to one another in love is one of the major powers of the faith.  The enemy works hard to separate people because he is terrified of who they are once they function in unity. It is not a problem for the persecuted church. They aren't shy at all.	24
0	Better yet. Get rid of the idea of a pastor and just have a governing body. Maybe just elect a church president every year if you want. Most church organization is basically set up like a dictatorship, they're are hardly ever term limits or elections unless the current pastor chooses to leave.	24
0	Why didn't God make him not to be allowed on Earth as well?	24

You've ignored this and continue to point to it as an example of why cooperation isn't a positive. If only one side tries then it isn't cooperation. We would be much better off in terms of poverty if we cooperated. I don't even understand how that is contestable, but you've made it pretty clear that you aren't interested in reasonable discourse.	24

0	You do know that this is a war, right? And that all Christians are defenders of the faith and builders of the Kingdom of God, right? And you do know about the armor of God in Ephesians 6 and that it is to be worn and used at all times?  Our soldiers are seriously untrained and unaware of the mission.  Sad.	24
0	My dad (atheist) thought he to think critically and "don't act and think like a lot of those douchebag anti-theists and strong atheists." I got in really bad trouble with the Catholic church since my mom turned Catholic and forced me to go in my teens. I did something really not respectable among other things and my dad told me to as punishment to read the entire Bible and write a 50 page-essay about that....I went on to now became an Evangelical Christian. Critical thinking does the trick!	24
0	Lots of ways. Nah, I'd rather keep that to myself, thanks.	24
0	&gt;I think the orignal source for that story is the National Review, which in case you don't know is only a step above stormfront as far as balanced reporting goes  No. I have never heard that. It sounds like an ad hominem argument.	24
0	Yes. I have read articles on the National Review website. I disagree with you.	24
0	Oh. That's how it works.	24
0	I get that the guy disagrees with National Review's politics. That does not make them sketchy.	24
0	Where are the lies you were referring to?	24
0	Show me some of their lies. Not their political positions with which you disagree. Their lies.	24
0	&gt; Because partisan subjective reasons are inherently awkward and divisive.  Such is life in a pluralistic society.  Edit: It's certainly frustrating sometimes, I'll grant you, but I'm a strong proponent of the whole "I may disagree with what you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it" (paraphrasing, because lazy) idea.	24
0	Still waiting for your specific examples.	24
0	The Ordinate is enough. This isn't a major issue with any of the protestant faiths nor should it be focused on.	24
0	&gt;The supreme court rules on constitutional issues only. Tax exempt status is not a constitutional issue.   The article is not about the US Supreme Court weighing the issue of whether or not non-complying churches should be allowed to maintain their tax exempt status. Read the article.	24
0	I thought that's what it was. I really can't tell anymore, the situation has become so desperate.	24

0	People really should avoid talking about things that aren't in their field.  I've only heard a couple preachers/priests/popes/etc. say anything about politics that was worth listening to. Most make fairly basic errors in understanding the issues.	24

0	Which Church teaching is that? Please point me to the Church teaching that calls for open borders. At least Protestants can use the "interpretation" excuse for their nonsense.

Tax exempt status is not a constitutional issue.   .  &gt;Read my comments again.  I just did. You were addressing a straw man. I never said SCOTUS was going to rule on tax exempt status and neither did the article.	24
0	Because the Bible is a book, and Jesus is not a book. The conditions for rightness are not the same.	24
0	A mortal sin you say. First of all where does the idea of a mortal sin even come from (which thinkers were responsible for categorization and why?), how long after Christ did the concept develop, how did the penalties become arbitrarily established, and why should I believe this alleged sin deserves such theological condemnation?	24
0	God does not want us to check our brains at the door. We need to be able to apply our scepticism to everything. Why would he care if I wanted to better understand the rationale and history behind the creation of dogma? Otherwise we enter this circular sense of self-justification that is fundamentally illogical - Why is a given Catholic doctrine true established centuries after Christ? Well, tradition. Why does such subjective second order theological reasoning necessarily need to be binding? Well, tradition. Why is tradition a legitimate answer? Well, tradition. Do you not see how this is problematic?	24

0	Incorrect. However, those verses are heavily debated here. Many, including myself, do not see them as anti-lgbt.	24

0	He is addressing divorce, not marriage.	24
0	oh okay. If you see it link and I will delete it	24
0	I'm just saying, it's better to stick to what scripture **actually** says.	24
0	If the Church is relatable, it is not authentic, because an authentic 2000-year-old faith revolving around the physical manifestation of the Logos should leave you standing in the most uncomfortable sense of awe, even in a silent moment of reflection. You should sense the sacred. You should feel inferior. You should feel unimportant in the face of Being itself.  Doctors offices give you chairs and magazines to make you feel comfortable. Car dealerships offer you free coffee to make you feel comfortable. Restaurants offer you booths, lighting, and atmosphere to make you feel comfortable. Comfort is a selling point for a business, not the faith millions of martyrs died for.	24
0	You said Jesus was defining marriage, but He was telling people why they shouldn't get divorced.   It says God joined them together, it doesn't say it's because they had the correct genitals.	24
0	I'm not. Acts 15 is where it's explained.	24
0	Nobody said the Bible is more "accurate" than Jesus. Your problem is that you're thinking of a living, breathing person in the same terms as an inanimate book.	24
0	Race isn't real but the people you offend are PoC and it is ignorant for a white christian male to attack others.	24
0	"Seems", but it's only describing the sale of a sub-human.	24
0	What are you talking about?	24
0	Women and girls were only property at the time.	24
0	And I think that that is a problem. It's insulting at best, and outright suppression at worst. Diversity in this way can only help strengthen the church.	24
0	I'm really glad that you come down on Christian hypocrisy.  But I think it's lame that you're not able to have and enjoy sex for pleasure. As an atheist, I take moral issue with the indoctrination that fills normal sexuality with guilt.  Anyway, if it's working for you, I'll just thank you for being *consistent*. It's refreshing.	24
0	Both.  Also because they were... an "at-risk" population, who, by virtue of their existing marginalization, were otherwise unlikely to seek God out.	24

0	I there a term for someone who believes in the bible, but detests church-made doctrine and organized religion? I usually say I'm baptist, but that implies an association with baptist culture, which I have found to be shallow.	24
0	&gt;“It was not a statement against any one group in particular, you know what about the rights of the unborn babies,  the rights of children…"  Right.

0	&gt;vast majority of Christians in the world  Source? I thought it was charismatic / Pentecostal	24
0	I do not in any way regard you as an enemy. You are certainly not my enemy, because I am not gay.  But you and those who echo your views are an enemy to millions of gay people, who are not in your circumstances. People who simply want to get on with their lives without hearing hateful and ignorant things said about them.  These people are not hurting anyone and you should think very carefully before you go public with negative statements that can be so destructive and hurtful. Especially to young gay people.  Remember, you are dealing with human beings here. Not everyone is like you.	24
0	That's right, take the path of the Levite and the priest.   There's nothing for me to see here. It's nothing to do with me. Who cares if people are suffering. I'm on my way.  No matter how hard and frantically you try to wash your hands, you can't wash away the responsibility for hurting these people.	24
0	&gt; Stop worshipping money, stop whoring to the Republican party  I don't like the Republicans but when the official Democratic platform is the mass killing of innocents and the suppression of religion then there aren't many choices.	24
0	The past is not the present.	24
0	Are we supposed to apologize for the authenticity of our faith? Should we accommodate the pagan errors of Protestant belief? I grew up in Protestant denominations with this false concept of an invisible Church unity and tolerance of beliefs I disagreed with, but the truth is the truth. I'm not going to water it down just to make someone feel more comfortable. If you show up at my parish, you will be welcomed with open arms, but no one will accommodate heresy. Christianity is not an opinion poll, it's the death and resurrection of Christ.	24
0	Why give every penny to a church?  Jesus didn't tell you to give your money to churches.   Jesus however, said clearly, more than once:   Sell your possessions and give to the poor (the most ignored command in the entire Bible).   These are found in Luke 12:33 and Matthew 19:21.	24
0	&gt; Please stop bearing false witness and spreading lies.  I've done no such thing. The papacy holds the same view I do. [They even boast about it](http://amazingdiscoveries.org/S-deception-Sabbath_Sunday_Catholic_Church).  [Rome's Sabbath challenge to protestants](http://amazingdiscoveries.org/romes-challenge).  I will now be taking a shower and getting ready for church.	24
0	&gt; There is no witness of death and resurrection in that.  So what? That makes exactly zero difference to anything. A: just because some people believed X doesn't mean X is true, and B: why do you presume that this is a meaningful benchmark of validity? Is Sikhism, for example, necessarily invalid if it doesn't have a resurrection story? (I have no clue whether it does).  And on your last: what I am *against* is religions presuming (and leaning on privilege to assert) that the rules that apply to other people *do not apply to them*.	24
0	Oh, well if they've *prayed for good judgement*, I'm sure it'll all be fine... (rolls eyes)	24
0	I've only heard people be mostly indifferent or calling for more women ordained. I've never seen it compared to homosexuality.	24
0	...That is a damn good question.	24
0	Both. I consider causing unnecessary harm of animals just as bad, and sometimes worse if my emotions are driving me, because animals seem so much more innocent than humans most of the time.	24
0	People did remove all their teeth back in the days. Soldiers before going to war e.g. (this was obviously not the common thing, but it wasn't that uncommon either, and just to note that, it was only when artificial teeth were available).  Studies show direct correlations with STD infections. Just because those countries do not rank better doesn't mean that circumcision doesn't do what has been proven in studies. The correlation you are trying to make is like saying that blacks contract HIV better because countries in Africa have a higher infection rate.	24
0	The main reason you read online for non-medical circumcision are that they think it looks better, and some men are so sensitive that they ejaculate very fast. Circumcision let's them last longer and makes their sex life more fulfilling.  Edit: May I just ask here what qualifies my comment to be downvoted?  Edit 2: Nevermind, I forgot that reddit downvotes everything that is even slightly hinting that there are desired positive effects of circumcision.	24
0	That still doesn't defy the fact that you are just making a wide assumption while the studies took in plenty different factors to make sure that what they are trying to observe does stem from circumcision and not from other random factors. And nowadays there are definitly enough studies done to show those effects.	24
0	He called the Philokalia reductive.  Reductive.  What. The. F***.  That's why I can never return to the West. The arrogance of "it isn't deep enough for me" is everywhere and overwhelming. It's an infestation of sinful pride in the intellect.	24
0	It's not my denomination anymore, but double predestination was a thing for them.	24
0	It already makes sense just when thinking about it. A circumcised man has way more skin where the pathogens can hide, way more wrinkles where they can get stuck and multiply.  I can't find studies/sites with straight numbers, all just write in their conclusion that there higher/lower risk of whatever, but feel free to google yourself :)	24
0	You could calculate the numbers yourself by reading through the actual study, but I really don't care enough to do that :D  And I would agree/guess that immediate washing of your private parts greatly reduces and probably even neutralizes the difference between uncircumcised and circumcised, but then again, not every man does that.	24
0	Well, get to know a broader stripe of evangelical!	24
0	You should give the stolen merchandise back to where it came from.  Even if you just leave it on the store shelf.    As for the drugs, I know someone who can dispose of them.  You should give them to me.	24
0	You couldnt have explained it better! I find it funny how this sub has so many people that are atheist but just cant seem to stay away from /r/christianity, its kind of like they really want to belong but are too scared to admit that they may be wrong about what they believe. I think every time they come on here they get that "feeling" of belonging but dont want to admit it.	24
0	I'm currently attending to both Episcopalians and Catholic services.  So, some Catholic trads believe in a [prophecy](http://www.todayscatholicworld.com/great-catholic-monarch.htm) that's up there with Left Behind-worthy pentecostal futurism.  On the Episcopalian side, we have infamous practices like [this fuckery](http://www.matthewfox.org/the-cosmic-mass/).  Thankfully, none of this (the new-agey Episcopalian bullshit or the Catholic conservative delusions) can be attributed to those denominations as a whole, and are fringe beliefs everyday Episcopalians and Catholics also cringe about.	24
0	I know it's hard to believe it's not all about you...but it isn't.	24
0	This is such great news! Glad to have you back in the family :) praying for you brother/sister :)	24
0	Because legitimate spiritual experiences only come from a living God, not one that was made up by man. Go to YouTube and search for "healing in Jesus name" then search for "healing in muhammad name." In the first one you will find loads of people being instantly healed in the name of Jesus, in the second search you will find Muslims (and a guy named Mohammed) being healed in Jesus name. Jesus is the only way to salvation, there is no other name by which we can be saved.	24
0	Emotions are irrelevant, but I suppose mine would be something of a sadness. Delusions (of which atheism is one form of) are a hard thing for people to overcome.	24
0	Ugh, Alfredo sauce.	24
0	&gt; I don't mean to offend you but what if i said that Christianity was a delusion?  You would be wrong.  &gt; You have no way of validating the existence of god yet you dedicated your entire life to him.  I have sufficient evidence Catholicism is true, and have no doubts in that regard. Additionally, the existence of God is not only self-evident to humans (which is why the denial is always delusional), but also the *most proven* fact of reality.	24
0	Im pretty sure even a number of Christians here will agree that you are speaking out of your ass.	24
0	Catholicism never changes, so, yes, it's fair to say "pre-60s" or even "pre-5th century". The only things that have happened since, is false religions growing in number (and notably, the Modernist sect taking over political control of the Vatican, but that was in the 50s) - but these things don't change Catholicism.	24
0	I've done plenty of healings in Jesus name. There has never been a demon cast out that wasn't in Jesus name.	24
0	Firstly, those are points that are not my opinion.  Secondly, how you think a cut penis looks like compared to an uncut doesn't interest anyone, some people find it aesthatically more appealing and therefore do it. It's not rationalization, they think that before the procedure.  And that masturbation thing might be from decades ago? Never heard that point before.  But indeed, that father want sons to look alike is something that is also often a reason.	24
0	There are numerous Christian deliverance videos. I've done multiple and put one on youtube. None, and I mean none have been done by an Non Christians.  Not to be mean, a demonic belief system can't cast out demons. A house cannot be divided against itself as Jesus said. And IMO if there are Christian churches not operating with the power of Holy Spirit than they are just as useless as Muslims Hindus and countless others.	24
0	Anything ranging from "eh" to "where'd I leave mah scattergun?"  That's if it happened, because it almost never does.  I just never end up in those conversations for some reason.	24
0	Well they are deliverances. The Jews attempted exorcisms in the Bible and all of them were demonized. Thus, there is no active deliverance power and no videos proving of demons leaving someone in anyone claiming to not be using the power of Jesus. Any other belief system besides Christianity is demonically inspired and cannot go against itself.	24
0	Proving the entirety of Catholicism is no small task, so I unfortunately wouldn't have time to do that all myself (nor probably the skills to explain it properly, especially since I suck as saving references).  I could at best try to address some specific aspects of Catholicism, if that is helpful? (please specify which aspect(s), if so)	24
0	Neither.  As both groups are not saved.	24
0	No. It's greeting-card theology, or pop theology. It sounds saccharine and romantic, but has little to do with actual claims made by a religion.      Edit: Downvoters must have been touched by an angel.	24
0	Then you'd either believe a Deist view that God started the world and left it. Or you'd believe that God made the world(flawed), left it for billions of years of death and disease, sin...only to come back 2,000 years ago to suffer a horrible death for a planet of mutant beings He had little to no previous contact with	24
0	Giving an invitation is just fine. But why make people suffer?	24
0	Is it frowned upon to ask Christians questions?	24
0	Well, it was him who created the Earth. He could have created an earth that does not make its tectonic plates move unexpectedly, killing thousands of people as a result.   And yet he chose not to.	24
0	I'm curious about the opinions of Christians on certain issues that I've been wondering about myself.   How should I phrase my questions to make them acceptable?	24
0	Why do we even have discussions if everything had already been discussed?	24
0	But my question is not about a fact. It is about an opinion. Different Christians have different opinions on various issues. That is why I ask this question here.	24
0	Marriage is IDEALLY a covenant with God. Marriage approaches its fullest and deepest signification when it is a covenant with God. But the covenant is not the essential feature of the union. The essential feature of the union is male-female complementarity. It's perfectly possible for two atheists to have a valid marriage in the eyes of God, so long as one of the atheists is a man and the other atheist is a woman.	24
0	I do not know what is the reason for this? Why do Christians refuse to discuss certain issues?	24
0	But I want to learn. I want to learn from human beings who, by means of a discussion, can give me their explanations of the issues that I'm inquiring about.	24
0	Why can't I learn from people answering my questions?	24
0	So I cannot ask Christians questions because I don't have sufficient knowledge concerning Christianity?	24
0	Oh my, I love riddles!  Not really.   On a more serious note. Why are such simple questions causing such a fuss?  I simply asked why do God allow natural disasters. And instead of a response I'm attacked for asking the question. I simply wonder why.	24
0	Ah, I think you mixed up the two things I said :)  God's existence is:  * Self-evident * [Well-proven](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608b.htm#IB)  But the proofs themselves are not self-evident, only His existence. We have to search out the proofs if we want to make those a condition of accepting He exists. Furthermore, these proofs only deal with the *existence* of God, and do not address any questions about *which* God is the real God nor any other attributes of God. This is what I am referring to as the most proven.	24
0	Is "Why does God allow natural disasters that kill people to happen?" a low effort question?	24
0	But when I ask a person a question I don't ask about the many many opinions. I ask about the person's opinion.   If I asked you a question:  Is vaccinating children right?  Would you respond by saying: There are many, many answers written about that that you could easily read?	24
0	But would I learn what your opinion is that way?	24
0	IMO, this wave of anti-circumcision is just the latest face for anti-semitism, especially with all the support it gathers in Northern Europe.	24
0	I'm interested in learning what other people think. That is why I ask questions.   I'm perfectly fine with people deciding not to give their opinions by not answering questions. This is their right. I full respect that.  But when you respond to a question, I would love to hear a personal opinion. And I cannot understand why people are sometimes so reluctant to give one.	24
0	You sure he wouldn't just be transferred to another diocese?	24
0	I apologize, I did not word that well. That's true, but I still don't understand why a person would pray to another dead person, regardless of who they were in life.	24
0	I want to learn the opinions of people that I ask the question to.	24
0	/s means that the text was meant sarcastic. So you don't have to guess if it's sarcastic or not, never easy with texts.	24
0	How could someone possibly know how to break death by works? Plus, what evidence do we have of those people are breaking death, none! Works or keeping strict adherence to laws to break death or get to Heaven is just what a human would invent. That is true religion!	24
0	That makes sense, however isn't prayer an earthly communication with God? When you die, you are already with God and can speak to him directly. Also, if all are created equal, it doesn't matter who's who after death. Just a thought.	24
0	People do a lot of things because they are told its true by a specific religious belief, that doesn't make it right and effective. Nowhere in the Bible does it say to pray to anyone other thanGod himself.	24
0	Based upon what? They were human, just like us.	24
0	Those verses just say he is the God of the living. He absolutely is, but everyone dies an earthly death. This refers to everyone being alive, but in a spiritual way. They are still physically dead.	24
0	If God likes opposite-sex marriage and dislikes same-sex marriage, then why should the religious beliefs of the couples even be relevant? Being a Christian doesn't automatically make everything you do holy, and being an atheist doesn't automatically make everything you do unholy. You need to judge each act on its own merits.	24
0	If you look at my flair you'll see an atheist. The way you asked seemed like you were curious on what religion I was before I became an atheist so that is why I answered how I did.   Now the way you've worded things has made me wonder. Are you some type of theist?	24
0	Christianity is an eastern religion.	24
0	I am just tired of the wonderful, powerful members of the Body of Christ, who are entrusted with the Glory of building the Kingdom of God here on Earth, sit on the sidelines and moan.  They seem to have know idea who they are in Christ, and are living out their diagnosis.  Everybody has one these days.  If they only knew how terrified Hell is of them! If they could only see the demons shake when they speak their words in power!  But they are just dragging through life and the battles that they could be winning are lost. They are suffering without cause.  It is awful.	24
0	This is infuriating. For all you Christians saying f*** /u/emprags  If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person’s religion is worthless. (‭James‬ ‭1‬:‭26‬ ESV)  Yes. Worthless.	24
0	That is explained in the Bible. The short version is heaven is a home for the spiritually alive, hell is the end for the spiritually dead. Everyone dies a physical death, but those who follow Christ live (spiritually) eternally.	24
0	This is what the bible says about non Christian marriages:  2 Corinthians 6:14 KJV [14] Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?  And for the question of homo/hetero marriages:  Genesis 2:23-24 KJV [23] And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. [24] Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.	24
0	So you're a Christian yet type out this:   &gt; How could someone possibly know how to break death by works? Plus, what evidence do we have of those people are breaking death, none! Works or keeping strict adherence to laws to break death or get to Heaven is just what a human would invent.   I just can't wrap my mind around the irony of such a statement to be honest.    On a side note: Welcome to Reddit	24
0	The resurrection is a completely separate topic because Jesus was God. All humans die physically, which he did as well, but he returned because he is not bound to the physical death of the enemy like we are.	24
0	That's true, however some of these principles seem to contradict things said in the Bible itself. Praying to anyone other than God is idolatry by my belief, and this is mentioned multiple times.	24
0	It's not about the joke behind it. It's the blatant ignorance of scripture telling us to keep our mouths clean which has plagued /r/Christianity.	24
0	Yes. I was a rabid, foaming-at-the-mouth atheist who spend most of my energy working against Christianity and advancing LGBT issues. I tried to get the Bible banned from my city. Tried to get churches closed down. Tired to get a Christian radio station off the air.   Then a coworker told me about Christ. He was also gay and had become a Christian, which I didn't know until he told me (I knew he was gay; didn't know he was a Christian). He showed me the evidence that lead him to believe and I could not deny the truth any longer.	24
0	How could someone possibly know how to break death by faith? Plus, what evidence do we have of those people are breaking death, none! Faith to break death or get to Heaven is just what a human would invent.	24
0	You rebuke them in the name of Christ. Devil's whispering in your ear is a problem many people have. Read the Screwtape Letters. It's a fictional look at what happens to many Christians. Ask other people to pray against those spirits as well. The devil may be beaten, but much like Germany in 1944, he sure has heck doesn't know it.	24
0	You clearly don't understand Christianity if you're telling us to leave scripture out of a discussion.	24
0	&gt; Other people have faith in themselves and their works but Christianity is all about faith in God.   I think you're misrepresenting things. Just because Christianity is faith &gt; deeds doesn't make those who are deeds &gt; faith less about God and more about themselves.   Regardless, just because Christianity is different in *that* regard doesn't it not a religion like you're subtly alluding to to. Religions, across the board, have countless similarities as well as differences.	24
0	TL;DR version:  I was atheist/evolutionist.  Now I am a fundamentalist christian.  Math was a big reason - certain parts of evolution have math that disagrees directly with evolution, then I met a christian that wasn't an asshole.  EDIT: Plenty of my posts piss people off, but I literally answered OP's question. Why the downvotes here of all places?	24
0	Elijah and Moses were transfigured (along with Enoch), though. They are special cases.  Everyone else is dead awaiting the resurrection.	24
0	&gt; Because you seldom if ever acknolwedge that opinion. Instead, you just ask another question.  So if we discuss and issue and you and I have different opinions, is it inappropriate to ask questions?	24
0	No marriages but Christian marriages are valid.   All other marriages are just people fornicating and all their children are illegitimate and are condemned forever by the stain of their parents sin!  Even the adopted ones!   (so there. )	24
0	Go ahead and think that	24
0	So if a person asks questions, it means that such a person does not want to learn?	24
0	Brilliant, as long as the profane can't understand it!!!  I'm gonna spend the night researching the esoteric qualities of KJV.   Don't the first few lines have a Bacon anagram? Maybe I'm thinking of a Shakespear work.	24
0	James talks about *the prayer of a righteous availing*. So it's probably more of an exercise in broad sampling than in poll taking: trying to engage the relative few who will be persuasive.	24
0	Have a great time!	24
0	Both of them have supported genocide in the past.	24
0	Doesn't the Pope have any faith?	24
0	No, there is a hell. Jesus says so, Old Testament justifies and testifies to Jesus. The golden rule depends on acts of good will, but all are criminals/sinners who have done wrong.	24
0	The bible does not support the doctrine of eternal torment in Hell!   http://www.ecclesia.org/truth/hell.html	24
0	I would say that the only unforgivable sin is unrepentant sin.	24
0	See? I told you you could find an excuse. As I said, I've heard all kinds.	24
0	If it is not a universal negative, doesn't it mean that it can be challenged by, well for instance, asking questions and having a discussion?	24
0	It was never mentioned before the 1700s, it's a safe assumption.	24
0	They treated one person as a groom, and one as a bride. That's not gay marriage.	24
0	And only then will I understand what issues should not be discussed?	24
0	Gay marriage isn't about utility.	24
0	Jesus said the greatest commandment after loving God above all is to love your neighbor as yourself. Christians generally - by an enormous margin judging from the lack of any push-back whatsoever among U.S. Christians - don't know this and think worshipping the wealthy and wanting only to be one of them and hating everyone not wealthy, white, male and heterosexual, including themselves, is the highest commandment. Prove me wrong with lots and lots of citations of millions and millions of U.S. Christians loving their neighbors of all colors, creeds and classes above themselves and/or those above them on the U.S. race, class, sexual preference and color privileged hierarchy.	24
0	That's not the same. They don't have two brides or two grooms. One person had to be "dominant" and the other "submissive". Now we consider men and women equal. There doesn't have to be a man and a woman in every wedding because neither are treated as property anymore.	24
0	Well, that's the reason it lets them last longer, the penis is less sensitive. Yet you read from many people that had the procedure done with prior sexual experience that it's not that much of a loss that you lose every sensory input you have. Depending on the study, only 20% even report a decline in sensation.  Your text is all neurologically speaking and really can't be debated because it's true what you've written. But sex is way more than just that.	24
0	No he doesn't. Its a canard that a lot of unscrupulous people like to perpetuate. Hes addressed it many times	24
0	Love it! Christians can select the version of the Bible that's closest to their comfort zone! So many versions, there's bound to be one that suits every un-Christian discrimination, hatred and sin-committing!	24
0	Yes, but anyone who is actually familiar with the ancient rome and greece understands exactly what he is criticizing ad is familiar with.  Paul was a man of his times, and everything he says must be viewed through that lens.  He is clearly referingto ancient instution of pedaresty.  When you read ancient texts, you can't project the present onto it, which is what church scholars have done in the past, and many are currently doing now.   And I would disagree that there are complicated cultural reasons why people think being gay is ok now.  People understand that most gay people are just people like us, only attracted to members of the same sex.	24
0	Sounds like you need to suck on a little boy's mutilated penis to cheer you up! Rabbis do it all the time — so it must be OK eh?  Added bonus - the baby gets HERPES!  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2304793/Two-babies-stricken-HERPES-ritual-oral-blood-sucking-circumcision-New-York-City.html  And this Rabbi cut the glans of the little boy's penis off, and then sucked the stump! Why don't you have a wank to this story LOL:  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/20/rabbi-mordechai-rosenberg_n_4482567.html	24
0	Oh nooes! The Jews would have a field day though.	24
0	No need to be sensitive.   Perhaps he just hit a raw nerve and you are at heart looking for God but have not found Him yet.	24
0	A non-Christian man and woman can get married in a "natural" marriage.  This is not sacramental, but it is marriage (for example, they are not fornicating).  A baptized man and woman, if they get married, have a "sacramental" marriage.  This is true if they are Catholic or otherwise.  If one is baptized and the other is not, then it is natural.  Two persons of the same-sex cannot have a natural or sacramental marriage.	24
0	Are you posting this to try and justify fornication and sin as somehow acceptable.	24
0	Not attempting to be. Most people are unaware that there are apostolic churches in India as well as Africa.	24
0	Yes -Jesus wants to give you a blow job. Now that's a fact!	24
0	The people whose form won out through violence and then pretend it was some kind of process of well thought out scholarship that was constantly reaffirmed in an honest and open fashion who then exclude everyone else, by now only verbally, despite their on version including a lot of content they made upa after the fact have a tenuous claim. There's definitely many parts of the Bible where Jesus places himself below God.	24
0	That is what spirits would want you to believe. There is only one way and Spirits would manipulate that to create 50 ways. Thus people who said there is only one way would be labelled intolerant even though there truly is only one way.  Jesus said narrow is the gate and strait is the way to the kingdom of God. Watch out - not having a relationship with God opens your mind to lies.	24
0	I think you should keep in mind that despite doctrinal differences of mainline Christianity and Mormonism, most practicing Mormons and practicing Christians have strikingly similar beliefs about God and how He interacts with their life, about prayer and morality, and about most social and personal issues.	24
0	We give our authority to  a demon when we sin.  Sin can only occur at the thought that a demon gives (which is our flesh)	24
0	truly demons are just dogs on a leash for God. If it wasn't for demons tempting me I'd never be as close to Dad in Heaven as I am today.  I am in relationship with Dad. So basically I know his will and I obey to it. That's the point of Jesus ministry. He lived in oneness with our Father by Holy Spirit. We do the same and walk like Jesus walks in pure love towards him and others.	24
0	Even when I was a christian I knew parts of the Bible were not true. I always questioned. In sunday school as a child someone would teach us something and my hand inevitably shot up and said something along the lines of "how?" Why?"	24
0	In his eyes you are trying to justify sin.   All bullshit to begin with in my eyes, if I were to come out of the closet as gay (straight here) I wouldn't give a fuck if people judged me. If they dont like How I was then fuck them	24
0	Check out the Adam-God Doctrine. (Spoiler alert: Adam was God).	24

0	No, [he is a confirmed troll.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/3432jn/16_year_old_male_who_never_watched_porn/cqqxblj)  Look at how a comment of his was removed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/34mgbf/just_for_fun_who_is_your_favourite_saint/) for attempting to get a rise out of people, so he waited a few hours and then reposted the exact same comment.	24
0	I didn't make up anything about canonization this time.	24
0	I was talking about Protestant dissenters.  That's what "Dissenters" usually meant, well into the 1800's.  But even so, if you count up the different sects, the one Roman Catholic Church was clearly outnumbered. ;)	24
0	It's all politics. Any President wants to appear a foreign policy success, and having an Iraqi nun there to talk about the negative consequences of us leaving that country does the President no favors.	24
0	That God throws most of humanity in the same lake of fire that he does Satan. I never realized how much God hates most of his creation that He would cause them to suffer the same fate as Satan himself.	24
0	The problem is this has almost no basis anywhere. It is said He descended into Hell but I would assume it's to pay for humanity's sin rather than to preach the gospel to the dead.	24
0	That's something that's completely speculation. I'm assuming you're coming from a sola scriptura standpoint being Lutheran and all, in which case that theory has as much basis as the theory that Jesus was a false prophet sent to test humanity by Satan.	24
0	*edit   deleted a weird duplicated post.	24
0	We know Jesus went to Hell, we have little to no idea what happened in Hell. Jumping to the conclusion that He preached to the dead in hell is a bit of a stretch, and doesn't appear to have much if any biblical basis	24
0	Hence through sola scriptura this not really being supportable. But then you are Luthanglicathodox...	24
0	Yeah, the Independant, the Guardian and the New York Times are trolls as well.	24
0	I had to go to church pretty much every Sunday for around 14 years of my life. I never understood why. It doesn't really make sense why I would have to go to praise God and renounce my sins. I was taught that God is always around and is always listening, so why wouldn't I be able to do it at home on my own time.   You don't have to go to church to believe in God. If it bores you, find something that doesn't.  God isn't gonna hate you if you don't go.	24
0	So in a parallel universe Arians might be the dominant religion?	24
0	You're critiquing my reasoning. That's a direct quote from the Didache.  Nonconformity is sometimes helpful, sometimes toxic. Disagreements on a medical treatment approach may b healthy, but not if they veer into abject quackery for the sake of being l'edgy as, for example Shuck or Spong (who I know is out of office) do.	24
0	That's modalism, Patrick. Or partialism. Take your pick, depending on what words are being emphasized. Emphasizing sharing of essence isn't beyond controversy when you're making sure to emphasize them being distinct entities. At that point, the sharing of essence is barely a meaningful distinction. Its really special pleading to think Jews won't have a problem with it.	24
0	Reliability doesn't mature with age, it's not like a fine wine.	24
0	Daniel 9 is actually not what people think it is, but I think i'll just go with the flow on this and not stir the pot too much.  I like Daniel 11 as well.  Isaiah 17, and Isaiah 19 are gettin close to fulfillment.. its an exciting time... Damascus is getting closer to a heap of ruins everyday.	24
0	What reasoning did the Arians use to come to their conclusion?	24
0	Thank you, Mr. Erhman.   But Jesus was a biblicist and a literalist. I'm going with him.   As for how the church should look, just read the book of acts. If your church doesn't look like that, and there is no speaking of tongues, no miracles, no wonders, no laying on of hands, then you are doing it wrong.  I really think Christians make it a whole lot harder than it needs to be.	24
0	There are very few circumstances, but yes it is possible.  Here's one very specific way: [Revelation 14:9-12]	24
0	Yes   Source: it happened to me	24
0	Nah.  If you are connecting with him, that's all that matters. I haven't been to a church in about 6 years now and i don't regret that at all. Explore on your own, I became much closer to him once I did.	24
0	The problem with the second videos is that the arguments against homosexuality aren't really any better than shitty internet blogs. And the ceremonial division is not only arbitrary, and not really something that existed in judaism, but arbitrary in the larger sense in that its rationalizing gibberish laws by saying they were a long time ago, and were just to make them different. Which they weren't, since every culture had laws like that.	24
0	No. That's basically made up by people who knew other people would be too lazy to check.	24
0	If you "lost" it, then you never had it. Your salvation should be dependent on following him and constant repentance, and most importantly, his power, payment, and forgiveness.	24
0	I believe science is right and God created with 'the snap of His fingers'. Seems like a contradiction? Let me explain my opinion on this. God spoke the universe into existence, like Genesis tells us. He created the tree, not the seed and he created the chicken, not the egg. So when science tries to backtrack to the seed, surely they will find billions of years, but that's not how it happened. God didn't say:let there be light and then sat down for billions of years to see a star clumping together from dust. You can't always extrapolate your data to time t=0.	24
0	God loves people, but if they reject Him then He'll casts them into the lake of fire to be tormented day and night forever and ever without rest?  What kind of love is that?	24
0	&gt;What Bible Passages have most **effected** your life?  *affected	24
0	Yeah, and the interpretation can always be slightly tweaked when new evidence comes about so it still makes sense.	24
0	The key question is how can it be believed	24
0	Times haven't changed that much. The KJV is still one of the best bibles around.  A lot of people actually find it easier to understand than many so-called 'modern' versions.	24
0	If you prefer to use the KJV, that's your business. But don't go around telling people that the KJV is the only "acceptable" Bible and all other versions are corrupt.	24
0	Any "inaccuracies" contained within the KJV are mere etymological oddities. That doesn't really equate to inaccuracy.	24
0	Or they have a philosophy which allows for non-Christian marriages but not ones of the same sex.  You know, most of them.	24
0	Ok so go ahead and read the qu'ran too using the same principle.  You will end up with a big problem.	24
0	Usually people who are like "the kjv is better than modern versions!!!" are kjv-only.	24
0	You will still end up believing both the qu'ran and the bible.	24
0	&gt;no longer Christian/no longer shared your beliefs?   This is actually two different things. I am a Christian but I no longer hold the overly Protestant views of my parents and family.  If my kids told me they were no longer Christian I can only do two things 1) pray for them, and 2) do some soul searching about where I failed them as a parent.	24
0	Yes you can.  I can seek meaning in Star trek or harry potter too.  But neither of those are claiming to be divinely inspired and thus the truth.  I really don't understand the purpose of the point you are trying to make.	24
0	They are obviously linked.   If i told you I just had a conversation with Asherah would you believe me?	24
0	Whenever I see the promulgation of the idea that there is such a thing as "The Church", yes I do.  When I was attending seminary and learned the history of the early Christian Church it was a shock to me to learn about the underhanded and frankly unethical machinations that were used to falsely claim Biblical authority by what has become the Catholic and Orthodox schisms of Christianity.   Someday you may be exposed to enough information to change your thinking on it too.    In the meantime its not surprising to see people reacting to the  idea with some emotionality as it is quite disturbing information.	24
0	No. When you're saved, you're adopted as a son (Ephesians 1) and made a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). You can't be made illegitimate or be unmade into your old self.  For those who considered themselves "christians" then no longer believe, they were never sons. They were never made new. They may have conformed to dead religion or duty or had warm feelings about God, but that doesn't mean that they knew him.   The good news is that they still can - I went to church with my parents my whole life, but didn't meet Jesus until I was 24.	24

0	You presume where I do not.  To presume is to not even ask the question.  Why are you presuming anything?	24
0	There is so much truth in the saying that “if God is all you have, then you have got all you need.” This is because if we allow God have full control of our lives, He will manifest His power in every area of our needs.	24
0	But the old testament is the old covenant. Christians are following the new covenant.	24
0	The idea that the morality of God doesn't change is not true according to christianity because the morality of the new covenant is different than the morality of the old covenant.	24

0	One could say infants who are raised evil, have a high chance of being evil? Maybe good would rather let the infant not to be raised by evil but, recreate him/her? Similar to Noahs ark? Yeah, I think I'll have to talk this one with my pastor.	24
0	I'm all for egalitarianism, but the reality of academia (at least as I preceive it) is that it is a vertical society.	24
0	Well at least you're being honest. That's a good sign.	24
0	Well now you know.	24
0	I must have read too deeply because it all seemed like nonsense to me.	24
0	It is when the resolution results in denial of the gospel.	24
0	In essence this is genocide, not just infanticide.  You are excusing the Israelites from the killing of the men and women but not the children? The Israelites were wiping out entire people groups.    In reality, God is way too big and His ways so far above us that we can never understand all His reasons for doing things if any reasons at all. 1 Corinthians 2:11.  His ways are higher than ours, we can't understand them, our minds aren't capable of it.	24
0	Children of that age were a full part of that society. They were Amelikites, along with everything that implies. I think we forget how early people came of age in that time and comparatively late we come of age nowadays. The things the Amalikites were guilty of the teenagers were guilty of too. And once they knew right from wrong they had the awareness to be responsible for choosing those ways.	24
0	Perhaps it would be more palatable if you think of it as taking the unproven supernatural elements out of Christianity. Similar to Humanism in the way it relies on much the same morals and ethics as Christianity, but without the use of a deity. That's not such a bad thing as you might imagine it.	24
0	God wouldn't have done that. God hardened Pharaoh's heart, because Pharaoh didn't want to let people go. God had to create the circumstances to let Pharaoh do what Pharaoh wanted.  *** EDIT ***  See my comment below for a correction. Sorry.	24
0	You've just said you understood right from wrong at 10. So which is it? Are they able or not? How were you able but they were not? Are you exempt from your cultural influences somehow?	24
0	A view that I heard says that they were killed, because they were half-breeds. I'm not talking about skin colours. I'm talking about fallen angels mixing with humans and animals.	24
0	Do you really need an overseer to make you treat others well? I'd argue that a true intellectual appreciation of working for the common good is more durable than one based on unproven supernatural suppositions.	24
0	[I don't need to try to justify it,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/34pxgn/how_can_i_love_a_god_that_told_people_to_kill/cqwz82c?context=3) it is perfectly justified in my eyes.	24
0	Form your own opinions on the world and be prepared to back them up with evidence. Don't just blindly ask for help because you're too lazy to do your own research.	24
0	Well, for me **personally**, even if God *did* exist, if he was as morally bankrupt as the bible made him out to be, I wouldn't want to worship him, nor would I be able to love him even if I tried. If anything, I'd probably want to be sure I got sent to hell, just so I wouldn't have to endure him for eternity. I don't know where I was going with this	24
0	It was so fake. And so backwards. Stopped going after three months.	24
0	Thats the point, God's ways are so much higher than ours that our tiny human brains can't understand it.  Thats why we don't.  No one knows why He told them to kill all those people.  But you can ask in heaven someday	24
0	Not all parts of the Bible are from God, despite it saying so.  It's not inerrant, it's not a single book, and it was written by people, not God.  You gotta put in the time (years maybe) to figure out what's what.	24
0	I don't see a cult of personality type adherence that enduring either. Especially when information about that personality is based almost entirely on hagiographies and other adoring idealizations.	24
0	It doesn't have anything to say in particular about this specific topic, but it does have a lot to say about what a Christian, God pleasing, marriage consists of, and when a marriage consists of a non-Christian, it makes adhering to God's word difficult - but not impossible. Simply put, there will be additional challenges in such situations for the Christian.	24
0	I don't want to be mean but if she has no interest in converting then it's really against God to go through with anything. I know you definitely love her but I know someone who literally was engaged and about to be married and converted to Christianity and his fiance was even a Christian but was Eastern Orthodox and did not want to follow Jesus or anything related to biblical Christianity.   He split up with her and now he is happily married with someone who is a born again Christian. Remember, God will see the sacrifices you make for him and really appreciates it.	24
0	I would, as they are higher moral powers than myself. You can downvote me all you want for it, but that's simply the truth we are called to accept and believe in.	24
0	Those children probably would have died a horrible death when the plague hit Egypt anyways. Maybe god was sparing them from that.	24
0	Before anything I would ask our Father in Heaven about the situation. He will definitely respond, it's important to Him. Then I believe you should ask Father to show his love for her from you and in do so glorify His name.   To be honest with you just flow with God. It's really organic and He loves her so much. You don't have to prepare anything or try to get her in a corner, just ask God to show his love and I've noticed that people who are not Christians love that the most. Flow with your heart because he lives inside of it :)	24
0	Very inspiring.  Nice way to inspire more people to give you more of their money.  Honestly, this just looks like a marketing campaign to guilt people into giving more money.  The best part in the video is the ending, when she says that "the church wants this person to know the nickel and the dime and the three pennies you left.... counts", then it stops. The church doesn't go on to say how they're spending that donation in a way that it will give back to the community.  It "counts". It counts to make the church richer.	24
0	There is nothing in the bible covering this topic specifically, it will only let you know what a marriage should be.	24
0	Do you really think a child raised to be evil will become good? Yes a miracle may happen. Yeah let's just force them to become good. Is that free will?	24
0	Which is how false doctrine like limited atonement have come into being - a fundamental denial of the gospel.	24
0	Side topic, where does it say a mans sins can not be transferred to his sons? If I recall, weren't the paleo-palestinians essentially condemned to be warlike for the rest of eternity or something?	24
0	And yet somehow the first society to ever not have this evil definition was the Netherlands in 2001?	24
0	I don't believe God's "goodness" means toleration, which would in fact actually make him not good anymore.  But his goodness and perfection means the complete negation and cleansing of all sin, whichever way that means.	24
0	I read enough to recognize that you believe in Christianity as a social apparatus. You are willing to overlook its zealotry for the supernatural because it is familiar.	24
0	Okay, great. Nice job cherry picking two exact quotes and completely ignoring the rest of my argument whilst simultaneously attacking me as a human being.   I wish there were a polite way to say "get over yourself", but get over yourself.	24
0	These might be all interesting texts, but I find it hard to understand why we must listen to theologians and various authors who are experts in the study of the bible - to be able to understand the bible. A text which acts as a guide for how to live a good life should be quite a bit easier to read, I think.	24
0	I'm asking you, do you think that every society ever was intolerant until 2001?	24
0	Nice. Thanks man. Have a blessed day.	24
0	So you admit that it is a change from the norm over human history?	24
0	&gt;God wants that all (even the Amalekites, Sodomites, those mass murderers we were condemning the other day) should repent and have eternal life.  [No.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVrRlevPrtI)	24
0	Then how do we know that those people weren't a month away from having super-ebola spread through their ranks and kill them all anyways through weeks and weeks of dehydration? How do we know those people wouldn't rally and become conquerers who would birth the most evil man in eternity? We don't know. We simply can't understand the process that would have lead to it happening. He can.	24
0	So considering that, why should a change have been made?  What is the positive reason for it?	24
0	Okay, I disagree with you, and many Christians would as well, but frankly really don't feel like being called a fucking terrorist anymore, so have a nice day.	24
0	What of the argument that marriage is a procreative institution (I'm trying to write a paper now, so sorry if my comments are a little short).	24
0	No... When did God say that infants go to hell? And I didnt say they were evil, I said they WERE GOING to become evil. But he saved them.	24
0	&gt;I think that the real purpose of marriage if a couple chooses to have children is raising and supporting them, not simply giving birth to them.   And why is an understanding more geared to the birthing of children bigoted?	24
0	But we deserve to be smote	24
0	Why can the society not base its definition of marriage on procreative capability?  If that is the definition, then there is no reason (even putting aside considerations of the morality of the acts involved itself) that same-sex couples should gain those benefits.	24
0	How can we as a creation define the creator evil? That idea, that we can doesn't make sense to me.  To define something as evil, we have to have an idea of what good is in opposition to that evil. So the idea of an evil Creator doesn't make sense to me.	24
0	Arguments about how things *should* be, according to you or someone else, are not particularly solid. Most things in this world are complex and strange when you get to their inner workings, and not at all how you would expect they should be.	24
0	&gt; perfectly decent people  DO NOT EXIST.  I don't know how many times this needs to be said here. I honestly believe we should make Romans 3:10-12 the header of this subreddit.	24
0	Two things:  1. As to infertility, false declarations of infertility happen all the time.   Further, there is a strong argument that the state should not have those records.  2. As to the elderly, the definition takes into account procreative capacity.  Two elderly people can still (hypothetically) procreate if not prevented by old age.  This is not true for persons of the same-sex, who can never procreate even in ideal circumstances.  The government knowledge of medical details argument still applies here too.	24
0	&gt;And if it really is just procreation, and adoption does not count, then are those who adopt somehow lesser families that are not worthy of being held together by marriage?  I don't see why not.  As I said, it is based on the ability of the sex act to be procreative without defects (age, infertility etc.) preventing it.	24
0	Well can you answer my question?	24
0	Would that be any better? Wouldn't you still be able to blame God like people do for Noah's flood or Sodom and Gomorrah?	24
0	It is based on the capacity to have sexual intercourse with at least the possibility of children without defects.  Totally impotent (note the distinction between this and infertile) people would be excluded as well.  It is not based on sex alone (although that is obviously important).	24
0	Our god is a jealous God. He wanted to punish these people.	24
0	&gt;And just to get this straight, an impotent couple that adopts children and raises them as a family should not be allowed to base that family on a marriage?  If at the time of marriage there is no possibility of completed vaginal intercourse, then no.  This is the long-standing position of the Catholic Church, and I suspect that Catholic countries prior to the 1920s followed a similar definition in law.  Due to the wide availability of divorce, any situation where impotence would have been grounds for an *annulment* in law have probably been replaced by simple divorce.  You must at least admit that this definition is consistent.	24
0	All of the nonsensical bits, which is to say, most of it.	24
0	I would take up the crusade if it was asked of me.	24
0	Vaginal intercourse is an act related to the procreation of children.  As to equal protection, the courts have admitted that all that is needed is a "rational basis."  Preventing out of wedlock births is a state interest (which isn't relevant to persons of the same-sex), so the law passes there.  Nor does the law need to be the most narrowly tailored way to achieve that goal, it can be as broad (including the infertile and elderly) or as narrow as it likes *legally*.	24
0	That's also a fair assumption to be honest   EDIT: Really not sure where the downvotes are from, man. I told you that it was a fair enough interpretation	24
0	It doesn't matter so much to me as being born again and following Jesus. If you're not in relationship with our Father by worshipping in Spirit then you're missing out	24
0	As I said, the state doesn't need to justify its exclusion of same-sex couples under rational basis review.  All they need is an interest rationally related to the current classification.  Since sexual orientation is not normally read into in the 14th Amendment, their exclusion doesn't place them into any higher degrees of legal scrutiny requiring a reason for exclusion.  Further, the belief (and, as the Supreme Court ruled, the evidence or lack thereof to support such a belief is irrelevant.  No legal debate can be had about the actual truth of this statement under rational basis review) that opposite sex couples make better parents also satisfies rational basis review.	24
0	I know that the church is not a physical place only. We are the body of Christ but you only belong to the body if you follow the One at the head.  If you don't have Holy Spirit guiding you how do you know what our Father's will is over your life?	24
0	It's not just forgiveness of sins. Its asking for baptism in the Holy Ghost. You truly know when you are baptized in the Holy Spirit...one example is that you will start speaking in tongues.	24
0	Nope. I wrote it where I wanted to. I'm loyal to my church. If the Pope asked me to take up crusade I would.	24
0	The intelligence available at the time the war in Iraq started gave him a good reason to think Iraq was harboring al-Qaeda fugitives.  Osama bin Laden turned out to be hiding in Pakistan. How was anyone supposed to know Iraq under Saddam Hussein wasn't doing the same thing?  Granted, the war went on way, way too long after we knew Iraq had nothing to do with al-Qaeda, but the initial declaration of war seems justifiable.	24
0	It was a valid comparison.	24
0	He doesn't have to argue from a position of power to represent something that is common to the human race, and power can derive from strength in numbers, which is how a tyranny of a majority operates.    But, seriously, the "art" he seems to hate definitely appears to be doing its job effectively.  He's become part of the show, and that in and of itself is fascinating.	24
0	I follow Holy Spirit, not churches.	24
0	I've always been told by fundamentalists that everything God did was leading to Jesus so it's all good in the long run.	24
0	I know Father God wants relationship with his children and he said that those that believe will prophecy cast out devils heal the sick and most importantly know him.  Whatever church isn't doing that just means they truly do not believe. It's nothing against these people or any hatred it's just the truth.	24
0	One doctorine they have is praying to saints or using them for intercession. That's false because we can only pray to our Father directly. In fact using the name of a saint in the Spirit realm means you pray to a demon. You can't pray to demons and say you follow our Father.	24
0	demons have no authority over Jesus.	24
0	I've lost loved ones and found that comforting. It is God's plan, my son and my friend and my grandmother all died because of God's plan. So I don't really know what you want me to say, but I'm not apologizing for that.	24
0	&gt;It is an anthology if man's interactions with God, singularly focussed on the topic of salvation  Doesn't that topic benefit from discussion, even in broad strokes, about the history of God's people in recent centuries? Doesn't the ignorance of that history hinder or endanger the comprehensive nature of salvation?  We have obviously changed our perspective on theological concepts. Why are those changes not important to discussion of our salvation? Not reflected in our texts?	24
0	I do, but I think being guilty in the sense of original sin is not the same as being accountable.	24
0	Well, so long as it doesn't show up on my doorstep uninvited, and if it serves to upset, challenge and uproot the false ideals of life, holiness, and uprightness that have been reinforced and perpetuated by the non-Christian philosophies and preferences of a classical Western culture that has dominated and destroyed lesser communities for thousands of years, I'm not going to complain.	24
0	if you don't speak in a tongues you do not have Holy Spirit.  Paul by the way was talking about tongues in a church. Worshipping in tongues is one of the best ways to get to know our Father. Everyone baptized in the Holy Spirit spoke in tongues in the day of Pentecost.	24
0	Anything against God is demonic meaning that is truth and who is the Spirit of truth? Holy Spirit.	24
0	The point is, that they don't *have* to prove that their interest will really happen.  Although I think it would, I have no obligation to demonstrate that legally.  That's *FCC v. Beach Communications.*	24
0	I can't claim to know the answer to that question, but I don't really see a wild difference	24
0	You're not getting downvoted for ideology, you are getting downvoted because you sound insane and it worries me that there's people like you out there. You sound like one of those people that would go on a killing spree because "God told me to"	24
0	Having it be cut at all. See the verses in the description.	24
0	It's incredibly disturbing. I try to understand what must be going through some peoples mind when they say such horrible things, and I can't figure out how their brain must work that they have such a twisted line of thinking	24
0	Excuse me?  If you did not want to have a discussion on the subject, then why did you post the video and why are you talking to me?  Did you simply want an excuse to speak in a condescending manner if I dared to disagree with you?	24
0	May I ask what you base that from? 1 Corinthians 11:14 states: Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?  This certainly sounds like it's beyond a specific church.	24
0	How do you definitively know that's what shaved means? I based the definition according to the King James Bible dictionary; a source I assumed was reliable.  http://av1611.com/kjbp/kjv-dictionary/shave.html   EDIT: Also, if shaved and cut off mean the same thing.. why are they both used in the same verse?	24
0	I've got a busy day and I'm afraid that would take research I don't have the time to do	24
0	This is a propaganda sub to promote left wing views to Christians, sad it turned out this way.	24
0	So if an infant dies of natural causes, it's murder?	24
0	Well, I honestly do not know when the first drawing of Jesus with long hair that has become the mainstream image of him, but I think most Christians agree that it is not an accurate portrayal of Jesus.	24
0	Personally, I felt that Penn Jillette made some good points, but I honestly want to see R/Christianity's opinions on and possible refutations to anything they disagreed with.   (Does not have to neccesarily be Christians responding).	24
0	Do not hate please. Life is only so long and I just luff u	24
0	So much of Christianity depends on a supernatural element that you can not separate it. If you endorse it as a life philosophy you can't honestly disassociate the two when they are that tightly bound. You endorse a dependence on magic by association.	24
0	I think it was Sir Francis Bacon who said something along the lines of (I'm paraphrasing), "...a dog is just a dog, but man inspires the dog to become more. The dog learns to fetch, do tricks, and become somewhat civil. Likewise, is the relationship between God and man. A belief in a higher power gives man an infinitely powerful mark to aim for. And allows him to become more than a man..."	24
0	Both of those are true, they are with God now, but that doesn't lessen the sin of their murder. I don't know why the victims being saved to a better situation in your mind translates to the perpetrator doing nothing wrong. God making an exception in this one case doesn't make just any murder we want to think of an exception.	24
0	I think it means that positive arguments should have been made against the institution when it was in question.  I happen to agree with them.	24
0	That's kinda creepy tbh	24
0	What exactly are you having trouble understanding?	24
0	Same secular crowd defends abortion so its 1 for 1.	24
0	In Roman Catholicism, these catechisms are literally infallible conclusions derived from the Word of God and taught as absolute truth. They are debated over and discussed by the entire papal authority and declared devine truths by the pope. Now if you're not Catholic, this is just another interpretation. But if you are Catholic, you believe in the infallibility of the pope and therefore that the catechisms are just as true as the resurrection of Jesus.	24
0	Glad you found it interesting.   That line from Corinthians resonated with me when I decided that faith wasn't for me. I felt like someone writing or translating the bible had inserted it as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the bible being useful for social control but fundamentally unseemly for an educated adult to believe.	24
0	If you're honestly feeling like you shouldn't marry someone who you work well with for religious reasons alone, its time to asses what went wrong with your understanding of religion.	24
0	Just thought it could be helpful. Have a great week!	24
0	There is no hell or eternal torture and punishment in Judaism.	24
0	Yeah. But the difference is that polytheistic religions who say their gods do terrible things form time to time usually don't pretend that this overlaps with being all good somehow.	24
0	If you think that even if a situation is good that religion would prescribe you to abandon it, then it means you think that religion can and should make arbitrary demands for no reason from time to time. If the situation is not all good, then asking strangers won't help you when they don't know the people inolved. You have to find this out on your own.	24
0	I believe that God is a God of love, and that everything he does can be traced back to his love. If there exists a Bible passage which seems to contradict this truth, I know that it's being interpreted incorrectly. I don't just go "Ah, whatever" and say that God allowed a sinful man to taint his holy collection of books. To do so would put the entire validity of the Scripture into question. I try to learn why these things happened, and my faith grows every second I do so.	24
0	&gt;  inane gibberish  Do you know what these words mean?	24
0	I am sorry there was a typeo in my earlier statement   Orthodox Judaism should say Orthodox Christianity	24
0	I'll never try and make God's actions through his word fit in with a quote from some unrelated guy The Lord created lol.	24
0	It's sad that we have to be given all that information, but thanks for sharing it.	24
0	I can't know for sure how true this all is, but I'm hoping that things work out well according to God's plan for those who have been cheated. Does that count for anything?	24
0	Well that's not what I meant even a little, and I've clarified now about four times. I'm getting pretty sick of it. If you'd like to peruse the replies to my comment, I've pointed out several times the huge difference between God specifically ordaining an exception to the murder rule and saying murder is just okay because lulz. I'm not engaging this anymore if people aren't going to read the whole conversation.	24
0	Resist the urge, OP. You can have better discussions, if you search for people, who aren't rude, and who engage your questions.  Those, who agree with you might only help to create that echo chamber.	24
0	Way to take one point of a law that Christians don't even follow and grossly mischaracterize it. Tell me the one about the shellfish or mixed fibers next!	24
0	It's not  being a psychopath.  It's a cultural thing.  Were all the people of prior cultures that did these things psychopaths?  Certainly not.  It was just an accepted practice.  I don't think things matter if God's not there.  I mean, any meaning is just imaginary, then.  Nothing lasts and will be forgotten.  Everything ends up like it never was, so it doesn't matter.  No reason to care about anything.  I think most of what we care about is cultural.	24
0	Okay. You can choose to believe that, certainly.	24
0	Like some others have, I also suggest going to a Christian retreat camp, being away from all the technology really helps you to see and discover God on your own. Stay strong.	24
0	Hey, no problem whatsoever! Write only if you want to, when you want to, and however much you want to :)  Odds are we'll probably not come to any kind of big agreement, but that's not too big a problem. I see it more like a fun exercise in philosophy really :)	24
0	i think the idea of helping the poor is mentioned over two thousand times in the bible.  It's pretty radical political philosophy in all honestly:)	24
0	Sex.... IS marriage in the eyes of God. It's when you are no longer having sex with that person it becomes a little dicey, since "divorce" IS a sin.	24
0	Mmmmmm, no, most marriages in Christ's time were largely contractual things. The woman was given to a man for the purposes of the two families being brought together for largely economic benefit on the part of the woman's father.	24
0	lolwhut.   You realize that you can physically have sex with zero emotional attachment, right? Or do you think the guy that has sex every weekend with whoever at a party is married to dozens of women?	24
0	We need a "What Does the Bible Really Say About Marriage" book.  [*What Does the Bible Really Say About Homosexuality* on Amazon](http://amzn.com/1433549379)	24
0	&gt; Sex.... IS marriage in the eyes of God.  So you renege your original argument. Let me move on to the second presumption...  &gt;It's when you are no longer having sex with that person it becomes a little dicey, since "divorce" IS a sin.  Because sex is the only reason marriage happens, right? These people can't *possibly* love one another. Nah, sex is the only reason.	24
0	Aww. I didn't know you felt that way! It's actually kinda cute for someone so scripturally (is that a word?) intense to feel like that. I've got great resources on the science behind same sex attraction if youre interested	24
0	Atheism- We're probably right.	24
0	Of course we could be wrong, but then again so could everyone else.  Probability is the way to go.	24
0	Absolute certainity is over-rated.  We can only really have it about a few logical absolutes.  For everything else we have to go with the most probable answer.	24
0	I mean....you mix communists with near-Catholics, I'm sure there's a lot we wouldn't like!	24
0	Despite all the other attempts below, the real answer is: no. No one can explain it to you on a simple level. The best way I heard it put back when I was anglo-catholic was that the only reason Anglicanism as a thing hasn't collapsed entitely is that it is so screwed up and complicated no one actually understands the situation. Which pretty much matched my experiences on the ground. Everything has splintered a million different ways for a million different reasons and nobody has a good picture of what or why or who.	24
0	Progressive? In what way?	24
0	Cuz He's God whether you like it or not.	24
0	To sum it up as briefly as possible: after hearing the arguments for the existence of gods, I find it more probable that they do not exist.  It seems much more likely that all the gods are products of man's early attempts to understand the world around him.  If a god does exist, it has not been demonstrated by any of the arguments I have encountered.	24
0	I believe most of us here are followers of Jesus and the teachings of the New Testament, so I think you're safe in regards to that passage.	24
0	That's a nuanced point.  You have a fantastic week as well.  I'm out for the night.	24
0	Paul was also a sexist and ripped Mary Magdalena's book out. Apparently it's with the Dead Sea Scrolls and paints a much different light on many things. The best way to view it is just to live your life helping people. Don't down people. Don't treat others poorly. Do a decent job trying to better yourself and better the lives of those around you.	24
0	Mormon: the one everyone hates, but the truth everyone needs.	24
0	Lol I went to your most recent comment and posted the same conceited and rude reply that you did, within the same situation. Not exactly stalking, but call it what you want to.	24
0	He recognized the sexist culture. That's not the same.	24
0	Her account of Jesus's life. Look up the Dead Sea Scrolls. They're hidden from us, taken to the Vatican basements.	24
0	No, it's not, and this will now be the seventh time I've explained it to someone. Read the other replies or don't waste my time and yours.	24
0	Just so it's clear, casual sex is not always the same as premarital sex. In theory one could only have sex with one person without ever having some formal declaration of marriage.	24
0	In my experience, if people didn't think their beliefs were right, they probably wouldn't be practicing them. By practicing those beliefs, there's the inherent thinking that they're correct in it.	24
0	Still, you generally think yours is 'more' right then others. I never really understood that "Everyone is equally right!" Philosophy. Some religions contradict each other, actually most do.	24
0	Um, there's one right answer found n the Bible. anything else is false teaching.	24
0	Grow some balls and ask her out.	24
0	**My reasoning was never that killing the infant was good for the infant.** The whole conversation is on record, go ahead and check, I made one comment that they were happy in heaven and never once said that that in any way justified their death or was good for them. Has everyone in this thread gone mental?  I never claimed that heaven made it okay for children to die. I suppose when someone's grandma dies I'm not allowed to say "well at least her pain is over" without everyone jumping all over me for "implying" that she should have been euthanized.	24
0	Holy fucking shit. This website is off its fucking nut tonight.	24
0	The bible. It's missing several accounts apparently. I almost went into religious studies, but I don't like being screamed at by people who don't even bother to examine other religions and the similarities. I'm catholic, but the world has a lot of good teachings and a lot of corruption had happened. Just like the missing books.	24
0	No, it isn't, no one has given even a half decent explanation for that that. I just listed a bunch of reasons why it doesn't work none of which you bothered with, in fact no one seems to bother with any of my actual reasons they just keep repeating that it's better to kill them before they can screw the pooch as if I'd never said anything at all.  I'll be sure to never mention children in heaven again. Learned my lesson.	24
0	But I didn't say whether it was good or not. I said not to trust strangers as an exhaustive source who aren't really given meaningful information who will then respond with blanket responses that may not correspond well to the particular situation.	24
0	Probably the atheists. But that's a different discussion. I was trying to be helpful here.	24
0	I agree with you on why it is unsatisfactory. As a Christian I cannot accept that.  For myself, my response would be to point to the nephilim. They were the offspring of fallen angels/demons and humanity (think Goliath). We are already told that nephilim were in this area after the exodus, and I view this command to be a purging of sorts to make sure the demonic bloodline doesn't continue/spread. Just my two cents though.	24

0	None of the conversation you two are about to have does anyting to justify killing babies for any reason every. Doesn't matter who's culture was "better". How can you not see this?  What am I reading?	24
0	Can't this be used to justify murder?	24
0	This sub is such propaganda. It's all become  "Christians" complaining about Christianty and trying to inject left wing views into it.	24
0	You are the only person ever that I've seen that has magickal stuff as well. I wonder, do you believe that the same God guides those objects as the one that appears in the Bible? I use tarot cards myself but I firmly believe its another way of praying to Christ, not an extra-christian pagan worship as most Catholics believe. Thanks.	24
0	How can you be so sure of the reported experience of a man who lived centuries before you?	24
0	Ned Flanders is your man.  Seriously though, water baptism is not even necessary, the real baptism is done by God through the holy spirit. Not saying to not get water baptism, just saying it is not a requirement for salvation. It is a nice ceremony, and I have been dunked by my pastor in the local creek.	24
0	to follow that to the logical conclusion, then it is morally just to kill children before they age where they are no longer "innocent" to keep them from going to hell, even at the risk of going there yourself.  If you would risk your life to save a child, would you not risk your soul to save 10-20-30 souls from eternal torture?  Since christianity has always been big on self sacrifice what could be more self sacrificing than offering up your own soul to save many others?	24
0	That I want to love God with all my heart and be obedient to my Lord?   Why do you feel the need to downvote?  All I've done so far is dispassionately explain my reasoning on the topic, and answer the hypotheticals and questions of others to try to foster a good discussion.	24
0	I didn't appreciate being brainwashed by the concept of heaven/hell at a time when I still believed in Santa Claus.	24

0	Ugh. Another Penal Substitutionary Atonement thread.	24
0	Jeremiah 19:9 made me a vegetarian	24
0	That was my point? We obviously have a long large body of moral philosophy in existence which we know give a more firm basis for ethics than just clinging to something without knowing or caring whether its standards are reasonable. And standards which handwave it away basically lead down the same path as arbitrarily being able to handwave away literally everything. Which is why creationism exists. They are using the same logic for other things that they use for morality.	24
0	Homosexuality comes from a variety of sources, ranging from child abuse to genetic disease to poor moral character to what your friend said. There's no single factor that brings it about.  Also, both Testaments strongly condemn homosexuality. Anyone who says otherwise is repeating a lie they heard or outright lying themselves.	24
0	It's very tough, but humans can be incredibly violent towards each other.  The Egyptians ordered all male Jewish babies killed at birth among other acts. God gave the Pharaoh 10 chances to let them go. It's unfortunate for those Egyptian babies, but that is what it took.   Or would you have God not sent the 10th plague, and the Egyptians continue killing all Jewish male babies as they had done for decades?	24
0	Actually, there is.  Deuteronomy 3:11 MSG  "Og king of Bashan was the last remaining Rephaite. His bed, made of iron, was over thirteen feet long and six wide. You can still see it on display in Rabbah of the People of Ammon."  Rephaite = Nephilim  His kingdom was founded by Nephilim. His dynasty, his people were "demon babies".  Just going by the text here.	24
0	Have you seen a miracle with your own eyes? Do you trust the words of some man 2000 years ago, over your own eyes?	24
0	Hundreds? Did all of these hundreds of people write their experiances down? In addition what prophecies have come true?	24
0	Why not?   attraction to the same sex is visible in the brain.Sexuality is governed by the brain so anything outside the norm could be considered disordered.	24
0	The bible is rather simple reading.  It's not that complex, God gave the Holy Spirit after Jesus to lead us into truth.	24
0	As long as you define worship so narrowly that nothing in modern society would qualify, then sure.	24
0	The church was founded then not your denomination.	24
0	&gt;keep up the **hard** work	24
0	Ha Mashiach Nagid came for the lost sheep of Israel.  Understandably you have some cultural issues influencing your views.   Ask God to reveal to you His truth, I think he is drawing you to him.	24
0	I think declaring any topic a dead horse topic is a bad idea, as it only starts motivating people to call for censorship.  &gt;Seems like every week there's a post along the lines of "American state idol worship" or "US military idol worship".  Nothing wrong with that. Anyone can choose to ignore that or any other topic if they wish.	24
0	First of all, let me encourage you to keep asking questions and to break away from the shackles you have been in.  Start by getting a different translation of the Bible and using it exclusively for a while, the NRSV might be a good choice.  Also do some reading about church and biblical history. You may find that a more "Contemporary" mindset isn't the best fit but rather a more historic and ancient one. But you can explore that once you've done some legwork.  BTW, our pastors never wear a suit and tie. During worship they wear vestments, outside of worship either regular clothes of a dress shirt.	24
0	So here's the question: you seem very confident that the Biblical authors were wrong about the character of God, but you have it right - what are you basing your judgement on?	24
0	Maybe just not present it at all? The child will eventually learn about religion on their own, and will be able to come to a decision on their own without any parental bias.	24
0	I wish I could up vote this to the top.	24
0	Yes, we have an even stronger word used in Deuteronomy for joy, *yasis*, when it says that God will "take delight over you to cause you to perish and to destroy you."  Again, we need to understand the perceptive will and decretive will of God in order to make sense of what's going on here.	24
0	Did you read the article?	24
0	They have? How?	24
0	so can "you kids are driving me crazy! i'm going to leave and never come back!"	24
0	I would think that if God's intention was to remove the fallen state of reality from the world, he wouldn't have bothered saving species or humanity. I believe that the flood was to punish mankind, but not eradicate it. The reason we are still fallen is because the people that God saved were still sinful - honoring God, but just as broken as you or I are.	24
0	"but test everything; hold fast what is good." 1 Thess 5:21  Always challenge every notion like that against Scripture. If it's not in there, can it. Adding to Scripture is as much a sin as throwing some out.   For instance, IIRC there are 4 references in the NT about dress, and everyone of them promotes modesty and not being flashy. Putting on your best expensive suit for church is the opposite of what the Bible teaches.	24
0	&gt;If you believe all ethics has to be supported by reason or rationality, why not just skip the middle man and be an atheist.  1) That is not how atheism works.    2) Furthermore, you assume a belief in God based on an emotional prospect.	24
0	are spiritual needs not equivalent to physical needs?	24
0	Just curious. I know there isn't much of a connection, but it has some motifs related to Christianity, kinda just wanna see what everyone thinks or gets from it.  iunno	24
0	&gt; In a perfect world, yes, but that's not what happens  But that's exactly what happens. People don't read or reply to topics they're not interested in or tired of.  &gt;Instead it just causes the same arguments every week and nothing ever changes.  Because people aren't tired of discussing those topics yet.  Look at the gay wedding cake topic. For a while we had two or three a day. Now its been days since the subject has come up (actually miss having at least one). And this happened without dead horse censoring.	24
0	That doesn't explain why God does things that are sins for humans to do	24
0	You could say that about any western nation as well. Christians are increasingly becoming persecuted around the entire world.	24
0	No, The answer would only depend on what's in the bible, the rest would be false teachings.	24
0	Other translations often change, omit, or have notes that cast doubt on verses that were in the Bible for most of history and are considered to be important for doctrine. Acts 8:37, which is important support for believer's baptism, is an example.	24
0	...Before I click...is...is it *love* love?	24
0	WE MEET AGAIN. And yet, the IRS, and official arm of the Federal Government, can target christian groups.  Or how about you fire the teacher leading the CHRISTIAN after school group for praying? The persecution is laid apparent if you just look.	24
0	They probably mostly have love for sticking it to the man	24
0	So you don't think its happening?	24
0	God can saved babies by His grace, but they are sinners and God is not obliged to save them.	24
0	Romans 11 says the pleroma of Gentiles and pleroma of Jews will be ultimately reconciled, even if it takes Romans 2 wrath for some. Pleroma means absolute fullness in overwhelming excess, even such that it was used as an idiom for patched clothing.  * Love is the pleroma of the Law.  * The Earth is God's, and the pleroma in it.  * Christ is the pleroma of the Deity bodily.	24
0	Well, ignorance is preferable to heresy.      I'm not sure what they actually believe due to the vomit-worthy bias from the journalist, but I saw nothing contrary to the usual 'LGBT rights' lines claiming this is discrimination.  That said, there is no reason to disagree with the Church on this issue, only the blind sentimentality from which most evil comes.	24
0	Of course, compared to the middle east.	24
0	FYI: Jesus was a socialist.   He and the disciples lived communisticly as well.	24
0	He knows that what has convinced many others has failed to convict you of the same conclusion. If you're open to God showing up in your life in His timing, He'll do it. If not, then your walls are ever before Him.	24
0	Apparently it's the kids too. My friends son says his speech and debate team might add will be the gsa too.	24
0	I only know a couple other debaters who are gay, but my best guess would be about 1 in 3 coaches/administrators is gay. That may vary between high school and college though, I haven't seen any public high school forensic teams before.	24
0	Ya know, at first when I read this I was terrified for your child, family and yourself.  Then I read it again, and it seemed...off.    I checked your comment history, and to say that this is really, really a terrible thing to do is just an understatement.  It devalues the people who have serious mental illnesses and parents who are suffering from post-partum depression/psychosis and do harm their children.   I have reported you to the mods for this flagrant attempt to not only contribute nothing to the conversation, but actively derail it an attempt to create upvotes in /r/exchristian.	24
0	&gt;You keep bringing up censorship  Because when topics get declared dead horse the next thing that happens is that some one tries to get them banned for a week/month/forever.  &gt;  I merely expressing my frustration with a topic that I feel has been beaten into the ground on this sub.  I understand that, just as some are frustrated with gay wedding cake threads. I personally don't care for the "does [insert name or group] go to Heaven (or hell).   But the solution is for all of us to participate in the topics we like and ignore those we don't.	24
0	I get it. But it's still sad that some women will take any opportunity, even if under the guise of activism to objectify themselves	24
0	Am I a bad person for imagining the Hindu nationalists to be a lot like the Baalists in the Old Testament?   There's something mystically sinister and creepy about them.	24
0	Everything you think is wrong. That's anti-Catholic mythology, not Catholic teaching.	24
0	From a purely musical standpoint, I like Yelawolf's part, but Eminem is awful and this song is no exception.  I couldn't even finish it, I stopped the song shortly after Eminem came in.  I want to discuss the religious themes in this song, but it's so cliched that I don't think it really deserves to be treated as though it has a serious point.  We get it, you're a gangster but you still love Jesus, that's nice, literally no rappers have ever talked about that before.	24
0	A good metric would be that things should be preached about in proportion to what tangible benefit can be derived from people following the precepts. I would hope most people trying to be realistic would place things that can save lives above whether someone masturbates.	24
0	It would be easy for a Sikh to indicate they're not Muslim if questioned whereas the persecution of Christians is happening on a legal level in the West. Sikhs are barely mentioned in the media, negatively or positively, whereas Christian religious freedom is constantly under the glaring and judging eye of liberals. Obama seems to be perfectly content with this state of affairs and even made jokes about the Christian businesses in Indiana being targeted in his recent dinner address. Losing your business and livelihood and having your beliefs dragged through the mud in the media is apparently funny to him.	24
0	In the 50s. I think *for a reason*...	24
0	Sure, B. B. King is a legend, but do we really need a post to commemorate every great person nearing the end of their life?	24
0	&gt; thinking that someone involved in a gay civil ceremony shouldn't be fired from a Catholic school heresy?      The subset we're talking about knows and disagrees with the Catechism on an important issue.  Disagreeing with the Church on a matter of faith and morals by the baptized is exactly what heresy means.  They might disagree with the school policy for teachers not publicly living in sin without being heretical, but that isn't what you brought up.      Also, gayness has nothing to do with it.  This is about sexual deviancy that doesn't even rise to the level of fornication regardless of what anyone feels inclined to do.	24
0	It's an evil ideology, sinister, subversive, cloaked in mysticism, with false prophets and idol worship...   If the shoe fits.	24
0	Hand them a Lee Strobel book, of course.	24
0	So maybe it'd be fair to say that you see the character of God inconsistent between, say, Samuel and Luke?	24
0	I had an issue with God telling people to kill babies.  This isn't a sin of omission like you're talking about.  This is ordering something that I could never see as being moral.	24
0	Don't dress in a way that cause your brothers (or sisters) to stumble.  &gt;But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.	24
0	You don't know what Papal infallibility means. Don't link to a page that refutes your own claim in order to push it.	24
0	Following the word of man instead of the Word of God is one of the reasons the Jews didn't recognize Jesus as the Messiah when he came. They let tradition influence them instead of learning from the scriptures.  It's prophetic of our day and gives us insight on how to avoid making the same mistake.	24
0	Honestly don't see how you can come to that conclusion. Guess we'll have to agree to disagree.	24
0	\&gt;8 minute video  \&gt;dismisses conclusions within 6 minutes of the video being posted  ?	24
0	I don't think you did, since he doesn't have any judgmental conclusions in the end.	24
0	Exactly what verses are you referring to here? We must be careful of tradition.  [Matthew 15:2-3 KJV]   [Mark 7:8 KJV] &lt;-- **the Sabbath**, for one   [Mark 7:13 KJV]   [Col 2:8 KJV]   [2 Thessalonians 3:6 KJV]   [John 17:17 KJV]    The Bible is the Word of God. God's Word is truth. Tradition's of men change, but God stays the same. We must root ourselves in scripture.	24
0	Of course, that defends on your definition of a god.	24
0	No. This is ridiculous. The metaphor simply doesn't apply. A discussion about whether it's possible to prove a subjective property of something we all agree exists has no significant similarities with a discussion about proving whether something exists.  Your instruction to look at this example metaphorically doesn't change that.	24
0	He was an important figure in the creation of the new testament with his advocacy of Paul and his message of Christ's universality. His excommunication is just one of the unfortunate tragedies perpetrated by the early church fathers.	24
0	Ok, can you please elaborate on how you *know* certain metaphysical truths about the universe such as all infants 'go to be with the Father'? I'm pretty sure knowing something directly contradicts the notion of 'faith.'	24
0	This is either a total screw-up on the part of the school system or the article is junk.  It says that the school system declared rosaries as being gang related after consulting a priest????? What priest would say something that stupid?	24
0	We actually prayed for a guy before the sermon yesterday. He's being deployed.   Literally gubberment indoctrination	24
0	&gt;  Its practically safer not to associate oneself with a gang, even accidentally. Still  A rosary is in no way shape or form associating oneself with a gang.  Are the students going to be required to go naked because gang members wear clothes?	24
0	I'm not attempting to downplay the suffering of anybody. We're just having a discussion regarding the persecution of Christians worldwide and my point is that it is also pervasive in the West, albeit within the context of freedoms and not in a life or death scenario as faced by Christians in many other countries in the East. By that standard, I feel America is becoming more and more anti-Christian and I believe Obama is responsible for not addressing this and in some cases instigating it.	24
0	Now you're changing the analogy.	24
0	You read. A lot. Of non-fiction.  And then you come together and reason. I did not come into this world, but rather I came out of it. Alan Watts liked to say "Like the apple tree apples, it seems this universe we live in, at the very least, peoples." That, I think, is not coincidence, nor accident. I'm entitled to my thoughts just as much as you are. :) I didn't mean to come off rash.	24
0	I only ask (anybody, not just you) to be willing to do the hard thing, in any area of your life, and think "Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about." And then never stop questioning what it is your eyes see or your ears hear or your thoughts think.  We all know there are a lot of dumb people being paid ludicrous amounts of money to keep us from thinking, especially that very thought. That's all.	24
0	I would have referred to your denomination's reverence for the psalms and other OT scripture (the Prophets), but I wish I could agree with you. Unfortunately, the earliest evidence points to the rejection of Paul and the other Apostles by leadership in some churches, and clearly the prophetic order referred to in the Didache is gone.  To me it's no surprise that the "pillar" is divided, i.e. fallen.	24
0	Because this is /r/Christianity, not /r/inmemoriam. It's not the purpose of the subreddit. And there's too many good people to recognize all of them.	24

0	Superintelligent researchers who have never read basic theology, which would have answered there question. A few minutes research would have found them this:- https://carm.org/what-is-free-will If they want something more intence there is:- https://winteryknight.wordpress.com/?s=freewill	24
0	Depends on how far south, near the mexico border is Catholic country and gets mixed further north you go. Some people in central Texas have never seen a Catholic let alone know what one is. As a cradle Catholic in south Texas, I never really knew what a protestant was. University was a wake up for both protestants and Catholics. I saw many conversions both ways. Protestants seemed to be really on fire for Catholicism and had radical conversions.  Catholics seemed bored and tried out church after church looking for something more exciting (...than the real presence of God).	24
0	Most of the popular ideas about Satan are made up and not based on Biblical information.  I did an exhaustive study on the material and [wrote a blog series on the topic](http://fatherlearningtolove.blogspot.com/2014/04/satan-lifting-veil-part-1-introduction.html).  It's actually quite fascinating material once you start playing detective with it.	24
0	&gt; The service is all about the sermon, and the church is all about him. That's why some of these never survive a pastor change.  Yes, the sermon in Protestant churches has taken the place of the sacraments in Orthodox churches. But it can be argued that both the sermon, and the sacraments have been 'golden calves' in the churches.	24
0	I encourage you to read the article. I too thought it was secularized but what they are doing here is disturbing.	24
0	Didn't Jesus dress as those in the surrounding culture dressed?  I'm more inclined in that direction.  Not knocking that this system in its symbology isn't interesting, but not what I want from my religious leaders.  I want them to stand out not because of what they wear, but how they are leading the way.  If I walk into a room, I don't want to know which man or woman is clergy just by looking around at their attire, I'd much rather learn it by how they conduct themselves.	24
0	&gt;Ok I'm done. There's nothing short of a supernatural vision that can convince me   So you are impervious to reason?	24
0	I also encourage you to read the article. In this case, it is sinister!	24
0	I understand it makes some people uncomfortable, and I would never make it seem like real money.  I usually ask people, "Did you get your million?" or something similar.  Sometimes they think it is a political statement.  &amp;nbsp;  It's actually a reference to the "million dollar question"	24
0	Yet another reason note to vote for the green party.	24
0	In the priesthood of all the saint sense - yes - but that would be under the assumption all in the room were Christ followers.	24
0	&gt; I don't think wearing clothes that distinguish one's job really means that they're the only ones to approach God.  Of coarse not. But even Jesus said beware of those(Scribes) who wear long robes and make a show. The fancy garments(like the ones in the picture and the ones the Pope wears) of coarse cannot tell what is in the heart but they do imply Spiritual importance and authority.	24
0	&gt;Just more slippery slope scaremongering  Back in '73 all the liberals were saying that no woman actually wants an abortion and all the backwards conservatives were just fear mongering us into a ban on the woman's "right to choose." Yet here we are, 57 million dead fetuses later.	24
0	&gt; I mean, he's trying to encourage greater conversation towards the issue, but I don't think its fair to look at everything going on in Baltimore, the desperate plea of a marginalized corner of society against continual injustice and say, "eh, they need fathers".  This is an unfair (and incorrect) characterization of what he's saying. On the far left you have people who support those who would riot and on the far right you have people who support cracking down hard. But this priest is trying to look at the human issues, what is really missing from everyday life for these protestors.	24
0	If you leave without dealing with iur ego driven red tape tou arnt just awit ch ing churches you are abandoning the Gospel.   This is so perverse itdoesnt even upset me. Its hilarious.	24
0	&gt; They are priestly garb which shows their role in the church and their service to both God and their fellow man.  They need a garb to remind them of their role in the church? Or is it so when newcomers come for the first time they can say, "Hey look!, That man is important. We better listen to what he has to say. He is the one with all the spiritual authority."	24
0	Begging the question by presuming that marriage is justified solely by consent.	24
0	I'm not sure things are that far off, though, in a lot of places. I suppose it's lucky that Islam doesn't put as much emphasis on proselytization.	24
0	Well, the article addresses this, in fact.	24
0	The way the pastor said it is kind of dickish but it never ceases to amaze me how much of an emotional backlash someone like him can generate. I would've just moved on with my life personally.  In fact, I find it hard to believe they cared about the pastor or what he said; I suspect they just used him as excuse to be lewd and to be anti-religion (see the church comment) under the disguise of a noble cause (which made me chuckle especially when they said they were saving lives LOL).	24

0	It's actually not.	24
0	What is [Ephesians 5:25-28]?	24
0	So you ignore the fact that God gave warning with the previous 9 plagues.  And you would prefer God do nothing right and leave the Jews to be killed.	24
0	He's referring to fathers of the rioters. I hope none of the rioters are fathers, using violence a terrible example for their children if so.	24
0	Did you really create your account just to rampage about circumcision?	24

0	For starters, there's a limit to two persons, which was the entire point of this thread.	24
0	If /u/slagnanz is saying that then I disagree. Such a statement would effectively nullify the words of anyone who hadn't experienced something personally, including Jesus, no?	24
0	&gt; the focal point should be the Eucharist and not a sermon or pastor.  I thought the focal point should be on making the world a better place through acts of love and service. The Eucharist is noble but by no means should it be the central theme of a Christians acts of service.	24
0	Cmon, that language isn't very Christlike. I think Jeebus would be mad at how you are responding.	24
0	You said that consent is all that is needed for a legal marriage. Are you going to acknowledge that you were wrong or just keep shifting the goal posts of your argument?	24
0	&gt;  toeing the line  Yep, that's the way I roll.	24
0	&gt;Father Tom here sides clearly   He isn't siding with riots or police brutality. Importance on the family transcends political labels, as does religion. I think it's unfair you keep trying to pigeonhole people as "for those with *the* message" (even though all people have views they are trying to get across) or "against *the* message", whichever one it is you prefer. I also get the feeling you didn't watch the video, as you make a lot of assumptions about what Father Tom said that he clearly didn't say.	24
0	Depends what topic your looking for exactly	24
0	Isn't that wrong though? This is why we must hold onto the traditions of the apostles and Church Fathers. Because of this factor. Because if we leave interpretation up to each man and not to the Church, we end up with chaos.	24
0	So phenomenally terrible you just can't even say what's wrong with it? I would say the more terrible it is, the easier that would be.  So he should hate his wife? Be mad at her? What's your suggestion? We should feel sorry for him? I feel sorry for HER. She's obviously lost.	24
0	Well that's okay sweetheart I appreciate the thought.	24
0	The Anglican Communion is a church among many. So no, it would be considered a church.	24
0	Did the apostles all hold to the same christologies because I thought there were councils to discuss the different natures of God. If the "Didache" was written by apostles's disciples than why were there so many different views as opposed to one unified idea from the Didache?	24
0	Are they united in teaching? Or do they differ?	24
0	Because it became harder and harder to kill off those who strayed into heresy.	24
0	In regards to Lutheranism perhaps you could answer this: Why do you believe in the Lutheran church? There was an unbroken apostolic lineage for approx 1500 years in regards to teaching, doctrine, liturgical styles, dogmas and Holy Tradition. Why do you believe the Lutheran Confessions are correct?	24
0	&gt; definitely make sure every participant is consenting adult with no fear or inequality in their relationship  Is that even possible?	24
0	We must love through and in Truth. If the Truth can be manipulated then so can love. We can understand God now because he has come as the Son of God incarnate, the Living and Eternal Word. Because he has deified his body for us we can listen, understand, walk with, suffer with, etc with Him. He understood that even God can be misunderstood which is why he had 12 disciples. Those disciples eventually evangelized. Going back to my original question: What did they teach, what did their students and those who heard their words teach and so on?	24
0	As a single church yes and closer to Orthodoxy and Catholicism than the rest of Protestantism for holding onto bits and parts of tradition but I fear Anglicanism has shifted into mainstream Protestantism. I'm even beginning to believe that Anglican sacraments may not be sacraments anymore because they have changed the meaning of holy orders. Do not take this into offense. Cardinal John Henry Newman and G.K Chesterton understood that Anglicanism could not survive the tides of history.	24
0	Indeed but we have to go back to what the apostles, their successors thought of the Church - not only in terms of teaching but in terms of Church hierarchy concerning Holy Orders.	24
0	My question goes back again. Did the apostles, the Church Fathers their successors believe in the Book of Concord?	24
0	Of course we can be right. If we can't be right then we cannot love right. Their is absolute Truth not only in Christ but in His Church. He did not intent for their to be 20,000+ denominations but One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church that held onto united teaching, doctrine, worship and faith.	24
0	I was talking about supremacy. Infallability is moreso when the Church convenes and agrees on doctrine or dogma - the Bishop of Rome can use this infallability to make it such.	24
0	I think because the Jews said he did, honestly.	24
0	Sin. Because of our weakness we have neither the will nor the strength to unite. Remember that Pope Francis (St Peter) and Patriarch Bartholomew (St Andrew). The past half century has shown a greater initiative in uniting the churches. If we can unite the Catholic and Orthodox churches then the gates of hell will surely never prevail.	24
0	Then why are the teachings of Lutherans (a 500 year old church) different than the teachings of the Orthodox Church (a 2000 year old church)	24
0	Or the Reformation is a heresy and Protestants though part of the Church are just lost in a sense.	24
0	I know this may make me sound silly, but I learned about things like binatarianism and different councils that discussed different theologies. I also learned about an evolutionary pattern from the earliest gospel which isn't Matthew but Mark lol.   Why was there so much controversy or different views if the apostles taught the same idea? Why wasn't there some ultimate authority such as the "Diadche" to maintain uniformity.  Of course sweetheart I don't want you to do my paper, but can you outline like the main different views and which apostle each of the views can be traced back to, just an outline. Thanks!	24
0	The Anglican Church has lost thousands of followers in recent decades many of whom have become Orthodox and Catholic. All they did was read history .. literally. Metropolitan Tikhon and Kallistos Ware are two awesome examples.	24
0	I dont know it just seems like there is a greater emphasis on observing and participating in rituals, chants and prayers than on living out the life of Christ by putting effort into making the world a better place?  It is as if we have made the Sacraments idols in that they have taken central president over everything else.	24
0	Not the best way. The right way. We can serve God in many different ways. We each have our own way of getting to know the Lord but the Church must be infallible in teaching.	24
0	Without love in Truthful teaching we don't even have a cymbal. My point is that that without the fulness of the Church in Truth we can make Christ and His teaching to be whatever we want it to be instead of what it should be.	24
0	I disagree. The Church, which I'll asume means any organized Christian denomination(correct me if I'm wrong), has fucked up a lot. I feel that if God is real, then he wouldn't like religions being essentially poltical bodies.	24
0	I think they both go back to the idea that women are objects for consumption.	24
0	We're not putting God in a box. We're letting God put us in a box, not in boxes. One Church united in faith and teaching.	24
0	Salvation is a lifelong progress. True salvation is not so much about what God can do for you (although that is part of it), but what you can do for God (in the form of putting your faith in action and loving others).  By self suffering I mean becoming a mature Christian, no more dependant on your priest or pastor for growth.	24
0	Sure but who are they? They switch for emotional reasons not because it is the true Church. I was a former Protestant once. The best Protestants become Orthodox/Catholic. We have a track record. I'm not making this a game of who has more converts. I'm trying to unite the churches so that we can become the Church Christ intended - one united teaching and faith not thousands of them.	24
0	They have the freedom to do so but they do so with the free will God granted them. Do this do this out of ignorance? I don't know but we have to encounter and face this. Protestants are great Christians truly they've contributed much to Christianity but it's time we bring them into the fold and unite the Church as it once was.	24
0	Friend,   All I'm asking is that you read history - go back 500 years ago and then 1900 years ago and see what happened. You don't need to talk to me. I'm trying to bring us all into one fold. I want us to all pray and worship together under sound teaching and faith. That's all.	24
0	&gt;Desperation.  There are many videos on youtube of feminists getting abortions and commenting on how liberating it feels to get the "parasite" scraped out of them. Some of them intentionally got pregnant just so they could get an abortion.	24
0	You're using Catholic sources.     Texas - 2012 - 173,935 deaths.    Just the Albigensian Crusade  (1209) by itself is estimated by real scholars at 1,000,000.  There were sieges of towns like Bezier where they killed off everyone, Catholics and Cathars, "and let God sort them out," where 20,000 people died.    This continued through 1245.  Convert or burn was the strategy.  They exhumed corpses to burn them.	24
0	[link](http://www.reactionface.info/sites/default/files/imagecache/Node_Page/images/1351116165579.gif)  Huh?  Which church?	24
0	She used her real name and everything. It wasn't just a hoax to get a rise out of people. It was real. Not going to search for it on my work computer.	24
0	I heard something the other day, that people generally aren't convinced to change their minds based on new facts or better arguments. They change their minds because of their trust in someone who holds that belief.  Conversely, what convinced people that God isn't real is the example many Christians show with their lives. If you say you follow Jesus and you are a jerk, why would anyone believe in Jesus?  If you want people to believe in Jesus, live out the best possible example that you can.	24
0	Agreed. The point is that only one is actually viewed as wrong. Kinda brings back some of the original arguments against the gay lifestyle that it requires approval of pedophiles. This case of the major, who admitted to a crime, sadly proves that point is far more true that many might want to admit.	24
0	&gt; **No woman** skips to the abortion clinic singing, "Fa la la! I get to kill a baby today!"	24
0	Except that you have the whole lgbt community supporting a pedophile. The entire Christian community condemns violence.	24
0	The definition of marriage in the world, a sacrament in some christian traditions.	24
0	I'm curious as to what law they broke, I'm not asking out of spite but genuine curiousness. All I see here is one couple saying I'm sorry but we are unable to bake you a wedding cake to another couple because of their beliefs. As far as I'm aware of that's all they did, not blacklist them from the baking community, the gay couple could still have bought a cake from a different store.	24
0	17 years old. Underage. Pedophilia. LGBT community has no problem with it...assuming they ever really did.	24
0	Why freak out over a flag	24
0	I am sure he would insist. Nothing to see here. No investigation needed.	24
0	University of Notre Dame hosted two debates on religion which I though were really good   1. Christopher Hitchens vs Dinesh  D'Souza  (yeah I know D'Souza isn't the best example of a Christian, but he is a powerful debater)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V85OykSDT8  2. Sam Harris vs Lane Craig   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqaHXKLRKzg	24
0	Which is why Christians invented the concept of orphanages and have done more the aid the poor then any other group in history. Sadly, it is people such as yourself want to put an end to it by forcing Christians to commit murder, hire people who wish to see Christianity driven out of existence, etc. The very real harm non-Christians are doing to the poor is incalculable. Not to mention people having their teeth cleaned have a far safer regulatory environment then those having the very dangerous surgical abortion procedure - see Gosnell and look at the poor women he murdered...he was and is not a unique case.	24
0	Protestant/Catholics: cons- going to hell.  Orthodox: pros- cool robes.	24
0	I am against alcohol for the things it does to people, to cultures and to nations. This isn't a religious thing to me, as much as logical thinking. How many destruction do you need to see from a product to figure out that it probably isn't a good thing?  Drinking booze is dumber than smoking tobacco. And few things on Earth are as dumb as smoking tobacco.	24
0	Are you Reformed out of curiosity?	24
0	&gt; Today Arius would just go make The LDS church.  FTFY	24
0	Shit like this is persecution. Asking you to bake a cake is not. This is what the conservative radio airheads should be discussing. Not how Sharia is going to take over. Or how gay marriage will be the end of us all.	24
0	I do not share your confidence in taking the witness of the text at face value.	24
0	huh. Well, i don't find any of that to be true, and i think you'd be hard-pressed to find someone in Georgia that thinks that.	24
0	I would point to the study of ancient documents.  The New Testament has some really good backing for it being legit.  Men much smarter than me that have studied ancient documents, the process for recopying and the comparison of what we have left have written many many books on this point.  If a person is really interested, a simply Google search could give you several authors.	24
0	What don't you get?	24
0	This is more of a "discussing scripture" question, I was really looking for challenges to belief in Christianity in this particular thread.	24
0	oh, I got you now.  I think this is an interesting question.  The reason I would point to is that churches don't teach these things very often, to control yourself and have a healthy outlook.  The tools for success in these areas are in the hands of man already, as mental health professionals can attest to.  God created a world where you can sow the seed and reap the rewards, in the soil, in the mind, in the body.	24
0	The validity of holy text is relevant, but not line by line.  For an Atheist, if they believe just in Jesus, they would no longer be an Atheist and we could open up into debate about specific lines of scripture.	24
0	I don't see the difference between this and Hatred. If Hatred was put back up because of "free speech" or something then this game should be put back up too.	24
0	Boy I'm so glad the US is importing more drugged up death cultists.	24
0	Nope! Although, I do love to read theologian and philosophy books.	24
0	I know that people thousands of years ago liked to romanticize relationships, and use them as metapors, but "bride" literally means the thing you fuck. Saying it in modern day is totally unnecessary and ridiculous imagery.	24
0	The text clearly says its going to cause an abortion though. The fact that in reality its random stuff that wouldn't really it just an indication that the people at the time clearly didn't have a real divine mandate for what they were doing. They thought they were doing that, and that's what they wrote down. And that's something that has to be taken into account.	24
0	Probably not since I then added, "No!" Would you follow the inspiration and say that Captain America is a great moral teacher and you should follow everything he said and did?	24
0	ALS is that one illness that you get and literally cannot do a fucking thing about it. Anyone and everyone who gets it is fucked. Theres not percentages of survival or percent chance of it getting worse. It will. Nothing you can do. Evil wicked shit I tell you	24
0	&gt; The Church in its truth and fullness, with the laity, the priests, the deacons, the bishops are never wrong.  You just made my day with that one, fantastic joke!  I think you forgot to put in sarcasm tags  &gt;The One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church has survived the horrors and downsides of history.   Which one, the Catholic, or the Orthodox?  They are not a unified body	24
0	&gt;I disagree. The Church, which I'll asume means any organized Christian denomination(correct me if I'm wrong), has fucked up a lot.  This is obvious, and quite plain.  Of course it has, it is made many, many, many mistakes through history.  It is run by imperfect humans, of course it has.  To claim the "rightness" BS is almost insane.  I also think is a little blasphemous as well.	24
0	Why would I be trying to go etymological? The etymological fallacy is considered incorrect for a reason.	24
0	i guess it's fair to ask why some women dress in this way...what's the purpose, the psychology and so on. it can't be for comfort or because it's hot outside when they could wear a light cotton cape type thing instead. What's the 'end-game' to dressing like this	24
0	That's not really the point. Saying that the forced abortion only works some of the time doesn't change what the intent was, nor the content, nor the fact that it was more or less made to satiate pure jealousy, which is disingenuous for anyone to use hijinks to try to rationalize into a God that later decides abortion for trivial reasons is wrong.	24
0	The term ends. Patience is *long*-suffering, not *forever*-suffering. But for us? *long* is life's entire duration.	24
0	Umm...well, I don't think that exactly counts. I honestly doubt they were really thinking about that back then really.   That thought of perhaps ignorance doesn't reflect on what they saw to be true in their eyes. Unless, you knew and saw something 100% as true you wouldn't be in their shoes and know it to be true. I'm not talking about terrorists because those Christians weren't terrorists.	24
0	You know that words have meanings, right? You don't have to look into secret subtle meanings as if you're confused about the regular one. Marriage in general is formulated around an arrangement that is sexual. A word to specify the sexual arrangement is in fact itself. To act like there's some other context marriage exists in that has nothing to do with sex is trying to crowbar in non common cases because they're technically possible.	24
0	No I want to learn the song of the lord.	24
0	What's wrong with it?	24
0	Because there was money to be made, and it had a stranglehold/monopoly on the vast majority of the literate people who had the time to actually write/copy books?   To use that same argument, other older religious books/theological works from other parts of the world would give equal weight to those.	24
0	I think the proliferation of lethal mobile metal boxes in the 20th century helped change our perspective on alcohol as well.	24
0	That has nothing to do with anything? Why would someone doing something wrong make abortion okay? Also, I'm not sure why you're putting it in quotes. The verse openly states that this can be done "if the husband is jealous" with this being the only justification that's apparently needed.	24
0	Oh gotcha. It was fine in my old religion. My bad.	24
0	It is indeed a shame how convinced people can become of heresy.	24
0	Considering Florida does not allow Catholics (or anyone else who holds the Consitutions to be indefensible) to vote, I put the lowest score for the first question.	24
0	Pretty sure you're fine as long as you don't get shitfaced with such frequency that it affects your life.	24
0	Come on now, there's a difference between a pizzeria saying they won't cater a gay wedding and a video game about murdering LGBT people. One is refusing pizza, the other is advocating murder.  The Dieseltec place had a failed fundraising campaign when it said it would refuse to serve LGBT people.  This guy won't make any money.	24
0	&gt;please keep him in your thoughts and/or prayers.  Well, he'll be in my prayers BUT CERTAINLY NOT IN MY THOUGHTS! Imagine that, praying *and* thinking about him, who in the world has that kind of time?	24
0	&gt;Never underestimate the power of fear.   I don't, its mainly the fact that I think those that are against gay weddings don't think LGBT people should get killed, and a business that said it would refuse LGBT people service had a failed fundraising campaign. So a game based on killing LGBT people really isn't going to do all that well.  Maybe it'll gain a really fringe following like the game *Ethnic Cleansing* but this isn't going to be very successful.	24
0	Uhm...Marcion was a heretic. For more than just his attempt to tamper with scripture.	24
0	Christian Science for the lose.	24
0	I guess he claims to be - that doesn't mean his actions reflect what is morally acceptable for practising Catholics, however.	24
0	I'm sure you'll find a church that fits all of your preferences (gay-friendly, able to let you be visible/invisible at your exact timing, comfortable, and full of people that look/act like you).  And when you find this church, it won't ask anything significant of you, and it won't disrupt your allegiances.	24
0	True story. Just an FYI SingleCellOrganism is an active JW. The whole topic of JW's and the Nazi's is quite an intricate and interesting one. Here's a great read: http://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/hitler-nazi.php	24
0	&gt; If ... we are called not to judge those outside the church, ...  False premise...  &gt; secular reasoning  With secular reasoning, government has no authority and is indistinct from organised crime. It is *only* because God grants the State limited authority of His, that government has any jurisdiction at all.  Not all moral matters need to be legislated, of course, but arguing laws shouldn't be based on morality is the same as arguing there shouldn't be any laws at all.	24
0	There is also the possibility that God (spiritual source consciousness) did not choose the Hebrew people in some special manner above other people, but the Yahweh anthropomorphic being perhaps did.	24
0	No. I love my alcoholic friends. I don't really call them my alcoholic friends, but I love my friends.	24
0	[watches video]  Good God, every time I see it I'm just struck anew by how damn hideous that sanctuary is.	24
0	&gt;I no longer do. I just gave up Christianity today.  You gave up Christianity today?  Congratulations.  I hope things go well for you.  Please let me know if there's anything I can help with or if you have any questions I might be able to answer.  &gt;However, creation could imply a lot of things. There would be more mysteries to uncover.  There's a huge number of mysteries to uncover now.  Why would the mysteries be better or more interesting if they're from a mind?	24
0	That's almost like saying that antisemitism doesn't exist in the west because it's nothing compared to nazism where the real persecution took place.  Persecution doesn't have to come in the form of a gun to the head, it can be in other ways too.  In my country there is a women who has been in prison for 8 years for protesting against abortion, they wouldn't let us open a law school because they feel we are bigots.  To deny this religious based discrimination just because we aren't being outright killed is just ridiculous.	24
0	Catholic doctrine requires the State to recognise God as its source of authority, at the very least.  In other words, that section would probably be acceptable if it were rewritten as such:  &gt; There shall be no law ~~respecting the establishment of religion or~~ prohibiting or penalizing the free exercise [of religion] ~~thereof~~. Religious freedom shall not justify practices inconsistent with public morals, peace or safety. No revenue of the state or any political subdivision or agency thereof shall ever be taken from the public treasury directly or indirectly in aid of any church, sect, or religious denomination or in aid of any sectarian institution.	24
0	It just feels like you think you're superior to your friend.	24
0	I do all those things happily, because I know I could have (or could still) be in the same situation.	24
0	Funny, for a site all about "equality" reddit sure is quiet on this one. Must not fit their agenda.	24
0	Because the bible is the only way to learn about God. Right?	24
0	They're allowed to like better things.  More to the point though, if you think your children are being wronged *by not being marketed junk* you should be shipped to one of the countries where they are thankful to get [t-shirts from the super bowl losers](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-happens-to-super-bowl-losers-shirts-2014-1).	24
0	This problem does not in any way de-legitimise the State's authority (which still comes from God, despite the State's denial of this fact).	24
0	Possibly, I forgot there are some secular anti-consumerism people.	24
0	Right, I forgot the part where you get to judge people, moreover, kids, for liking cool things that you think are inferior.   Thanks for telling me I should suffer for having a different opinion.	24
0	is it? it's about a born again president. i am stating how i am impressed with how his life turned around after he became born again. not sure how that is political.	24
0	That was my opinion and the opinion of those who like it.   You strike me as an intensely cynical and self-righteous person.	24
0	Is there a spelling mistake in that post? I'm confused.	24
0	Speaking of the pink....Have you seen [this monstrosity](http://imgur.com/YAsdTOG)?   And we wonder why some of our girls grow up to be vapid bimbos? Ughhhhhh	24
0	&gt; He's the dude who talks tough to cops and challenges them.   Challenging the federal agents at unconstitutional Nazi border patrol checkpoints is a good thing.  He's not going out of his way to bother them, they are bothering people by setting up these checkpoints and trying to get everyone to show their papers.  Personally, I think his illustrations are often hilarious.  So great job OP, all you are doing is giving him more attention.	24
0	Murder is always gravely immoral of course. Even when it's part of IVF.	24
0	&gt;They did?  That's a relief.  Not a big surprise, though; not only was that garage much more nasty, but the novelty of supporting businesses with fundraising campaigns was bound to wear off.  Yeah, they didn't get any money and GoFundMe shut down their campaign early as well.   I think people saw through Dieseltec as just looking for funds, and also they said they would just bar LGBT people from service where as Memories Pizzeria said they wouldn't cater a gay wedding not ban all LGBT people.	24
0	Catholicism never changes (nothing perfect does). Your observation that Vatican II contradicts Catholic doctrine is itself proof that Vatican II is not Catholic.	24
0	You are saying that the only possible way a God could create reality is the way you see fit. Why?	24
0	&gt;I wouldn't frame it in the condemnatory language of 'jwfacts', which is basically an attack site against us witnesses,  Seriously? an "attack site"? Is that what you have been told to believe? I wasn't aware that exposing heresies or misdeeds of the WT was an attack..	24
0	Exactly what things *are* young children allowed to enjoy?	24
0	Do you have a basis for that? If not, it's Ok, I'm just curious	24
0	Interesting. What makes you believe that? I often hear the opinion that the soul is created in the moment of conception	24
0	Isn't the current president BJP?  You have to wonder how terrible the party is that the Economist would chuck their core preferences to the wind and ask people to vote against them in favor of one of the most corrupt, inept presidents India has ever had. Says a lot about the BJP (though I'd comment more about their anti-Muslim policies)	24
0	Why haven't there been any attempts to try and re-unify the church?	24
0	Masturbation isn't a temptation, it's an act, a succumbing to said temptation. It takes human sexuality out of the realm of mutual collaborative effort and puts it in the realm of self-centered, self-gratifying effort. In that sense, yeah, I think it's a bad thing to do.	24
0	Wow, TIL something new about Catholicism? Thanks New Mexico school system. /s	24
0	Not true. If doctrine or teaching is flat out wrong then yes we must go back to the Truth. The Protestants have contributed much but it's time they move back into the fold.	24
0	Schismatic churches hold completely different teachings and doctrines. The Eastern and Oriental and Catholic agree that the Chalcedonian formulas are more or less the same (official agreements with the Catholics and unofficial ones with the Orthodox).	24
0	I totally get you.  The person who looks with lust is just as bad as the woman with her boobs on show or the brother in tight jeans.	24
0	Gibberish doesn't have to be abstract sounds. It means any high level of nonsense that doesn't seem to be meaningfully coherent, even if it uses real words. The fact that people are accountable for something that they by definition are not accountable for due to it being fundamentally impossible to not be part of it is basically gobbledygook. Its a contradiction that seems to not know it is one and is making what appears to be an argument that's actually an incorrect assumption based on nothing. And ignores one of the [most important](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ought_implies_can) concepts that ethics in general is based on.	24
0	1 Corinthians 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.	24
0	/u/wretched_sinner , what are your thoughts on this?	24
0	I really have to ask what's with the change of flair?	24
0	Everyone forgets what Adam did in the garden.  People like to blame God for the crap in the world, but God is like "dudes... It wasn't me"	24
0	I think that you're missing the point.	24
0	The Anglican Church was formed out of a political fuss - nothing more. They have lost holy orders by allowed woman into the priesthood and tarnishing the sacraments.	24
0	It's a wonderful experience. In it's fullness and understanding one begins to see Christianity in the Truest sense of the word.	24
0	It's not arguing .. it's open discussion it's ignorance of history at this point. Many here are extremely well intentioned but there are obviously vast differences in teaching between the churches.	24
0	It depends a) how old the child was and b) the parent's response.	24
0	&gt;if you left someone with no knowledge of God, or other people even for that matter, alone on an island full of animal and plant life, he is expected to come to the "obvious" conclusion that there is not only a god, but its the God of the Bible that a man named Jesus spoke of, and was God incarnate, and this lonely man is expected to draw all those conclusions by observing nature before his life ends and he meets eternity  Yes.  &gt; his leads me to believe, that if salvation is real, that there is more then one avenue to obtain i  and you would be wrong.	24
0	Again, you are missing the whole point.	24
0	&gt; I don't understand how that would happen without divine intervention  What does scripture say ?  "Whoever seeks will find, and whoever knocks, the door will be opened"	24
0	I love how quickly the community downvotes dissenting opinions	24
0	you said that as long as there is no doctrinal heresy, its good. so therefore a church that has a doctrinal heresy is one of the signs of the false church?   do you agree that the bible should be the bases of all doctrines? a doctrine that is not written in the bible is wrong? and churches that are teaching doctrines which are not written in the bible are false churches?	24
0	The propaganda cycle continues on this sub.	24
0	There is proof of God, those people just aren't looking for it. To say math and science disproves God is untrue. They don't even scratch the surface of human existence.  You don't *have* to take it on the words of a book. You read the book and realize it speaks truth, put your faith in God and get humbled.	24
0	Tell me, what do you view as attractive in somebody? Because that attraction (especially physical) stem from an urge to reproduce. What you view as attractive traits is your brain genetically evaluating that person for good genes to potentially reproduce with. In addition, I am not saying shallowness is exclusively necessary, and in the long run there are a *host* of other, non genetic traits (personality, how kind the person is etc) that are just as, if not *more* important than just genes.	24
0	Sorry. I know how infuriating that is for me when that happens to me. Would you like me to try to explain my position then?	24
0	How? Sexual selection is a proven thing. We know what reproduction is for scientifically speaking.	24
0	Yes, and those traits are equally, if not more important than genes. But genes are still important.	24
0	&gt;Doesnt mean they choose right  What does that mean?	24
0	you should not use Church instruments to activities or things that are not related to worship. It should only be used for Church activities.    let us read, 1 Corinthians 14:40  40 Let all things be done decently and in order.  in the church, let ALL things be done DECENTLY AND IN ORDER.  Church instruments should only be used for church things.  i am not saying that we are not allowed to sing rock music etc. or musics that are of the world, no. what i am trying to say is that, Church instruments should be treated as holy.	24
0	proving the authenticity of the scripture is not the talk right now. I will set a different topic on that. My thing is a christian thing. if you can notice on my post, it says " according to the BIBLE". so therefore, it refers to biblical issues.   are you atheists? do not worry, i will post a topic for all atheists about proving the authenticity of the bible and i will prove to you that the bible is authentic.   but that is not the topic right now.	24
0	The thief on the cross is not a good example. AFTER that, Jesus gave the Great Commission to baptize. So if Jesus commanded us to baptized (and by extension be baptized) then we don't try to use arguments like the thief to bypass that.	24
0	&gt; how can God expect me to believe based off of words in a book?      Because math and science are words in books too.      &gt; How is it fair to condemn someone to hell for being skeptical of that?      Don't condemn anyone to hell, even yourself.      You have several problems first is some sort of verficiationism or material reductionism.  Somehow you also seem to have a very exclusionary view of salvation.  Christ is the only way to the Father, but that doesn't limit salvation to those who have made a certain profession or action.      We know God exists because the world exists and is contingent.	24
0	It's a sin, therefore no?	24
0	Some of pastors, who I know, answer my questions even about which have nothing to do with Christianity as if they themselves were God per se and they were right at any time.	24
0	Jesus is God. God does not sin. Masturbation is a sin. Ergo, Jesus cannot have masturbated.	24
0	Well, all I can say is that God has said whoever seeks will find... so.. keep seeking, and be open to God telling you things that you might not want to hear :)	24
0	The music industry is full of the occult... it hides in plain sight, so much so that even my non-religious friends are pointing it out to me.	24
0	yea. it has become a joke now	24
0	Not looking for a  sign, nor making a statement about the 7500 dead. (looks like you haven't been paying attention) The point is, an incredible synchronicity took place.  That's significant if anything.	24
0	the church that is in the bible has an official name and is in unity. You can find them in One body. There is only one body and all the members of the church are in One body, they are not scattered to different churches.	24
0	what is that church? name?	24
0	There is a history of people claiming it, yes. All people benefiting from it.	24
0	Yeah. It sounds nice, and I can definitely agree with *"be more like Jesus,"* but the rest doesn't really jive with scripture, IMO.    There's a reason why people are saying things like "it parallels with Buddhist teachings," and that he should read Rob Bell's book that denies the existence of a literal heaven or hell.	24
0	That was one awesome reaction. http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2VVNgk6i-gA/Tgzdlxf0qhI/AAAAAAAAAIs/4NFch1UKmoU/s1600/June+21.gif	24
0	According to Pope Francis, it is possible for people of other faiths and atheists to enter Heaven.  However, most protestants are firm in the "through Christ only" belief.	24
0	&gt; According to Pope Francis, it is possible for people of other faiths and atheists to enter Heaven  And he would be wrong.	24
0	Good luck giving me any other logical explanation which requires actually critical thought other than "Because God said so" and I might take that seriously. Also, this isn't a debate thread, so please keep your snark off of me	24
0	~~Check out rule 1.5, no reaction gifs.~~ Nvm, apparently it's fine.  &gt;I keep it on hand whenever a Christian tells me I deserve to go to hell.   All deserve to go to hell.  All without Christ's righteousness imputed to their account *will* go to hell.  That is a fact.	24
0	There is agnostic atheism, agnostic theism, and pragmatic agnosticism (basically the laymans definition of agnosticism). OP is most likely the first.	24
0	This simply isn't the case. There are a number of people who have lost their faith after investigating. There are no testable proofs otherwise science would accept the concept of God. God cannot be proven. That is why we have faith and belief. Because we believe that we see things that indicate a deity. It's by no means proof though. And the bible is full of things that are very contradictory so people should be wary of TRUTH. I think finding God is more of a feeling than something that can be found. That said, there are certain truths in the bible which make sense.	24
0	I think if there is a God who is truly loving and just, he would understand why people like yourself are unable to believe in a deity without empirical evidence, and he would let you into his home.	24
0	No one is innocent. (Romans 3:10-12)  He doesn't kill innocent people since innocent people don't exist, however He does kill wicked people.

0	&gt; Then that puts you outside of the historic and ancient church and the faith of the Apostles. &gt; Christianity and Christian doctrine is not based on the Bible. In fact the reverse is true.   - This is wrong accusation, "Christianity and Christian doctrine is not based on the Bible. In fact the reverse is true."  but let me ask you first before i attack you, if the christian doctrine is NOT based on the bible, where then we should based it? tradition? culture? inventions like rosary? purgatory? limbo? where?	24
0	&gt; That seems more agnostic than atheist to me.  That must be because you don't know the actual difference. An atheist is someone who doesn't believe in god. An agnostic is someone who says he doesn't know or that it is unknowable if there is a god. The two are not mutually exclusive and most atheists, at least in the Western world (and on Reddit) are both.	24
0	Jesus kept the Sabbath. God's law is not done away with. The reason Jesus didn't ask them to keep the Sabbath is because they already understood and did.  Yes, I am a Seventh Day Adventist.	24
0	Me neither. I think there's something oddly...narcissistic about a good, fortunate thing happening in a Christian's life, making them believe that God intervened, bestowing a miracle upon them, because it completely ignores the suffering and torment endured by millions all across the globe. You'd essentially have to believe that there is something special about you, and that you deserve special treatment over other human beings who arguably need miracles much more.	24
0	It's pretty crazy to think that you as one person can influence any deity to help you, considering there are 6 billion people in this world.	24
0	I believe God intervenes in our physical world as He sees fit according to His will. I think deism is an easy belief to fall into as it lessens the problem of evil, but I don't think it fits with the Christian belief that God is love. Nor does it fit with Scripture nor Church tradition.	24

0	[Antichrist is already in power](http://www.bibleprophecytruth.com/topics/who-is-the-antichrist-.aspx). It has been since 538 AD, though its mortal wound was received 1260 years later in 1778.  We have known this truth since the reformation, but today it is covered up and the wound is heal(ing/ed). Protestants everywhere are being duped as the whole world wonders after the beast.  EDIT: If anyone feels offended, please be reminded that I have nothing but love for you all. We fight not against flesh and blood!	24
0	He insinuated that Christians are narcissistic, self-centered and irrational by the very virtue of believing in Christ. It's more than "close" to anti-theist rhetoric.  The baffling part is that he considered himself to be writing from a Christian perspective according to his other reply.	24
0	What is the scriptural basis for the concept of *forgiving yourself*?	24

0	&gt; Plus, his new health plan has caused many doctors to leave their job.   It's also caused me to be able to get healthcare.   &gt;Also, it's really annoying when Obama calls himself a Christian when he clearly is not.  [eyeroll]  &gt;Especially since he something like, "The future doesn't belong to those who slander the prophet Mohammad." I've done it many times and I'm not dead yet.   No, it just makes you childish.	24
0	From the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith:   &gt;4 The Lord Jesus Christ is the Head of the church, in whom, by the appointment of the Father, all power for the calling, institution, order or government of the church, is invested in a supreme and sovereign manner; neither can the Pope of Rome in any sense be head thereof, but is that antichrist, that man of sin, and son of perdition, that exalteth himself in the church against Christ, and all that is called God; whom the Lord shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.   Is this theological statement allowed to be affirmed here?	24
0	You are not a catholic neither atheist. Anyways, what are you trying to prove here? Dont you want to put your church into a test? Who knows that your church is the true church?	24
0	Then what about all those Christians who can testify that they are not just surviving, but thriving without the Eucharist?	24
0	&gt;Remember that the Cathars held strategic seaports to the south and arable land.   Well shit, that totally makes it okay to rape and murder a million people	24
0	Apparently not. Real protestantism is the only theology that is against the rules because it's the truth.  They call it bigotry but I share the truth out of love. "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues."	24
0	It really depends on your denomination. I've heard a wide range of views on this subject matter.    http://www.astudyofdenominations.com/denominations/#sthash.q9HlwFHW.dpbs	24
0	&gt; I'm fine with such a quote simply being downvoted.  You would downvote a theological response to a theological answer simply because you disagree with it? I implore you to read the Reddiquette do's and dont's.  From the Reddiquette:  Please don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.   If the OP asks for opinions about the identity of the antichrist, and a protestant responds with their opinion (which is a historic protestant opinion), he is contributing to the thread. The downvote button is for posts that do not contribute, NOT for answers you don't like. (Scroll over it to see that)	24
0	It's been re-approved, so that would be unnecessary. I apologize for the controversy, but I do not speak out of bigotry... only love.	24
0	That's a false analogy. You cannot, reasonable, equate the actions of a person with that of a computer program.   However, I did ask if you believed the actions of man are that [totally] deterministic. I guess you're sticking with that position but I hoped you wouldn't since you alluded to genetics only be partially responsible. So within your world view, humans cannot (ethically or otherwise) be held responsible for any of their actions. They are simply the peons of a God or evolution who have no agency whatsoever.	24
0	&gt; but I don't think it fits with the Christian belief that God is love.   Then God is not omnibenevolent and is not perfect	24
0	The water is not poisoned, it is not a medical procedure, the water does not physically induce miscarriage. It is a spiritual curse that if a woman should drink the holy water under the observance of the priest while in the lie of her sin, that God should induce in her a miscarriage.	24
0	Yeah, they sure defend them hard enough.  There is a whole apologist movement in modern academia that I discovered for myself last night that seeks to show that the Catholic holocaust of various groups was just a "myth".	24
0	Go ahead, but you'll probably get bored.	24
0	I disagree, I don't think forgiving yourself is a scriptural concept - we focus on repentance and rebirth.  Feeling excessive guilt is not a scriptural concept, but forgiving yourself isn't really scriptural either imo.  Feeling guilty is a part of repentence, and repentance is the key to spiritual renewal .	24
0	I almost married a Presbyterian. Lucky for me, she called it off. It would've been a disaster.	24
0	Only to the extent that the preacher will normally wear a suit and tie, or the female equivalent.	24
0	Looks like my warning was too late for you. God is not a personal experience. He is an infinite and eternal being beyond our ability to understand. your personal experience is a tiny glimpse into that greater reality. You have to put your experience into context with other peoples experiences if you want to understand God better. For that we have the Bible.	24
0	I mean, if there was a heaven, would you want to go there? That seems to me like the first question to ask yourself.	24
0	It was a huge mistake. My wife was "spiritual, but not religious." I was attending church every sunday, thursday night and even tuesday night, to boot. As far as I'm concerned, "spiritual, but not religious" means-- "I'm an immoral cretin."	24

0	So you believe that Christians that don't partake of the Eucharist have no life in them and no salvation in them?	24
0	I went to a Lutheran church the other day and took communion. Nobody knew who me and my sister were, or that we were atheists. We just came to see a liturgical service since we'd never seen one before. Some lady told us everyone is welcome at the Lord's table, so we just did what everyone else did. It saves us from some awkwardness when people notice we didn't take it, and we don't believe there's anything spiritual or magical about it, so why wouldn't we? It's just a thing you do at church, and we were at church, so we took it.	24
0	This article is written by a 15year old girl that goes to my church. It's pretty great.	24
0	None of the verses in Romans 8 have anything to do with *forgiving yourself.*  They have to do with being *justified by Christ*.	24
0	The bible makes *no reference* to the concept of forgiving oneself.	24
0	There is precisely as much scriptural support for nuclear fusion as there is for forgiving yourself.  Forgiving yourself is a concept that arises out of pop-psychology, not out of biblical Christianity.	24

0	I suspect it is because people are far more enamored of thinking that *forgiving yourself* is some "Christian teaching" even though the bible is utterly silent on the topic.  In my experience, people are far more interested in projecting what they want to believe onto Christianity than they are of hearing what the bible actually teaches.     Or so it seems to me,      TETH	24
0	*Julius Caesar's existence* can't be so confirmed...	24
0	I'm not ignoring your question.  I'm explicitly pointing out that the bible does *not* talk about *forgiving yourself*.  That may be a painful observation, but it is the truth none-the-less.	24
0	&gt;I'd argue a virtuous life is an enriched one (not necessarily a happy one)  Actually, doing acts of virtue (generosity, giving gifts etc) actually stimulates the reward centres of your brain, making you happy. At least for a time.	24
0	Those with such notions do not need to be taught the so-called "logical ramification" of forgiving themselves. They need to be taught that their sins are against God, not against themselves.	24
0	&gt; As soon as somebody says they're anti-vaccination, their opinion on just about everything immediately becomes worthless to me.  That is a rather strange, and totally unproductive prejudice.	24
0	&gt;I never said "logical ramifications," so I'm not sure who you're quoting.   A "logical ramification" is a "logical inference".  Ironically logic is required to make that inference.   &gt;Where is this explicitly in scripture?   Romans 8, which teaches about the logical inferences and ramifications of being justified in Christ and forgiven by God.	24
0	While you're right that different compounds act differently in various circumstances, the mercury in vaccines *does* actually metabolize into toxic ethylmercury. It is toxic at high doses. There's a reason the FDA stopped recommending vaccines containing thiomersal to children.  That said, the amount found in those vaccines which still do contain it is extremely low.	24
0	You really don't have to respond to every iconoclast in the thread with how you feel about their stance.	24
0	Sorry, I am willing to accept advice. Not a troll post. I guess my post came off otherwise - but please do feel free to criticize my views and I will make whatever necessary changes. I just don't know where to start.	24
0	My point is that even if I did cut out the sexual aspect of it, I would still be thinking about and obsessing over devils.	24
0	Games are pretty much fundamentally arbitrary, so I don't really think the same moral considerations apply.	24
0	Fetishes are not typically sinful, especially when they aren't carried out. I've heard of weirder fetishes, honestly. 4chan is a terrible place.	24
0	Has it though?  It is almost the same selective logic used by antivaxers to the facts.  I find it interesting that people in this area just want to hate on antivaxers rather than try to solve the problem.  It is hardly loving our neighbour/enemy.	24
0	Obviously I can't carry this one out. But a large issue is that I *want* to be sinful so that I'll end up in Hell. I want to be tortured for eternity in the afterlife by muscular devils. I'm trying to make sure my sins don't affect others but the dichotomy of wanting to be sinful so that I end up in Hell while also wanting to be a good person and have a good moral code is difficult.	24
0	Well no, I still have good relationships with people and I'm doing fine in school. On the outside, nobody would know that I have this obsession.	24
0	You consider it heresy, but not everyone sees authority in the official list of heresies and there's a wide range of opinions regarding icons throughout the church at large. Almost every iconoclast who has posted in this thread has gotten a reply from you asserting the heresy ruling as the final say on the matter when I know you know that most iconoclasts aren't a part of the capital C Church.  Your stance and the Church's stance aren't the only stance, and "correcting" people who you know don't follow the Church's authority by pointing to Church rulings is passive aggressive at best.	24
0	It's just something I've never heard of from anybody else.. I'm not sure how I feel about it yet.	24
0	And what do I do about my faith?	24
0	It seems to me like you would fit in perfectly over at /r/StrongRedDevils. There is nothing wrong with the way you view demons. Feed it, don't ever avoid it.	24

0	What is hell like then?	24
0	Just desires. Not intrusive at all. I welcome them.	24
0	Not going to cross the bridge until we get there.	24
0	I guess I don't mean portrayed in the Bible, but as it has been portrayed by sunday school teachers and media, etc.	24
0	Honestly that doesn't sound so bad. As long as there are devils down there, I can be happy.	24
0	That really sounds fine to me. Better than fine actually.	24
0	If a single iconoclast had gone around countering every noniconoclast in this thread, you'd be the one complaining about passive aggression. This happens every time this type of thread gets posted, it just depends on the moon cycle which side is "correcting" the other side's personal beliefs.	24
0	He just commented so I didn't know a group like his existed when I originally posted.	24
0	If you're going to exclude the opinions of everyone who doesn't see the Church as authoritative, you're going to exclude half of Christendom. What is and is not heresy is not universally agreed upon, so countering someone's beliefs with "oh that's wrong, I know you thought it was reasonable but the Church has said no" is meaningless on its own.	24
0	This is the right answer to the conundrum I think.	24
0	&gt; At least here in the East, there are a *lot* of people  That is hyperbole.  &gt; so many people in the East are convinced that *anything* from the West is anathema.   If this were true, there would have already been a big schism within Orthodoxy over acceptance of the Western rite.  &gt; I can't speak to the West, though.   The West has its own crazies.  One of their criticisms of Vatican Jr. is that it was too accommodating of the East.	24
0	I find that hard to believe.	24
0	No, the source of happiness for me WOULD be hell. It would be demons and muscles and the color red. Sure, hell for the general populace would be an awful place. For me, it would be wonderful. Surely there isn't more than one hell. God can't be powerful enough to generate a separate hell for each and every person.	24
0	She sounds like an idiot. So much click-bait lately around here.	24
0	This snottiness was exactly my original complaint, albeit you're more upfront about it.  This is not /r/Catholicism or /r/Orthodoxy, and other Christians will be here. Build a bridge and get over it.	24
0	It's /r/Christianity, and heretics are not to be tolerated in Christianity.	24
0	Well when I posted originally only three iconoclasts had responded and the third had gotten a similar correction from someone else so it was very much the direction the thread seemed to be heading.  He didn't correct a wrongful view of iconodulism in the comment I responded to, someone gave their scriptural reasoning and he basically said "no, that's doesn't forbid what you feel it does, this council you may or may not accept as valid said so". That's not a correction, and I'd seen his name doing the same thing over and over in the thread.	24
0	&gt;will enforce the particulars of any person's individual religious beliefs  Which arguably can't and/or won't be done. If you're not enforcing Christianity's understanding of marriage, you'll be enforcing a humanist understanding of marriage. There is no neutral, there is no ideological vacuum, there isn't true nothingness in the absence of a religious institution of marriage. The Christian definition of marriage is being forced out to make way for the secular humanist view of marriage. Christians have a right, as the secular humanists do, to contend for their value system in the public square.	24
0	Anyone can file a lawsuit in court about anything.  Do we have to report and make a big deal out of every stupid thing every single individual does in the name of Christianity?  I'm sure if I looked hard enough I could find something stupid a gay marriage proponent does too.  It's like we're just sitting on the side lines waiting for any stupid thing to come out of anyone on the other side.	24
0	Having sex kills tons of embryos. Many of those don't implant either. This isn't any different.	24
0	&gt;Bonhoeffer gave his life to stop the persecution and murder of minorities that DISAGREED with his religion. He was a living breathing incarnation of loving your neighbor and treating your neighbor as you would want to be treated.  So the last will be first....  &gt;The current crop of Evangelical leaders are going all out to inflict segregation, discrimination, and persecution upon a minority who disagrees with them. They couldn't be farther from the example of Bonhoeffer if they tried.  ...and the first, last.	24
0	I meant agnostic as in the Holy Spirit being something real, while at the same time I believe it is described in other religions than Christianity such as chi or prana in eastern religions.  The word agnostic is perhaps not exactly correct, but it was the closest I could think of. In hindsight the word integral would probably have been better to use in the title.	24

0	Rosaries are Totally Depraved. I mean, I would definitely Unconditionally Elect a governor who pledged to ban them (preferably a Saint, who would Persevere) completely. I guess I'd support some kind of Limited Atonement, if they throw away those silly beads for good, but of course eventually they'll do so. The change is Irresistible.	24
0	Well what are they then?	24
0	&gt; but He was crystal clear that any divorcee that remarried was an adulterer who will never see heaven.  I don't think he said any such thing.   Something.. something...except for unfaithfulness.. something.	24
0	That's a horrible metaphor.   Sex and invitro kill just almost the same number of embryos why is one better than  the other?	24
0	Well, from my view point, when someone is enjoying sin, they enjoy it less and less as they get closer to Jesus in their heart.  I don't think we could expect non-Christians to not be in gay relationships if that is what they wanted.  So, I point people to Jesus, help them get closer and let God do all the heavy lifting.	24
0	I have no doubt at all that Bonhoeffer would have publicly convicted the wild and false accusations of the religious right against gays.  He would have publicly convicted and challenged the Christian activists who are bearing false witness against gays in their public statements.  At no point in my comments have I suggested that Bonhoeffer would have endorsed gay marriage.  I am addressing myself to the vile public utterances of those claiming him for their talisman.  Have you seen what they have been claiming over the last three weeks?  Where are the honest Christian ministers to call them on this false witness, and to pronounce to the community that Christianity does not accord itself with this bigotry and violence?	24
0	I know it's more than that to you, but we are not you. We are atheists. From our perspective, it's one of the things people do at church, among many other ceremonies and activities. There was no reason for us not to do what everyone else did, so we did.	24

0	&gt;The current crop of Evangelical leaders are going all out to inflict segregation, discrimination, and persecution upon a minority who disagrees with them.  Stopped reading here.	24
0	Well technically it doesn't imply that, in much the same way that not believing in a god doesn't necessitate an *uncaused* universe. They could just as easily be in some sort of artificial womb without ever having been inside a woman (Not that those exist but I hope you get my point).    Anyway, I deliberately didn't mention the mother because it wasn't relevant to my point about each of them believing / not believing without evidence since they have reason to suspect that she exists.	24
0	I'm not sure that your making a valid argument here.  We aren't talking about which religion is right. We are speaking to the existence of God. I am speaking from the Christian position, so I don't really care about the others. What is wrong with other religions is a different discussion.	24
0	You know if I was an atheist and I had no life, I would sit around on Christian forums getting all angry at people on the internet and yelling crap abut Christians for not being like me.	24
0	No. They're both consequences  of nature. Not all embryos implant.	24
0	Hard to believe or not, it wasn't recorded, so I'm not going to make assumptions. Plus I could drink at least ten bottles and not get drunk over like five days.	24
0	Well, no one there has any idea we were any different from them, so who is it hurting? They can't possibly take offense if they are completely unaware they need to be offended. Plus, when someone comes up to me and tells me I'm welcome to do what everyone else does, refusing to do so only draws unwanted attention to myself. I see no reason why I shouldn't have accepted the offer, and clearly no one there did either.	24
0	Be sure to look into the original: the Catholic Church. And avoid getting confused by the Modernists (under the leadership of "Pope" Francis, who is not a real pope) who call themselves Catholic despite not adhering to the Catholic Faith in union with the popes of the Catholic Church. If you need help finding an authentic Catholic church near you, feel free to ask; [someone has a combined directory here](http://www.ecclesia.luxvera.org/Directory-USA.html), although I don't know how reliable it is (anything *not* labelled as "IND" or "???" should be a safe bet though).	24

0	&gt; So you too will walk with Him no more?  According to you i (and million of other born again Christians) were never walking with Christ to begin with and we have no life or salvation in us because we don't put emphasis on Eucharist like you do.	24

0	Hobby Lobby has deeply held religious beliefs as they so often tell us.  They say they are even willing to shut down all their stores to honor their beliefs.  They buy a lot of goods from China so all I can assume is that the link above is an indirect attack on Hobby Lobby by the secular progressive left who hats Hobby Lobby.	24
0	&gt; Clearly, if we believe the literal wording of the Bible, there was indeed a universal creative event during the seven days of Genesis, about 6,000 literal years ago. But the literal wording of the Bible and the Earth's geology reveals that there is more to the story - it was not the original creation of all things. Understanding the time gap in Genesis opens a vast knowledge gap. You just can't rely on your own understanding or the traditions of man to obtain this knowledge. You have to TRUST THE BOOK.  K-Ken Ham? Is th-that you?	24
0	&gt;2-3% is an extremely conservative estimate, 10% is more inline with what we currently know  Source?  Wikipedia's sources look more like the 3-6% range, at least in the US:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_United_States	24
0	To those not already familiar, I recommend checking out [Vax!: Gamifying Epidemic Prevention](http://vax.herokuapp.com/): http://vax.herokuapp.com/  It's a game that illustrates the basics of herd immunity and outbreak prevention. Not only is it short, sweet, and fun, but I've found it introduces the ideas in a way that helps you grok something that might otherwise seem too abstract or "mathematical".	24

0	Oh geewhiz, sorry kid, must be hard trying to be all grown up  and stuff.  So hard.  How about not being such ass to people.  Note, you're my first experience with an Episcopalian. Noted.	24
0	Then on what basis do Christians discriminate against the orientation that didn't exist when Jesus was around?	24
0	If it was genetic, why would God send someone to hell over their genetics?  That's like saying anyone with brown hair is going to hell.	24
0	If it was biological, why would God disapprove of it, if he made you that way?  God doesn't make mistakes.	24
0	Same sex marriage is evil, it says so directly in the bible ( 1st Timothy chapter 1)	24

0	Homosexuality is a sin, sinners go to hell.	24
0	If it was genetic, God wouldn't call it a sin. Is having blue eyes a sin?	24
0	I said they didn't know about it.	24
0	I know, and I'm saying it's a crime that anything else exists.	24
0	The point is that if it was genetic, God made you that way, and he doesn't make mistakes.  So why would it be a sin, if he made you an alcoholic?	24
0	Of course you do, but this isn't a democracy.	24

0	This is the math I did: https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/350c7u/are_you_too_christian_to_cater_a_gay_wedding/cqzsp1o  If I got it wrong, sorry; we can disagree on numbers but the principles are what matters.	24
0	It does, and that does not matter one iota to many on this sub. They'll blame it on hundreds of years of scholarship and teaching somehow getting it wrong.	24
0	What's the difference? Does anybody ask the caterer to give the bride away? Does anyone ask the caterer to be the ringbearer? Nope.	24
0	The god of the Bible, the one with talking donkeys and bushes, killing babies, (seemingly) human emotions, contests with Satan, and sometimes even actual human form, does not appear to fit that definition.	24
0	So Jesus would have attended the wedding, but he would have admonished them for being immoral?	24
0	Can you be more specific?	24
0	So if Jesus were at a gay wedding, rather than just a gathering, he would have refused to produce any food for the guests?	24
0	My position is that your argument is not cogent.	24
0	&gt; I don't recall Jesus ever providing food or celebrating a gay wedding either.  He also never said that gay weddings should be repudiated.	24
0	That's what I'm asking you.	24
0	So if Jesus had come across a gay wedding, he would have shunned them?	24
0	/u/FiveDiabeticYordles as you are so concerned about 'your' community in /r/atheism it's surprising to see that you haven't ever posted in that sub-reddit.	24
0	If they just wanted to buy a cake, they could have bought a cake. But they wanted the bakery to cater the wedding for them, which involves actually attending the wedding. That's what the issue was about.	24
0	What do you interpret it as?	24
0	I am a Roman Catholic; [there is no such thing as a "sedevacantist"](http://dashjr.org/catholic/sedevacantism.php). I first became aware of the Holy See being vacant, about ten years ago, as I was converting to Catholicism and encountered the inevitable fact that the Faith is irreconcilable with Vatican II and its antipopes.	24
0	YEC is the truth.	24
0	Oh, fair enough. The wording is confusing.	24
0	I don't agree with OP's portrayal of the tone. That sub-reddit is hardly perfect but it's also not as one sided as claimed. Additionally complaining about something that you've demonstrated no participation in is lame if not suspect.	24
0	It's not something that people are "proposing"; it's something that some cities and states have actually tried to enforce (mostly unsuccessfully so far, fortunately).	24
0	Here have a look at this: http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/2jphv4/should_christian_ministers_and_pastors_be_forced/  All the most upvoted answers are in favour of forcing people to perform gay "marriages" against their conscience.  Doesn't matter that it was "for profit", the government still tried to force them to perform weddings that they where morally opposed to.	24
0	Oh? I'm not familiar with US law; do you have a reference for that?	24
0	So? That's the same as sex.	24
0	No I am using this as a yardstick, its a way to check if something is Christian. Its not about what we do or how outspoken we are, atheists and people from other religions should hate us just because of what we are.  Or at least thats what Jesus said .  . . If that is not happening in a community that calls itself Christian or people who call themselves Christian, then there are two possibilities :  either   1) Jesus was a liar  - or   2) They are Christian only in name	24
0	The big bang is not THE beginning according to science. They can only go back as far as the planck time. At that point it doesn't even make sense to talk about "before" the big bang since that is likely where space time "started."	24
0	&gt;Those are all the options for Orthodox.  I'm sure the Patriarch of Antioch will be thrilled to hear it.  Also, those were all Eastern Catholic jurisdictions, though there are plenty of Orthodox jurisdictions as well.	24
0	I am not advocating distrust or fear, but I am glad you hate me and see my words that way.   I am saying that the son of God came down and said his followers will be hated, and declared woe on the people who the world speaks well off.  And I am saying that what the son of God said is true.  I understand to the world this will be interpreted as a statement of war, or hate or mistrust on non-believers, but the world is an enemy of Christ, it is the world that rebelled against God and crucified his son and murdered his prophets.	24
0	well to be fair here, Christian deists such as yourself don't really believe that Christ was divine so wouldn't really consider his words here a prophecy that must come true.  You think its some kind of nice philosophy he was talking about or something.  So I donno, I wish youd post some disclaimer when explaining scripture or what Jesus said .	24
0	*Totally* agree.  There's a reason /r/Catholicism, /r/Reformed, /r/TrueChristian, etc. doesn't get these posts all the time.   Places that are faithful to the Gospel aren't adored by the resident atheists like this subreddit is.     Part of that, sure, is the size of this subreddit relative to the others.  But part of it is that this subreddit is only vaguely Christian, and not really about defending orthodox (small o) Christianity.      Basically, it comes down to, "You Christians sure aren't bad when you shut the f^%# up about the Gospel."	24
0	Or broken.  Wow.  I'm with G K Chesterton: the Fall is the only Christian dogma that is empirically proven.	24
0	&gt;  I've realized now that most denominations of Christianity don't align with my own morality, and that's fine.  Zzzzz.  Does every Tom, Dick, and Harry that decides he wants to be his own Pope and Prophet have to let us know?  The monotony...	24
0	Thank you for that. However, I would argue this somewhat differently.  I would suggest that it a "Christian" was going around beating up gay people, they wouldn't actually be Christian. Christianity is a following of Christ, and a desire to live Christlike. If someone is doing these things, and not repenting of what they've done, I would say that they simply aren't Christian, though they may claim church membership.	24
0	Nah, there's a history of it.  We have no records of any apostles refuting it.  Instead, we have a council in Acts, admonishments from Rome to other local churches that are contemporaneous to the apostles and others who would have known them, and could have easily refuted.  To be steeped in history is to cease to be a protestant.	24

0	That's your opinion, one you're entitled to have.  I do not understand your intent in posting this article.  Are you saying Hillsdale should not wish that a Supreme Court decision reflects their beliefs?  Are you outraged that a gay student received what is clearly a broadcast e-mail intended for a wide audience?  Are you participating in the author's speculation that Hillsdale would deny a degree to a gay student, something that has not happened?	24

0	Evolution (as in molecules to man) can be killed, **dead**, with two facts.  1. Life does not come from non-life. 1. There is no known process by which an organism can increase its genetic information. Natural selection reduces the genetic variation of organisms.	24
0	I see your point in the first argument, but the problem is you or i don't know if what you replied is factual. That's the problem, and exactly why i put the word intelligently in the discussion. I'd like answers from someone who knows what their talking about. (But isn't a delusionist Creationist)	24
0	Genesis describes man to come from dirt. Regardless if that was metaphorical or was originally described differently, the idea of Evolution completely dismisses that in every regard. And in some ways religion as a whole.  I'd need some pretty good convincing for me to believe God made humans Evolve from single-celled organisms and so forth.	24
0	You make some interesting points.  A friend of mine told me a interesting quote a few weeks back...  "If there were over 1,000 bricks and all the tools required to build a house all in one place, would the house build itself in 2 billion years? No, it wouldn't."	24
0	&gt; Genesis describes man to come from dirt  Food for thought... dirt contains bacteria... our cells contain bacteria... called mitochondria.	24
0	I guess that would depend on your definition of "good". It's funny, if you ask 10 people to define the word "good", you'll get 10 different answers.	24
0	Worse? Are you serious? This is how the government goes out of its way to "protect the homeless"? Furthermore, this isn't the first or only instance of this, and in some cases it goes even further.	24
0	I'll be down voted for this.   But no Jesus is not equal with the father. Jesus also doesn't know the time or the hour. Does one third of god really keep it from the other two thirds?   The father and the son are not equal at all.   Jesus had a God. Does God really worship another God?	24
0	You've mistaken me for someone interested in your opinions :)  But have a nice day!	24
0	Jesus and God seem to have a defferential relationship while Jesus is on earth. It's really hard to analogize in human terms, but while they have equal godhood, perhaps as a product of kenosis, Jesus always looks to God for instruction, guidance, and help. We have no documented cases of God doing the reverse, though perhaps Christ's whole mission of reconciliation could be conceptualized as "helping" the father with something. All this humanish talk is veering close to subordinationism or tritheism though.	24
0	... Yes, I am, would you rather be homeless and hungry or homeless and violently ill for a couple of days?   &gt;Furthermore, this isn't the first or only instance of this, and in some cases it goes even further.  Yes, and guess what, there are also instances of people *poisoning* food which they give to homeless people. I never said this was the best or a perfect solution, the government could do a lot more, but what they're doing at the minute is trying to make sure people aren't poisoning (intentionally or accidentally) homeless people.	24
0	I thought I was clear: I have **no** interest in your opinions.    Delete whatever you want: I can't stop you and I don't really care.  Have a **nice** day!	24

0	Indeed.  I *insist* you have a nice day :)	24
0	Nobody ever said the path of the Christian Hero would be an easy one, my friend.  Endeavor to persevere...	24
0	Unfortunately, a lot of atheists try and force their views upon others....even more so that some fervent Christians.  Thanks for the kind post.	24
0	Are you saying that you have the right to force someone to attend your wedding against their will?	24
0	Oh ffs, not this crap again.  Look, OP, try /r/trueatheism if you want to avoid the supposed "atheist circlejerk" you speak of.	24
0	&gt;Clearly you are not aware of mutation  Mutation removes information.  &gt; It is also clear that viruses are able to add genetic information to DNA  Which code for viruses, not anything the cell actually needs... again this destroys existing information, depending on where the insert happened.	24
0	Along with the rebuilding of the city of Babylon as the capital of a new babylonian empire, Yes.	24
0	IMO, it's because, despite the fact that being a good person doesn't matter what religion you are, but where is your moral barometer?   For non religious ppl, the end doesn't matter, so why really try to be good?	24
0	[Abiogenesis and evolution are intrinsically linked](http://www.apologeticspress.org/APContent.aspx?category=12&amp;article=1631)  &gt;there is just such a known natural process  I guess our ideas of what constitutes "information" is different. You might be able to increase the capacity, but not information.	24
0	I think it does "work". We're all created in God's image and have the capacity to love powerfully. The difference with Christ is that he unlocks God-potential, rather than mere man-potential.	24
0	Well now I'm **really** scared!  Thanks for the heads-up, chief!	24
0	well if my message is advocating for and causing hate, then so was Christs, because he said the same things almost verbaitum	24
0	Yeah we are centuries from that most likely. However the odds of the first person living to 150 or 200 already born...not that bad.	24
0	You really need to read the story and know what you are talking about.  As it is, you are not worth the time replying to.  Your stab in the dark is 100% wrong and I am starting to think you are a troll who argues just to argue.	24
0	There is a story in the OT about a foreign general who came to Israel seeking healing of his Leperousy. He was healed and converted to Judaism as a result. Part of his duties as a general involved worshipping with his king at the temples to Baal. You should look this story up.  I would say that you should design this building as well as you can. You and your boss have a unique oportunity to be representatives of God to these customers.  Be excellent.	24
0	No no, involving abortion would have the metaphor demonstrate the inability to tell between a good god and an evil god whose mortal agents are propagandists.	24
0	&gt;Mutation can add or remove information.  Does adding random components to your car's engine at random places, improve its performance, or destroy the engine ?	24
0	&gt;That sounds like a real dangerous mentality where you can only see people that don't fit your definition of christian as the "other."  2 Corinthians 6:14   Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?  &gt;This type of thinking is what perpetuates war and conflict.  MAtthew 10:34 "Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword  Yes Christianity is dangerous,	24
0	You're my **hero** :)	24
0	One flesh is more of a metaphor than literal, though its skirted on what it means that it makes a mark on the soul. Jesus was clear to the pharisees that in heaven it wouldn't matter if someone married six times on earth, because in heaven marriage doesn't exist. So the issue would be more whether they didn't have enough of a position, and so it seemed in odd bad taste than it would be likely they had too much. Though either way is speculation, I guess.	24
0	&gt; and you may end up with a better engine.  No, you wouldn't :/	24
0	It's an academic text written by a well-respected philosopher and theologian, not a pastor or blogger. The community of academic philosophy has all but eliminated the serious consideration of materialist atheism from its ranks. Their progress, however, has yet to be reflected in the general academic population which tends to run quite a few decades behind. This book is one of the new texts coming out of the academic community meant to convey that change to the general public. I was being quite serious.	24
0	Islamophobia is a form of racism.	24
0	&gt;Take out a component and put in another one. Add a fresh component. Change the material of a component.   This is not "adding random components to random places on your engine"	24
0	&gt; DNA is more like a program than an engine, the analogy is flawed.  Only because you are not considering the the cell as a complete unit.  The DNA doesn't code for everything in the cell, it "runs" on the cells hardware, and controls it. if that control process is disrupted... the cell "misbehaves", either dying, or becoming cancerous.	24
0	No, drunkard is a word that's fallen out of use which means alcoholic, and it has an accusatory tone to it. A drunkard (or a lush) is someone addicted to alcohol who makes no effort to correct it. Basically, a drunkard is that guy drinking a tall boy of Keystone on the bus, maybe going onto his second before he gets off. He smells sickeningly sweet, because when you drink to excess repeatedly, the alcohol that's been metabolized into sugar is sweated out.	24
0	Yes, Christians around the world have it harder than in America.  That doesn't justify what our country is doing.	24
0	Hillsdale has never made a secret of their views.  They have freedom of expression, and lgbt people have the freedom not to attend school there or work for them.	24
0	Nah, it's not a journal article or anything. He is definitely writing to the public. He explains himself really well. He just doesn't dumb it down.	24
0	This is Catholics and Lutherans together making a joint statement of faith, people who dont know much about Christianity often think it's just a vague collection of denominations that hate and completely disagree with each other.  This is often used to perpetuate this view that anything goes in Christianity under the false belief that there is a sect that practices just about anything.    http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_31101999_cath-luth-joint-declaration_en.html	24

0	see if I went to Jews and said,   "hey stop whining about antisemitism, have some respect for holocaust victims, those guys really suffered, looks to me like Jews are doing pretty well here"   I would be called an anti-Semite and shunned, and rightfully so.  But when Huffington post does it to Christians, it's all cool	24
0	I'm saying those gay people knew what they were getting themselves into, by going to or working for Hillsdale.	24
0	We murder about 800k babies every year, and call what is evil good, and encourage everyone to approve.	24
0	point out the difference . . . whats the difference between the antisemitic statement in my example and the anti-Christian article in huffington post.  There isnt one.  I just tl-dr everything OP said and applied it to Jews instead of Christians so people could see how offensive it is, because when its directed at Christians, everyone seems to think it 's okay.	24
0	What do you mean by a secular argument or secularism?	24
0	Humans make war, it's part of our nature.  But it is also part of our nature to justify ourselves.  It is part of Christianity to call us to fight against the evil in our nature.	24
0	It inevitably attracts and reinforces the beliefs of people who actually do irrationally hate religion. This is identical to what some churches do to their members.	24
0	What about black churches?  Are they an exception to this rule?   And I don't think Christians are really the power majority we are made out to be - we lost the evolution issue, we lost the gay marriage issue, we lost abortion, we lost just about every big issue we brought to the table, suggesting we may not be quite as powerful as people make us out to be.    Also I don't think it's fair to say that a good democarcy only protects minority religions, the orthodox church was the majority religion in Russia but it would be crazy to characterize what happened to them under communism as anything other than persecution.	24
0	True, everyone should be against it (out of simple self-interest if nothing else).  But there is strong correlation between support for abortion, liberal theology (I would include secularism in that), and liberal politics.	24
0	What about in the absolute frame of God?	24
0	Is a Christian university not a Christian university if it does not require its students to believe certain things? If so, write off most Catholic and mainline Protestant colleges.	24
0	well for one you have a major online blog publishing attack articles suggesting (rather insensitivity) that they are doing christians a favor by persecuting us.  the issue is not that Christian persecution doesn't exist, the issue is that secularists (including secularized Christians) don't see it.  And that's pretty must representative of USA isn't it, the more fundamental groups are crying persecution while secularized, lukewarm Christians and atheists dismiss it.	24
0	If your argument has no basis in who God is, or what He desires - isn't that atheism?	24
0	&gt;My ideal economic position is Distributism, but no American politician seems to have even heard of it.  Calling "distributism" an economic position is pretty inaccurate. It's basically the Catholic version of socialism except people are supposed to somehow distribute the means of production of their own volition (without government coercion), thereby protecting private property in accordance with Rerum Novarum. There's no action on behalf of the government so it's not a change that can be brought by politicians. It's just a pipe dream.	24
0	you are missing my point, if Christians were really this large and powerful majority in the US, we would be able to have the power to make others live by our rules and beliefs, we would have the political power to outlaw abortion and gay marriage and evolution, the fact that we lost and could not make you live by our rules is proof that were are not the politically powerful majority that some would like to pretend we are.	24
0	Cracker is not necessarily a derogatory term. See [Florida Cracker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_cracker).  Further: [Dirtfloorcracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qLH9qgu4PA)  ___ edit: *This* gets downvoted? lol okay guys.	24
0	It's not the fact that they bash islam that is racist. All ideologies are open to discussion or criticism. It's the very specific way they bash it that is racist. The comments on the atheist subreddit tend to focus on race rather than belief.  You never see Catholicism criticized for its followers being Italian or whatever. But you will see the word sandnigger thrown around when discussing Islam.	24

0	&gt; For humanism,I'd be pushing Sir St. Thomas More under their noses.  Why? He wasn't that critical to the orgins or development of Humanism. You have to go back millennia to ancient Greece and their teaching of "humanitas." He is an interesting exception, being a secularist, but little more. The fact that "humanism" has similarities to religion is not news either. It was intended as a rational replacement for supernatural faith based religions.	24

0	Maybe a more concrete example - we outlaw murder, because human life is valuable.  But where does that value come from?  Thin air?  If so, then that value can disappear just as easily - no?	24
0	In this world, there is only one thing that is truly immortal: cancer.  Futurists have been saying that the first person to have a 200th birthday was born in the 80's for a while now.  However, I'm not really seeing the breakthroughs necessary to make that a reality.  We've not seen anything that can reverse the tissue aging process effectively yet, and we're no closer to that technology now than we were 20 years ago.  I tend to file these claims in the same place as discussions of the Singularity: futurist hogwash.	24
0	good interpretation of the verse.	24
0	Yep.  I rather have my younger sister with a group of white guys compared to brown ones.  Racist? Probably.  I don't like that that is the case though. A few bad experiences with them sadly doesn't help. Sigh.	24

0	A leader is, by definition, someone with authority.  How much, what kind, whether they deserve it, okay sure, but they do have it.  So what if they're an anonymous Internet commenter leading a self-selected population of other anonymous internet commenters?	24
0	How does prayer have zero effect? It's one of the ways that we can communicate with God.	24
0	It's important to distinguish between atheism and materialism. There are many atheist philosophers (as has been the case for thousands of years), but most common people who are atheist are atheist because "they've never seen evidence for a god" and not because god is an intellectually false proposition. That is why I qualified my description.  There is nothing absurd about being an atheist. Materialism, as an epistemological theory, is absurd.	24

0	Constantine started this - using the uniting power of Christianity to achieve political objectives.	24
0	I don't think having my religious traditions appropriated by people who a few weeks ago openly despised them is fun but I kept my mouth shut.   It turns out we all impede someone else's fun.	24
0	But if society decides that some minority group needs to be killed to benefit the majority - we should resist that, no?	24
0	I suppose then that you oppose abortion after [7 weeks gestation?](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302?pg=2)	24
0	&gt; You're insisting that "Christian" must also be "supernatural", without showing how the two link.   You shall have no other gods before Me. You shall not make idols. You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.	24
0	Condoms and Viagra are not abortifacients.	24
0	&gt;the religious right isn’t really a religious movement. It’s a political movement that uses religion   Just like Islam.	24
0	Read before you vote. Written by a secular humanist.	24
0	well I think that depends on how you define the word Christian.  If you define it as anyone who calls themselves Christian, you would be correct.    If you define it at someone whose views are in line with any of the major denominations of Christianity you would be wrong.   By the definition popularly used here, I am a Hindu just because I selectively read and admire some Hindu works and think Vishnu is cool	24

0	It's a morality issue.	24
0	12 weeks is also more or less my cut off point.  Exceptions obviously apply, the life of the mother is always more important than the life of the unborn child and disease can obviously be a reason to abort. Where the line for that last is drawn is complicated as fuck of course.	24
0	The Religious right tends just to be the largest but it is not better than most of the others.	24
0	The "Religious Right" ought to be called the "American Ayatollahs", since it has a better descriptive power of what it is that they seek to accomplish.	24
0	God's will is better than our own.	24
0	Do you think that pro-abortion people are happy with conservative Christians?	24
0	That is the official Catholic position. The Pope spoke about it not too long ago.	24
0	...no, it's an acknowledgement that your genitals don't match and therefore you can (probably) make babies. According to the Pope.	24
0	We are talking about common people. I think someone tagged another subreddit and folks entered halfway through the conversation.	24
0	It is heterodoxy. All it would take to prove it wrong would be evidence that even a single individual would not be saved. There is so much textual evidence from all over Scripture, both OT and NT that indicate that not everyone is saved. It is simply unavoidable. To deny that is to abandon an honest reading of Scripture.	24
0	With all the political threads here lately. Here is a pdf on the way a Catholic should vote.	24
0	unless you brought it on yourself with your own poor decisions.	24
0	I would say yes.  If there is no God, then nothing matters beyond the pleasure of the moment.	24
0	Nope. Where in this post does minorityvote claim superiority?	24
0	Okay, you might want to do some research on Hillsdale.  Traditional morality is a defining feature of the Hillsdale brand.  It is a conservative Christian college.  That's why people go there.  None of this is news.	24

0	This type of christian beliefs we mock.	24
0	This entire reddit is discussing how the religious right is a corruption of the church into political activities.  So this is a discussion between Christians about Christianity on the Christianity reddit.  All are welcome to join in, but this isn't a discussion of libertarian philosophy.  We are discussing what the church should be doing.	24
0	*I will destroy you!!! Katack!*	24
0	You misunderstand entirely. This isn't Plantinga's argument. This isn't an argument for the existence of God or against evolution. It's an observation that, regardless of whether or not materialism is true (it can still be true) there is no philosophical value in believing it.	24
0	&gt; But did he actually force them to do this? Also, keep in mind not everyone is a follower of Christ.  But we are discussing the Religious Right, or more specifically the American Evangelical Christian Right.   &gt; The Republican/libertarian principles don't say you can't donate to the poor, but we shouldn't use coercion to do so.  But Jesus' position is that you *must* donate to the poor. And not just 10%, either. So even a position of 'donation is optional' is contrary to Jesus' message.	24
0	I personally feel that this country would be a lot better off without so many lawyers. maybe that makes me unreasonable too. Or perhaps I just dont like Lawyer logic.	24
0	So does that mean you can't eat anything? Since you'd be killing life? Obviously not. Shouldn't you kill in self defense then? Guess not that either.   Then you say you shall not kill human life - yet we pull the plug on respirators on the brain dead. Surely what thou shant is a person. And its the personhood that is disputed.	24
0	Observe how the GOP in Kansas has been fleecing the school system. It's absolutely **against** Christian ethics.	24

0	Sorry, I'd rather play with /u/Smile_U_On_Killa_Cam 's robots.  I can only do one favor at a time.  Maybe later.  :P	24
0	No that's not right. I wouldn't fault Muslim voters if they wanted to vote for what legal system they believe is correct. That doesn't mean I have to agree with their religious law.	24
0	And I'm sure few of them expected the college to change its views.	24
0	The constitution actually requires a majority for pretty much everything. The citizens of this town have a right to their freedom of speech as practiced by the flying of whatever flag they want. there may be more than 5% of the population of this country who dont like the stars and stripes. should we stop flying the flag for this minority?	24

0	Give me a week with the pope and the holy spirit. We'll change his mind.	24
0	The Church should be acting in such a way as to render the welfare state redundant. Unfortunately, it isn't, and until it does we can expect the welfare state to continue to exist. In the meantime though, I would like to see more Christians on the left promote voluntary charity through the Church instead of putting their effort into expanding the compulsory "charity" (which is a contradiction in terms) administered by the state.	24
0	Freedom to treat religion like a child's ramblings. Not too worried about that though, if it was actually that important to me I would have moved to Western Europe.	24
0	So erosion of personal and religious liberty is OK because we aren't being murdered in the street or thrown in jail?  Ok then. Gays should just shut up about marriage because they aren't being murdered in the street or thrown in jail.	24
0	I would expect the state to change it if the majority don't like it.	24
0	Well, it hasn't happened at Hillsdale.  They speak as everyone expects them to speak, whether or not you agree.  This is not news.	24
0	A Defense of Marriage law should be enacted to protect civil marriage from your attack on it!	24
0	I think a different term would separate it from what marriage legally is now	24
0	There's a point in appeasing voters	24
0	I sort of hold the evangelical religious right at arm's length, but it's useful to keep pit bulls around -- on a short leash.  The left does the same thing.	24
0	Anti-Adultery laws are a good thing IMHO - they reinforce the vows and contract between spouses, and protect traditional marriage - same goes with regulations on divorce. However, I think that outlawing masturbation is unenforceable and just silly.	24
0	&gt; Judicial tradition has established that this prohibits any endorsement of a religion by a government entity  And I disagree with this tradition. It is the opening of the constitution which states:  &gt;We the People of the United States...  The US is a government by the people, of the people, and for the people. being elected to office does not seperate a person from being a citizen of the US. It was once a judicial tradition that it was acceptable to segregate blacks and whites. Tradition is not always right.	24
0	Logic isn't welcome in this sub.	24
0	&gt;and by default then dissaproves of Judaism, Islam, non-flag flying Christians, and everybody else  false. approval is a whole different thing from establishment. If they flew the muslim flag during Ramadan would that mean by default that they were dissaproving of Judaism, christianity, and everybody else? No. They are simply recognizing a christian event going on in their community.	24
0	Just as long as you know there's a line that divides your right from others.   I'm sure you wouldn't support a Salafi Muslim's right to free exercise of religion by whipping unaccompanied women in the public square. That goes beyond the mere 'freedom to worship'.	24
0	&gt; and that it is not killing (or murder) to discontinue unusual aides to life (such as a respirator).  So a doctor shutting it down to kill a patient during a surgery is not committing murder? Its not killing if you are shutting off a respirator on a coma patient who might recover? Come now, you can't truly believe that.	24
0	&gt;gay marriage, which is legally forcing people to act in a Christian manner.  No, it's not allowing the government to act in an anti-Christian manner. There's a difference between allowing and supporting.	24
0	&gt;However, if there were a group of people who put out a pamphlet saying 'if a candidate is a Christian then *don't vote for him*' we'd have another Todd Starnes fueled Christian Persecution fest.   I wouldn't support that behavior from those Christians either.   Edit: clarified whose behavior I wouldn't support	24
0	Man-potential is infinitely fruitless compared to God-potential.  That would be like trying to drive somewhere far away, having never been there before, with no map, signs, directions or GPS.  Eventually, by *pure luck* one may arrive at their destination, but the odds of doing so are very slim.	24
0	No there isn't.  It's just not recognized.  Honestly, the main arguments for marriage equality rest on marriage as a tax write-off or for insurance purposes.   A flat tax and a free market would negate any sort of "advantage" marriage confers, and then we could all be free to recognize, or not, each other's marriages.    I'll interact with, love, care for, and protect a gay couple that live together with all my heart... But I will go to the guillotine before I call it marriage.	24
0	The only way to keep the planet "pristine" would be to wipe out the human race or reduce its numbers to such an extent that they could be confined to small areas to live very limited lives.	24
0	&gt;That goes beyond the mere 'freedom to worship'.   Yes, but so does things like operating a Christian business, being an openly religious candidate and explaining how you would vote based on your faith, and having the right to protest laws you believe unjust on religious grounds.  I'm referring to the above examples, not your strawman.	24
0	&gt; What do you mean by Lawyer logic?  Lawyer logic means that the letter of the law trumps common sense.	24
0	&gt; There might be a misunderstanding. The flag was not at their houses but at City Hall. That served no purpose being there.  Nope. I got that. I think city hall should be allowed to fly any flag that its citizens like, so long as it is below the american flag.	24
0	That question is probably better asked of the cake bakers and wedding photographers the article disrespected.	24
0	Because that is exactly the same as flying a silly flag.	24
0	I think a Christian should push at those boundaries till they believe the practice of their religion isn't impeded by law.	24
0	That doesn't make it an official Catholic position. I don't think you understand how Catholicism works. Not every word that comes out of the Pope's mouth is infallible. He has to be speaking ex cathedra, which he wasn't when he made that statement.  I'm not disagreeing with you on environmental issues. I'm just letting you know that you're statement about Francis making the environment an official Catholic position is completely, 100% false.	24
0	If you read earlier in the tree, I actually favor the state having nothing to do with marriage. This was an alternative I'd be fine with.   &gt;You are advocating a position where the majority can change the law at it's whim simply because it's the majority.  This is how democracy works. Majority determines the laws with some restrictions like not infringing on freedom of religion, and I don't think the state changing its terminology runs afoul of that.	24
0	The intent of the guide is good but it's really preaching to the choir.	24
0	What new information was added ?	24
0	No comedy please; we're trying to have a serious discussion.	24
0	what you suggested would be a violation of the 4th amendment against illegal seizure of property.	24
0	So you are using "Christian" in a pejorative sense.	24
0	Greed starts with the first dollar	24
0	Yes, YOUR religion.  As in, what you believe.	24
0	&gt;The state changing terminology would definitely fail the Lemon test, unless you have a compelling, nonreligious argument for it.   I disagree. But neither of us is a constitutional lawyer so I suppose we will have to agree to disagree	24
0	Good thing there is still reason on this world.	24
0	You drew a false assumption from my comment. It is because I know that the pope has the holy spirit that I know I can change his mind.	24
0	No, instead you just cluttered r/Christianity with another piece of dead horse.	24
0	That's not my religion, that's just logic applied to nature.  My religion is the belief that God gave revelation to the Jews and was born as Jesus.  Read John chapter one.	24
0	Well, when the pope says things that are wrong and defends them by hiding behind traditions that have honestly far less legitimacy than moral arguments against his position, we can honestly just assume that the holy spirit is not on his side. He's well intentioned, but that doesn't always tie to good conclusions.	24
0	*(might have)  How did the editor not catch that?	24
0	Why do you say that? Isn’t it a college? And they are considering same-sex marriage evil...Ah, I understand, you mean that same-sex marriage is a contradiction in itself right? Haha, you are right mate. Thanks for telling me.	24
0	It raises a hyperbolic and inaccurate point, and has no place in rational discussion. There is no civil right to marriage or other people's property or labor.   If there is, then we've been oppressing 1st cousins, adults who wish to marry children, and polygamous couples for just as long as we've been "oppressing" homosexuals.	24
0	So what are your opinions of the religious right, then?	24
0	If course they exist. Whether they exist or not is not particularly important. What is important is if their argument has any substance. Any support.  The religious obviously have support: their God.  What support do the gay atheists have regarding opposition to gay marriage?	24
0	So I have you down for a deflection of the point, and no refutation regarding legal or historical fact? Thanks for playing.	24
0	&gt;It has been the explicitly delineated position of the Catholic church since the 1991 Renewing the Earth document  Again, no. It has not. It still is not. The "Environmental Justice Program" isn't doctrine. It's just a program for Catholics who want to be involved in helping the environment. It is not an "official position" nor is it an "explicitly delineated position."	24
0	The difference is that no politician is against helping the poor, but there all politicians who don't respect the value of life for a fetus.	24
0	More like logic according to Aristotle who wrote about the First Mover a solid 400 years before the Gospel of John.  Later St. Thomas Aquinas formalized the proofs while he was setting up the metaphysical framework that allowed science to flourish.	24
0	I mean from the Earth. I know you believe they had an eternal destination. Where do you suppose the souls of those Canaanite toddlers ended up?	24
0	Adultery is a terrible thing to do to another person.  It should be illegal.	24
0	I doubt an NBC poll represents the majority. Let us not forget the silent majority that does make up a lot of Evangelical people. I want a Christian as president, and I won't lie about that.	24
0	How does a federal constitution apply to what a city council does?	24
0	Well and thoroughly said. Even leaving out the partial appeal to transcendent knowledge.	24
0	It is explicitly relevant to the OP. I dont see how you could fail to recognize this. I will try to put it into a more explicit context for you.  Jesus : Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. Matthew 16-28  OP : How close would you say we really are until the fated Day of Redemption?   My_Game_Account : Any day now ...	24
0	(Yeah, I see it  xDD)	24
0	"The Holy Spirit protects the Church from error." That's what I disagree with, and it's the reason Francis says what he says. It doesn't really matter how legitimate "Theology of the Body" is, since even if it wasn't they would still have to pretend it is	24
0	You're not self-righteous at all.	24
0	Well good luck with that. Hope you get better.	24
0	It depends on the context	24
0	Quotes Scripture claiming "it has nothing to do with homosexuality," and the verse says "men who practice homosexuality."	24
0	As with EVERYTHING concerning sex? the government needs to get out of the business: it has already proved its relevant utter incompetence.	24
0	Sure, show that that is a "person". Generally speaking we do not call something without a brain a person. Sure, it is the *potential* to be a person, but it is not immediately a person.	24
0	To put it simply, I don't *care* that you think I'm incorrect because you'd think that about anything I posted that suggested this teaching was fallible.  Similarly, I'm not going to put in the effort to look into where exactly the Church is in error regarding marriage, since not even the Church is willing to do so.	24
0	Religious "right"? More like religious "wrong"! Right guys!!!...guys...?...	24
0	Give me a context example, and I will try :)	24
0	Yes, states regulate divorce, but they do not outlaw it. And the anti-adultery laws are more for show than anything else. It boils down to, in my opinion, whether you think America -- which at its core is supposed to be a nation built from the secular identity -- should change its foundation to directly adopt Biblical laws.	24
0	You're missing the point: funding NASA forces people to fund others to fly into orbit. It's still using the threat of violence to get other people to do what you want. And because NASA has a near-monopoly on space flight (a total monopoly in the US until recently), people just assume that there's no better way to do it, just like they assume there can be no large-scale social safety net unless it is operated by the world's largest armed faction. Which is a strange assumption for a follower of the Prince of Peace to make.	24
0	&gt; How far do we take it? Should we outlaw divorce, adultery and masturbation?      That is a question to be worked out rather than plowed over with a "when in doubt empty your magazine".      &gt; The same people that want to prevent gay marriage also want to blow up the entire Middle East. War is far worse than some gay guys getting a piece of paper.      That isn't true.  Those are entirely unrelated issues and I doubt they have much correlation.  War is bad, but so is skewing our marriage laws away from what marriage is.	24
0	I'm exactly as interested in continuing this as I am for showing how the Bible says that women are people.  Take it up with [the mods]( http://reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/351t85/more_americans_are_comfortable_with_a_gay/cr0m4jl), not me.	24
0	The difference is we think kids swimming is generally OK as long as nothing goes wrong. Not so for sex with a lot of us	24
0	&gt; As with EVERYTHING ~~concerning sex~~? the government needs to get out of the business entirely: it has already proved its relevant utter incompetence.  FTFY n_n	24
0	Well, education is not a one size fits all in any area of life.  What is appropriate will depend on the context of the situation.  For example, the age.  What you teach a 2 year old about sex will be different to what you teach a 12 year old.  It will also depend on who is doing the teaching (for example a school teacher, a parent, etc).  There is also the maturity of the person you are talking to.  I'll give you a specific example.  I have two kids of my own, they are both prepubescent.  You bet I am giving them abstinence only sex education in their current context.	24
0	Individual states were most certainly built on their religious identity, and have legislated moral issues since the time of their founding.	24
0	What keeps you from committing suicide?	24
0	Yeah, I'm not sure I'd characterize myself as that.	24
0	I'm not an American, and I didn't go to a public highschool, so I don't know enough about the context to have an informed opinion.  I can say that I wouldn't think it would be appropriate for an Australian highschool.	24
0	Oh... :( Whoops.  You guys always seem so cordial with each other... I guess you two know how to keep from airing your dirty laundry to the public.  I'm glad that things are looking up for you two then? [seeing as how you're now responding to each other].  Before you mentioned this, I wouldn't have imagined you two getting in a spat on much besides... hm... mathematical platonism?  But don't take that as me trying to get into your family business; although, I am curious if that was what you were disagreeing about (if this "huge fight" wasn't imaginary, of course).	24
0	Well if I were you, I wouldn't either; considering that would make me [you] seem like an egotistical douchebag tooting his own horn.  But it's okay to accept a compliment when someone gives it to you, atnorman. No need to be self-debasing when it isn't necessary- but the humility is appreciated.  On a side note- I don't know if I've ever told you this, but I always thought your name was something like, "atnor-man," like my name is, "marthman."  Come to find out your name is a play on a twitter-handle, @norman... my world was rocked.	24
0	&gt; Because that would necessarily change the essence of who He is.  No it wouldn't. There is no male or female in Christ	24
0	But the problem with that assumption is that it is not compatible with Paul's theology elsewhere.  So either he had a change of mind, didn't really think things through, or something else.  Given that he states in one epistle "I speak as a fool" there's reason to suspect he's not always entirely straight-forward.	24
0	How am I advocating the state meddling?	24
0	I honestly didn't want to ask this question, believe me. I tried hard to convince myself not to do it.  But "Can't wait, actually" and "Going to be sweet".  I literally could not resist.	24
0	What would those higher taxes be used for? Failed programs.	24
0	&gt; Come to find out your name is a play on a twitter-handle, @norman... my world was rocked.  It's neither. It's my first two initials and my last name.	24
0	Ah, but now it's a race to see whether I correctly understand it before I correctly understand Orthodox theology. They tend to be arrogant jackasses less often, though, so it's not looking good for the Original Church here :(	24
0	And my world is rocked once again!  Your first name wouldn't happen to be Alan, would it?	24
0	If you're referring to ancient Jewish mythology, then you're right.  There are serious flaws in the Creation story, which can be reconciled with today's scholarship, but they still are lacking in full explanations for the stories presented in the Hebrew scriptures.  Mankind has to stop for a moment, acknowledge God, and submit to the fact that we do not know everything, and God has left some things mysterious.  We have been given all the divine revelations we need, but in our arrogance, we refuse separate the absurd from the truth, but instead, we continue on, trying to reconcile false notions.  Acknowledgement of God is where life begins.	24
0	Oh, you change of opinion quickly uh? Also, its not cool to go around calling people things :(	24
0	&gt; But at the same time, it would be really nice to die today.  Leaving your wife and son to suffer because you died?	24
0	What about it would be even slightly unfounded?	24
0	It has my full support.  Though I should say that it must include a thorough description of our sexual faculties and their function.  There should also be lessons on the roles and responsibilities of parents as well as resources and information on marriage.      The only alternative I can think of is one that condones fornication, contraception, and other grave moral evils.  Children are good and loving them makes us more human.  The corruption of sex does the opposite.	24
0	1st Timothy talks about forbidding marriage and Hebrews extols marriage (ofc, Paul's authorship of Hebrews is debateable, but even if he didn't write it, I know of no reason to assume that it was written by someone who would disagree with Paul).  The tone and the message are entirely different than with the Corinthian epistles, I assume, because in one he is writing to a brother in the faith and a student of his, and in the others, he is wary of adversaries in the faith.	24
0	Women aren't equal to men, duh	24
0	&gt;How leaving your son and wife to suffer and struggle without you isn't said?   Not really because I'll be in union with God and understand why He did that. Also being able to engage in perfect worship of God is going to be amazing.	24
0	Indoctrinated is the correct term for what youre describing. It doesnt mean brain-washing. If my muslim neighbor raised his kids to follow the doctribe of his religion, that would be indoctrination. An other example of the term is the army's "tradoc" which stands for training and doctrine. Its just trleaching peolle a mindset that they may or may not agree with.	24
0	No, too many resources for that; public stocks would be better.	24
0	It's not a war on Christianity. It's a war on faith. They aren't really attacking Christ. They are removing the notion of God. If there is no God, there is no need for a Christ, Muhammad, Buddha, etc, etc, etc. If there is no God, what do we need redeeming from? We don't. Just trust your elected leaders and Governement!....../puke	24
0	Why do our children need to be taught about poisoning their body?  If you have a class about "tips and tricks for huffing gasoline", you could expect it to happen more often.	24
0	How do those conflict?	24
0	But the amount of time that you spend on Earth is determined by YOU. By what kind of life you live, whether you smoke, do drugs, eat healthy, exercise, etc.   You can't just lay back and, no matter what kind of life you lead say, well, whenever I die, it will be God's will.   And, consequently, by such logic, justifying leaving your wife and son alone.     That's outright selfish.	24
0	&gt;So I guess you're for killing homosexuals, adulterers, disobedient children, anyone who has a different religion (including different denominations) then.  Not really, because Jesus was killed in their place.	24
0	That is so completely not the point.	24
0	You said yes to my question. But then the following statement contradicts that.	24
0	Are you implying that people engaging in risky behaviors wish to die?	24
0	They are addressed and such a choice is immoral.  Marriage is signing up for children.  Being willfully childfree is telling a lie.	24
0	Sorry, but I don't consider worship/prayer a "break."  It's *work.*	24
0	The answer you are looking for is "there is no new information,  only old information repeated"	24
0	In 1st Timothy 4, he talks about people who depart from the faith, forbidding marriage, etc.  In Galatians, he talks about false brethren who have infiltrated some church or churches.  In 1st Corinthians there is already scandal, judgment, accusations, etc, and that is where he gives the impression that marriage is a concession, though he never denounces it as evil, and explicitly says it is not sin.  One has to do a bit of guesswork to reconstruct the situation in the early Church, and, at this point I'm guessing that the cultural influence of Gentile virginity cults, and/or Hellenized Judaism could have something to do with it.	24
0	Yes, if only to award damages in the event of a divorce. People are fined over much less (not wearing a seat-belt for example), so I'm OK with a fine as well.	24
0	But if you can't wait to die, what makes you go to the doctor's to undergo regular health checks?	24
0	I believe that states have historical precedence to prevent a married couple from swinging, polygamy, or other non-traditional actions within marriage.	24
0	The Church in America.	24
0	Isn't Christianity an authoritarian regime?	24
0	&gt;Explain your reasoning because it just sounds like idiotic rambling at the moment.  Homosexuality, murder, theft, incest, and bestiality are all outlawed in the bible... if you reject the idea that homosexuality is wrong, why do you accept that the rest are indeed wrong?	24
0	It's an Evangelical Free church. They have no such prohibitions.   Symbols are important, as an Orthodox would understand. If a person or community has only one symbol, that symbol says a lot about them. And a lack of symbols is symbolic in its own right. So I have to wonder—what thought processes led whoever was in charge of decorating the church building to think that an American flag and "patriotic" Ten Commandments poster were sufficient to represent a Christian community? And why didn't someone else say, "Hey, how about a cross somewhere?"	24
0	I don't assume that Paul was conflicted or that he contradicted himself.  I think he was flatly pro-marriage, not intending to reject the older, Semitic traditions of his ancestors, and that the idea that he intended to exalt celibacy as morally superior to marriage, is a misunderstanding of Paul and the complex situation that the early church was in.	24
0	It's a "we're right because we're right because we're right" system. I know I pull this out a lot but there are concrete reasons I left the Church and that is a big one.	24
0	This bias in this sub never ceases to amaze me.     Right Wing is bad - 200+ upvoted   Left Wing is bad - 0 (38%) upvoted	24
0	Is that sort of intimacy only achievable via sex?	24
0	The point of the CDF document (I do suggest you read it, it is a good read) is that civil law must be in harmony with right reason.  It was written under the oversight of the future Pope Benedict XVI and approved by St. John Paul II, so I suggest you read it.	24
0	&gt; Alimony, division of assets, child support, etc  Those are not fines, and there's nothing theocratic about breach of contract.	24
0	Seems irresponsible of the pope if he has the power to make certain statements which if he makes them the right way they're infallible to only do so like one every few hundred years. You'd think he'd make one every five minutes in order to solve pretty much every issue he could in record time.	24
0	I can't just ignore Christians who put America on a pedestal over Christ. I've seen the harm it does firsthand.	24
0	I'm about as anti-statist as you can get, but I don't understand the interpretation you favor. The authorities Romans 13 refers to bear the sword. What kind of Church authorities bear the sword?	24
0	&gt; infallible statements regarding faith and morals  Yeah those. I disagree with 'em	24
0	Oh look another 'Conservatives are bad' thread.	24
0	&gt; It's not a coincidence that we evolved to want to do that.  But it *is* a coincidence that other people evolved to *not* want to do that?  Can't have it both ways	24
0	&gt; Oh, you change of opinion quickly uh?  Not really. That's why I'm still a part of the denomination I was born into	24
0	Government interest is to have a working law system based on a legislator. They just didn't think it was in government interest because in their personal opinions it wasn't what they wanted.	24
0	What rule(s)? I just went over them and I don't see where I've violated any.	24
0	In my opinion, sex ed should be the responsibility if the parents. My wife has and will be  continuing to teach my daughter a lot of aspects of human  reproduction including ways to prevent it.   Abstinence is still the only method that is 100% guaranteed effective when used. Being realists, we'll teach her other methods that are pretty effective. I don't consider the pull and pray to be a good alternate.	24
0	Are you implying that Jesus doesn't share sexual moments with the church?	24
0	It sounds like you are the one with hate. Those who watch Fox News are deceived and incapable of rational thought according to you. You even say he is being poisoned? It's fine to disagree with Fox News. But you seem to really hate them.	24
0	I simply don't see how it's possible.	24
0	Everything's possible if you believe.  I was at a wedding once where a priest said that you should imagine your spouse like they're Jesus at all times, and he even got strangely sexual with the metaphor. And this was for both sexes, he did it separately.	24
0	&gt; If it will end this stupid debate and it lets everyone have the same rights as everyone else, yes.  That's all SSM advocates ask.   And it's one thing to not be married and call your partner your husband, but another thing entirely when legal issues come into play.	24
0	Just remember to not be so hateful.	24
0	how about [Book Of The Month Club](http://www.literaryguild.com/welcome/)? since he's into fiction anyway  \* wow, people really hate book of the month club around here	24
0	No idea what ship you're talking about. This sub is overwhelmingly liberal.	24
0	I'm simply terrified when I hear about a person who has a wife and a son and who claims that he can't wait to die.	24
0	This is partially true. But let it not provide us any excuses in regards to sin.	24
0	More info    http://campusreform.org/?ID=6490	24
0	&gt; There is also the infrequent reckless bus driver who may catch you.  Aren't such situations predetermined by God?	24
0	But I have no fear of death at all.   I've just noticed that my lack of fear of death have different basis than his lack of fear of death.  I'm simply trying to establish what the underlying difference is.	24
0	Which is wrong, and very very bad, also agaisnt freedom of speech, and religion	24
0	&gt; So who determines that exact day and hour?  Who does?	24
0	One could argue that God is a result of human wisdom and effort as well.	24
0	But you're still fine with the government making people hand over assets at gunpoint though, right?	24
0	Yeah i was trying to be nice. Children trust their parents to keep them alive. Thats when parents indoctrinate them.	24
0	i never thought of this valid point.	24
0	But who first thought of the idea of God?	24
0	So my mother getting cancer was predetermined by God?	24
0	Can you say why in your own words?	24
0	It's in the title because it's literally the same story as the movie. That's how ridiculous this is.	24
0	C'mon, cant we take a break?	24
0	Right, but that has to do with what "nature" means.	24
0	Probably not, remember where you are.	24
0	I've never seen the movie so I don't get the reference.	24
0	Wait, religious apologetics?  (edit)   Btw, the downvote button is not a measure of right and wrong. One can be right and still be downvoted by those it upsets.	24
0	&gt;Marriage throughout history has been anything from a business deal,  I doubt for the majority of people except potentially for landed gentry and the upcoming bourgeoisie, I'd agree with you.  &gt;to a way to broker peace between two factions,  Once again, for a certain class such as the aristocracy or royalty definitely. For poor farmers, not really.  &gt;to an ultimate expression for love to each other.   Somewhat I guess.  &gt;With the exclusion of the Egyptians, marriage for love is fairly recent in terms of human history.  What does love have to do with what a marriage is?	24
0	well, he can say he's a woman but that don't make him one right? This only makes souls to not even consider Christianity when searching God, and so they search answers on Buddhism or another religions.	24
0	It is the left that made this necessary.   Their model is that first almost everything should be legal.  Second, the consequent costs should be borne by everyone.   Finally,  everyone must be forced to accept this.    And good for the religious right.   I don't think being a gay married needle shooting heroin user should be illegal, but I don't want to pay for the results, nor should the slimy left be able to force me to associate with people like this if I don't want to.   The right is often dumb and oversteps, but the left is flatly evil.  I welcome any ally that can help thwart them.	24
0	Fines like that don't generally come down to gunpoint. If you don't pay a court-ordered fine, the government will most likely garnish your wages.	24
0	Just another sign of the times.	24
0	I believe it too. Calling people names is obnoxious and rude. Typical Atheist Behavior.	24
0	It sounds like you're being sarcastic, but I'm really not sure why. Religious apologetics constantly get beat down and debunked. Stand in the shoes of an atheist for a day and you'll see just how easily religious apologists get shredded.  Getting an M.A. in apologetics is like getting a doctorate in dial up 14k modem repair, or like Sony cassette Walkman specialist.   Ok I guess, but you'll quickly find yourself without a job and a mountain of school debt.	24
0	I asked myself that same question. I have heard that the bible is speaking of the church as a metaphor meaning all those who believe. But then there are also those who say the bible is to taken literally, word for word, and that it's talking about the actual Church and those in it. I have heard it said by a group of atheists that 'The Church' in the bible is The Catholic Church and that Paul was the first pontiff.   I guess it's all in what you believe, but you bring up a very good question friend. God Bless you.	24
0	The threat of force is still implied	24
0	Because God forbid womyn^TM use teh inatwebs, amirite?	24
0	&gt;Most commoners back in the day were farmers. Marriage as a business deal combined two families resources, they probably did it alot.  You're speculating a lot more than I'm willing too, I am suspicious of your claim that most commoners owned farms.  &gt;In addition, you seem to be against divorce. You would have two people who dont love each other stay married?  Love is a choice and an action not an emotion. I choose to love my wife daily.	24
0	The term has long been understood in the East (where the Greek original of the NT originated) to mean sex acts between men.  "Homosexuality" may not be as precise a term as "αρσενοκοιταις" but for conveying the meaning and the sense, adequate.  Example in the classic [Rudder](http://www.holytrinitymission.org/books/english/canons_fathers_rudder.htm), canon 18 of St. John the Faster.  Search the text for "arseno" which should locate the various transcriptions of αρσενοκοιταις.	24

0	The ten commandments - America's moral foundation.	24
0	Yes but natural law doesn't contradict homosexuality it supports it. There are *many* animals that have societal structures involving or based on bisexual or homosexual intercourse. It is very natural, you'd be better off making the argument that it is a desire of the flesh, not an abomination of nature when trying to demonize it. (Not that you personally are, just in general)	24
0	"Born into" a religious belief. Ah that explains why you haven't studied much. You just believe everything mommy and daddy taught like how all Catholics are evil and eat babies?	24
0	I'm not a fan of that theory, I feel there is stronger proof. There are many social systems of various animals were homosexuality as bisexuality are part of their life. It's quite interesting to see them all.	24
0	Part of that integrity is talking it out, but that's up to you.	24
0	That was one act to keep his followers from starving. He then got upset when they followed him simply for the food. I doubt we can draw this conclusion so easily.	24
0	I didn't say it.	24
0	There are many more children living in poverty who were born when their parents were in their 20s than when their parents were teenagers.   http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/09/marriage-americas-greatest-weapon-against-child-poverty  And I would dispute what you say. Teen pregancy used to be more common historically, and they raised their children correctly because young people were much more mature.	24
0	Just as a question out of curiosity, have you ever seen an apologist get shredded in a debate?	24
0	&gt;just as other Christians can use personal interpretations and cherry picked verses from the bible to judge and condemn you.  You know what's funny? I've never had another Christian tell me I'm a fake Christian because of what I believe. I've never had that problem. It's almost as if the dichotomy isn't as stable as you believe it to be. I've had Christians *disagree* with me, but to call me a fake? Never had that problem.  I wonder why that is.	24
0	Exceptions, not the rule. One type of relationship is inherently geared towards family life and it isn't a homosexual union.	24
0	Right, but America is part of Earth and dinosaurs were unintelligent animals, not a developed race.	24
0	If the sex of the spouses is what matters in the debate, only male and female relationship can produce a child	24
0	&gt;They shouldn't, they only will if they let themselves  Isnt that like saying, "If you try really hard, you can like this food you dont really like under the best of circumstances."?	24
0	Teenagers still aren't the main issue when it comes to child poverty.	24
0	No you are spot on.  The word "Biblical" has absolutely no meaning. It's just a word that means "me right you wrong."  I got the "I'll pray for you / Fuck you" after I went all angry socrates on a dispensationalist who seemed confused about the burden of proof a few weeks back in this same message board.	24

Necessarily possibly procreative, which can only happen with a male and a female.	24

0	You defend them. You promote them. You say it's moral. That is on you and it is an attack. It is that simple.   If you want to morally use the rosary, you shouldn't do those things. If you don't I do think it's a spiritual problem. I'm sorry your suffering and you have my prayers as you have always had, but I do indeed experience it as an attack followed by a usurpation.	24
0	The medical condition of a person wanting to be married is not what's on trial. Their sex (I.e. male or female, not the sexual act) is.	24
0	Well, now there isn't, at least with respect to the particular segment of that particular faith that has internalized the meaning of those particular quotes.   For most of history, and indeed currently in many (if not most) Christian denominations; all of that above is heresy.	24
0	The doctrines we're discussing.	24
0	Under what circumstances does apostolic succession invalidate? Newman's "_securus judicat orbis terrarum_" may have convinced the mind of someone for whom _orbis terrarum_ was Western Europe (completely ignoring the Eastern Orthodox, incidentally), in a time when that world did _judicat_ heavily towards Roman legitimacy. But today that claim seems tenuous, and both today and then, the Eastern churches seem to have an excellent claim that Rome, not them, has been in schism for a millennium. (And schismatics can definitely have apostolic succession, unless you acknowledge that both the Eastern churches and the Anglican one aren't schismatic....)	24
0	It is on that presumption that the faith of every Protestant and every Eastern Orthodox rests, and when a billion people have that presumption, it's not really that presumptuous, no. (It's equally presumptuous, I'd say, for the Pope to assume that all these other people are abandoned by the Spirit, which he sorta has to maintain unless he wants to admit that _Unam sanctam_ was incorrect.)	24
0	I don't know but some butt-hurt Buddhist is following me around questioning my posts.

0	No need or no point for that. Heterosexual marriage in law would ensure children are legally bound to their mother and father.	24
0	Procreative capacity is only found in a heterosexual union. Heterosexual marriage binds children to their mothers and fathers. Homosexual marriage ensures the opposite.	24
0	Then don't. That's up to you. I certainly understand. But you do remain in my prayers, if that's a consolation.	24
0	That is your opinion. Not a fact that said politician doesn't care about poor people.	24
0	&gt;Hatred, racism, murder, lying  Not necessarily, dont raise a child with any hatred towards anyone,  and they are unlikely to hate anybody barring some extreme circumstance.	24
0	That isn't contraception.  Seems like you would have known that by now.  You aren't exactly new.  Are you just screwing with people and making a show for the ignorant?	24
0	But that's boring!  :P	24
0	No it is not a fact that poor people are hurt by conservative principles. That is your opinion.	24
0	The bible clearly lines out grounds for divorce. Remarriage to a new spouse gets me.	24
0	Divorce perpetrators don't care about forgiveness.	24
0	What's the other alternative?	24
0	There is no such thing as safe sex.  Are you trying to refer to contraception?	24
0	It SHOULD. Academically - like you might with a class on zoology.  NOT as a shop class in How To.  How To *is* for parents. It is a shameful failure of our society that we can even think otherwise.	24
0	Yeah well, I AM a teenager, and I will tell you right now that we have sex on the brain 24/7. Were like zombies who eat all your food and play video games, while being fueled by that burning furnace of horniness.	24
0	Anathewhat?  Point me to the council that suggested a disruptive scientific advance - any advance - based on revelation.	24
0	Having achieved both: no. But my words did not insinuate equivalence. I said "it's enough". You don't need a medical degree to teach about sex.  AND WHERE DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL TO HAVE AN MD TEACHING YOUR HEALTH CLASS?! haha.	24
0	i feel like im being punked right now. is this ashton?	24
0	I didn't say he couldn't, I said he shouldn't and that I found the public nature of it offensive.	24
0	Straight up I see no problem, so feel free to take a crack at it.	24
0	Expecting you to stand by your vows, is not "screwing" you.	24
0	But the contract *isn't* dissolved, nor can it be.	24
0	You could refuse to sign, perhaps. But that in-between state of separation is one I wish upon no one.	24
0	Nah, the only strong opinion they have toward you guys is that celibacy is creepy and wrong and leads to child abuse, and I completely disagree there	24
0	Has anyone really been far as decided to use even go want to do look more like?	24
0	I'm not in Public Health, but I've read. The difference between *school* and *family* is: academic. School is NOT a place to learn how to sex. Only that it's a biological fact. Parents MUST be involved. Viscerally.	24
0	Then THAT is the way forward: educate the parents in How To -- with the intention that they communicate with their kids.	24
0	That's not what it says.	24
0	The indoctrination of young mushmelons is the issue. If the state should *stay out of the bedroom*? then it should actually *stay out*.  But since a compelling interest in Public Health overrides? then by involving the parents? each family can maintain its own culture AND be healthier.	24
0	&gt;Emotionally/psychologically it's relatively unhealthy behavior that will likely cause you and your family to stagnate in your emotional growth.  Hm I had no idea other people's tongues in your mouth were a key ingredient in emotional growth	24
0	Mm. It NEEDS to be part of *home life*. Or this society has failed in a fundamental way.	24
0	If you want to live the most unsexual, hateful lifestyle possible as so the Duggars do.. Go for it ;)	24
0	So since I'm an atheist and my wife is a Buddhist, we are "married" but if we were christians we'd be married. Yeah, ok. And to insinuate that all christian marriages last forever is laughable. You were right about one thing, love is a powerful emotion, but I don't need an invisible man to tell me that. The joy of seeing my wife smile everyday does that.	24
0	Yes, but in the Mosaic law, adultery was punishable by death.   Polyandry would only be illegal from a Biblical standpoint. From the standpoint of a secular society, it would make no difference if it is illegal or not.  The Biblical definition of marriage is a covenant between one man and one woman. It only doesn't specify that a man can make more than one covenant with other women. It's not a group marriage in that sense. It's more like a series of marriages. The woman is not allowed to enter into other covenants with other men, because that is adultery, which is prohibited in the Mosaic law.	24
0	Well, it needs to be illustrated in court that God has personally incurred injurious effect in some manner due to actions of homosexuals. No injury then no cause for suing for damages. (Am presuming is some manner of civil suit given a lack of criminal code violations being cited in the article.)	24
0	For beliefs, I think I'd be drafted by the Secular Humanists because even though I don't identify as one, I happen to think and do pretty much 100% of what Secular Humanism does.      The Automobile Old Order Mennonites would draft me for my works, because I'm a pretty good auto mechanic and all-around fixer of things. (Edit: And because I know enough German to communicate.)	24
0	yikes dude... nothing is on the otherside by the way, not even blackness. It will literally be nothing, like the time before you were born	24
0	Woah you're a pagan now?	24
0	I'm not a fan of farming this out. Parents are the procreators, they should guide their progeny. Taking this *responsability* from them, into a collective that already fails to accomplush its more limited mission? is a shameful mistake.	24
0	I never understood this. I'm the most comfortable with a candidate with a good track record in their current office, a degree of tolerance for other beliefs, and a demonstrated understanding of how economy, defense and politics work. Their private beliefs and sexuality are their own private thing as long as they're legal.  But trust HuffPost to spew polarizing bullshit.	24
0	And with that pun apropos? what more can be said of premature sex? "*fucking ridiculous*".	24
0	Wow, you must be terrified of death. I'm so sorry to hear you believe that's true.	24
0	Islam is not a race, it's a religion and like all religions they are founded upon superstition. Unfortunately the worst manifestation of religion right now tends to be linked to extremist Islam.	24
0	The struggles of one's past ***can*** give one strength, but not necessarily. It can also eat away at you, tearing you apart from the inside out. But not necessarily.  Frankly, it depends on what the struggles were and what teachings and support systems (if any) you were exposed to before, during, and after those struggles.	24
0	At this point, believing Christians are a pretty significant minority in the US. That's something we'll have to adapt to. I'd rather vote for an atheist who believes in robust protections for religious freedom than a Christian who doesn't.	24
0	Don't take much note of it. My faith waivers, and not because of Christianity -- Christianity is the only reason as to why I would have faith -- but because of this abstraction of a God. I have always found it difficult to reconcile myself with the idea of a God, although what kept me going as long as it did was Christianity. I still believe that Christianity, and the philosophy, theology, and ethics that stems from it, are *generally* the ideal principles -- of which are also substantiated through Christian narrative.   TL;DR: I'm agnostic atheist, but a strong proponent for Christian philosophy, theology, and ethics.	24
0	This may be inappropriate, but is your uncle married to your aunt? That doesn't seem very normal.	24
0	That's the opposite of safe.  That's like saying a rifle is 95% accurate or a cancer is 95% lethal.  Contraception is opposed to health.	24
0	Huffing gas is a cheap way to sabotage the brain for fun.  Contraceptives are a cheap way to sabotage the sexual organs for fun.  So you're admitting to putting on a show?	24
0	The most inclusive choice would be to allow parents to teach their kids contraception in the privacy of their own home.	24
0	&gt; Lots of talk, little evidence.  If that truly bothers you, offer counter evidence of your own.	24
0	You seem to think that "free will" means total control over one's actions. What if a person had the free will to choose to be an instrument of a divine hand? I assure you that there are plenty of people that would do so, given the opportunity. One of the hallmarks of a true Christian is to put God's will above their own. There is free will in that decision, just like one has free will to join the military. Yet, once you're in there, you follow your orders, and you do what is assigned to you.	24
0	This current attempt at revisionist history about the Crusades is amusing and ignores the multiple factors, political, economic, territorial, etc that were occurring.  As always when it comes to war, religion was a rationalization used by the various parties for their own ends, not the cause.	24
0	As I have stated elsewhere in this thread, flying a flag is not the same thing as establishing a particular religion.	24
0	What if God came down to every planet with life on it and died for them. What if every planet had ALIEN JESUS.  THAT WOULD BE THE SICKEST THING EVER.  Also what if there was a planet out there where their Adam and Eve didn't fuck up and they're all still living in paradise.	24
0	I see alot of christians equate Paul's words with him-  he wasnt God, so I dont see why they should.  same with revelations, if Jesus had said it, it could possibly hold more weight	24
0	It's hilarious yet sad	24
0	There is no constitutional amendment that states "Congress shall make no law establishing a national dessert". A day of prayer endorsed by the government is inherently a violation of the first amendment. Pray all you wish, but keep the government out of it.	24
0	How do you know that those two are the same?  Is there a chart?	24
0	All right, I can definitely understand that chain of thought leading you to Orthodoxy. Newman almost led me there. :)	24
0	That kind of speech isn't protected when it's by people acting as government officials.	24
0	&gt; If two people want to be in a relationship that they call a marriage but other people don't, do you think either of them really care what someone else calls it?   As long as the state recognizes it as a marriage, I agree, they couldn't care less what some people think.	24
0	It harms your neighbour atheists. That should be enough.	24
0	endorsement also does not equal establishment and thus it is legal.	24
0	I think the truth is that Muslims started it and atrocities were committed by both sides.	24
0	When you say you believe the Bible is accurate (I'll take that to mean entirely divinely inspired and inerrant) then you've admitted to your own gullibility. Is clear your research has been of a shallow nature.	24
0	How funds are raised and where they are directed are opinion choices made by the voting majority. These choices further social causes and influence the public's morality. If you think voting to enforce your personal opinion on another is appropriate, you lose all authority to criticize people who vote against gay marriage (outside of saying that their Biblical interpretation is wrong, which I don't think it is).	24
0	I have done enormous amount of work in hospitals and hospices where I directly observed those praying for healing of their loved ones.  Even when they didn't get the healing they wanted, almost all of them were left in a better and more peaceful place for the prayers they made.  I am also a parent and a grandparent and a great grandparent.  My offspring have often and most urgently requested things that appeared good to them.  They often got very angry and even said, "what is the use of asking" when I declined to give them what they asked.  They couldn't see the greater good that caused me not to give the answer they wanted.	24
0	The same way as if there was a "Muslim holiday"  day. Its maybe a little difficult for you to understand because you are religious, but for me, government sanctioning religion is sort of an attack on the faithless.   Do you want a day of "Scientology holiday"? Its the same sort of thing.	24
0	The court has revised its rulings before. When you are acting as a government official, you are representing the People, not your faith.	24
0	When people act on behalf of the government, they face different restrictions than regular citizens, including for their speech. I'm sorry you don't like my opinion.	24
0	&gt; even though you don't like them  I'm sure you meant "it", not "them", right?	24
0	Hateful? Really? Come on now, always so quick to pull out the victim card. What I wrote is merely an eye roll in text. What IS insulting, is inferring that my marriage to the woman I love is not real by putting quotes around it, only because we believe differently than you all do. That's bigotry, that's hateful.	24
0	Relevant, but not determinate.	24
0	Worth a read, sure, but if God's M.O is to transmute evil into good, but that it's impossible for us to see it, it's just as valid as saying that it is leprechauns who transmute evil into good. There's no way for us to know whether or not it's true.	24
0	I never said that.	24
0	Ive shown three passages from different books all that say one thing: if you remarry (while your first spouse lives), its adultery. 3.	24
0	No, it's not. It's the truth. Invisible =/= non-existent. You're reading into it what's not there.	24
0	&gt; The Crusaders were to unconditionally surrender and could leave by paying a ransom of **ten dinars for men, five for women and two for a child and those who couldn't pay would be enslaved**. Balian then pointed out to him that there were **20,000** of those in the city who could never pay such a sum.  The soldier garrison certainly was not 20,000 strong. That's the population of the city.	24
0	Being a government official doesn't mean you give up your right to freedom of speech. Not in private, and not in public.	24
0	Can you clarify what you mean by that?	24
0	Awwww... You mean the Freedom From Religion Foundation can't force their god-less views on us all??? So sad...	24
0	Reflect and contemplate all you want.	24
0	The East has never had to deal with translation issues because Greek is the native tongue of the Orthodox Church.  It has long been clear to us that the verse and others like it refer to sex acts between men.  Furthermore, the Orthodox Church (including Rome at the time) is the one that compiled the canon of Scripture based on consistency with our pre-existing faith.	24
0	So If God has always existed it is reasonable to assume that he has created an infinite number of beings.	24
0	I asked about a personal opinion not a conclusive answer.	24
0	What I mean is whether he created anything before that?	24
0	But what do YOU think?	24
0	&gt; Overall, the Day of Prayer is just divisive  Well, I wonder what group is making it divisive? It surely isn't the religious.	24
0	It's not really worth talking about leprechaunicy if if you're not willing to grant the premise that leprechauns exists for the conversation.  You kind of flat-out asserted that leprechauns don't exist. Besides, we *can* talk about theodicy without necessarily granting the premise that God does exist, we can talk about how a world would look like if a god did exist and compare it with ours.	24
0	"atheism" isn't a religion. It's not a thing. It's a lack of something. The government absolutely does not sanction such things, and even if it did, I wouldn't have a problem with that, not because I am atheist, but because atheism can't be use as a tool of propaganda to brainwash people with. Religion can.	24
0	&gt; But I think it is not right for the government to sanction a day of prayer. The government should have nothing todo with religion whatsoever. It isn't right.  I think it is lawful for the government to sanction a day of prayer. So who's the right one here?	24
0	&gt;Also, the love between husband and wife derives and is sourced from Jesus' love  Did this apply before Jesus' birth?	24
0	I'm just curious what God had been doing during his infinite existence preceding the creation of mankind.	24
0	Hit up [Genesis 1]. It answers your question.	24
0	1)  How are the gospels corrupted?  By whom?  For what purpose?  2)  Jesus claimed divinity several times, and this argument is so tired.  "I and the father are one" is really clear, isn't it?  The entire John 17 prayer makes zero sense if Jesus wasn't divine.  3)  What evidence do they have that Christ wasn't crucified, other than "we don't think He was"?	24
0	Can you point to a specific verse that answers my question and elaborate on it?	24
0	It's not its place to do so? What law infers that?	24
0	Absolutely.  They are free outside, and they are free inside, and they are free to pray to open Congress, and when we start a football game.  That is what free speech means.  Personally, I had my sons not join the school prayer.  But I don't mind those who do want to pray.  There is a term for being so absorbed in your own feelings that you cannot be considerate of the feelings of others: "narcissism".  You might want to look it up.	24
0	But it does not answer my question. It starts with  &gt;  In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.   What does the word "begging" refer to? Certainly not the beginning of God.  In my view, it refers to the beginning of the world as we know it.  My question is whether God created any worlds beyond the world that we know.    Therefore I do not see how Genesis 1 is relevant here.  Unless you can substantiate its relevance of course.	24
0	&gt;Maybe my idea of E Pluribus Unum is more like a buffet where lots of cultures are represented  That's the opposite of what it means. "One from many" not "Many from One." Cultural pluralism causes nothing but division and chaos.	24
0	OK. The crusaders should have attacked the Muslims who started it.	24
0	Well let's not get carried away into too much fuzziness.   Just because there are a few edits (which could just mean dictations) doesn't mean we can't know anything about authorship.  We don't completely dissolve into relativism.  Luke still investigated eyewitnesses to write his gospel.  Matthew still wrote intentionally for Jewish audiences.  And, by the way, the evidence for the reliability of the gospel accounts is FAR tighter than any evidence for the Koran being divine.  Mohammed went into a cave and came out with a text from God.	24
0	Sorry. Gosh, I feel really silly now. Moar coffee.	24
0	Semantically speaking, worlds without beings would not be worlds.  But, if you insist otherwise,  let me rephrase it for you.   My question is whether God created any beings beyond the beings that we know about.	24
0	I think you're the racist for linking a religion to a specific ethnicity.	24
0	It was a "Jump to Conclusions" mat. You see, it would be this mat that you would put on the floor... and would have different *conclusions* written on it that you could *jump to*.   That's the worst idea I've ever heard in my life, Tom.   Yes, this is horrible, this idea.	24
0	Yeah, and you can express free speech without a newspaper.  But maybe I want a newspaper and a prayer day.  There is no good reason to avoid either.	24
0	Easy there Tiger.  I'm seminary-trained and teach at an academic think tank.  Yes, I'm reducing the issue a bit, because this claims to be a subreddit for Christians who already think the Bible is reliable.  I don't think I have to start from square one every day.  We do know who wrote the gospels.  And we know within 10+ years when they were written and how they were circulated.  By the third century, only one NT book had questionable authorship, and it wasn't one of the gospels.	24
0	&gt; I am, because there is a reason it is unlawful.   This is your opinion, not fact. It's not in the constitution, or else there wouldn't be a National Day of Prayer.	24
0	Have a good day.  I think I'm done with your tone and your claims.	24
0	Just read it and you will see	24
0	Poor but the cures of cancer worked when rich churches didn't.  The devil left the poor churches and found comfort in rich churches.	24
0	Me and I would hope more people because this is insulting.	24
0	Because we need to help these poor people see the truth. Also, it is not me who cares, but if some other 15 year old goes there and sees that they may now want to be enlightened by Christianity anymore.	24
0	You said it was painful.	24
0	I suppose I'm a bit guilty of being hyperbolic there. Truth in the sense that there is no proof of him being actually physically seen if he exists.	24
0	&gt; It is even a possibility that when Jesus talks about 'eternal life' he is talking about a full life lived in this moment rather than about life which goes on forever.  Please explain this using verses that talk about the rewards you get in the (not so) after life. No understanding of the bible would lead me to believe such a thing. Feel free to enlighten me on that interpretation.	24
0	Now gay sex is accidental and can only be done occasionally?  Nice try, bigot.	24
0	Yay, let's mock the atheist for defending his marriage to his wife. Stay classy.	24
0	And recreational use in the USA, as well.	24
0	So what? If they want to get their flag put up for their special holiday I am fine with it. Im not going to get upset if the pentagram flies, I am going to wonder what idiot worships a deushbag like satan. As long as their not commiting some crime like human sacrifice or something they can continue in their ignorance.	24
0	True, it's "intolerant fanatics fighting each other, with a sprinkle of greed towards the end (IVth crusade)."	24
0	Infinities only exist in time. God is eternal. He exists outside of time as God.	24
0	Mock verb \ˈmäk, ˈmȯk\ : to laugh at or make fun of (someone or something) especially by copying an action or a way of behaving or speaking	24
0	There are religions that do not pray, and there are religions that do pray, and there are people who are not religious and therefore do not pray. National day of prayer promotes the religions that do pray. It's not a specific religion, it's all the religions that pray. The Constitution does not say "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, unless it establishes multiple religions at a time, in which case that's cool." It says it can't establish any religion.	24
0	1 Corinthians 7:15 NASB  Yet if the unbelieving one leaves, let him leave; the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us to peace.  This passage permits divorce. The nonbeliever doesn't sin by leaving and the believer doesn't sin by letting them go. This is not a license to remarry, were that the case there would be internal inconsistencies in scripture as scripture expressly, explicitly, clearly prohibits remarriage while the former spouse lives. To do so is adultery. Jesus says it, Paul repeats it. Twice.	24
0	Strawman, because one's sexual identity doesn't frame one's worldview to the extent that religion does, and it's not even close.	24
0	What??? You must have stopped going to church because of some other type of people...   Tell me, just how invested am I in the religion of Christianity in America?  I would venture to say, you have no idea what religion is about and that you are equally as ignorant as many of it's blind-followers.	24
0	The difference being that god would exist in that world but not ours ;)  I'm kind of splitting hairs at this point though.  Back to the topic at hand though, why do you think we can't handle God directly telling us what's the best way of doing things?	24
0	So what would be the difference between what we understand as eternal and "the old greek eternal"?  I had a verse in mind when writing my comment and if I remember it I'll write it down, but without a specific verse, what are the new heaven, heaven itself, and the paradise Jesus talks about (thinking here of the cross scene with the other criminal) that come after our earthly death?	24
0	&gt; You don't think you should respect the opinions of your neighbours?  I should respect it, and I do respect it. Doesn't mean I'll agree with it.  &gt; I feel it encroaches upon my freedoms  And what freedom(s) is that?  &gt; Can't you have a christian organized prayer day, rather than a nationally sanctioned one?  Every day is prayer day, but I also want a nationally sanctioned one, partly to spite those who vehemently disagree with it, and partly because it keeps this country rooted as a country of religious freedom.	24
0	Um, what other view would be biblical besides abstinence??? This should be a no-brainer. The comments on here are sickening.	24
0	that's exactly what a strawman is, you're re-framing the argument towards something else and attacking that re-frame. I agree, some people identify with their sexual identity stronger than some religious folk with their religion, but that doesn't change anything because that's not normative.	24
0	&gt; A certain portion of teenagers are going to have sex.  Seriously. No one in this sub-thread has supported abstinence education. They have disputed the statement that literally every single teenager that isn't locked in a tower is having sex.	24
0	This crap is why taking some Christians seriously on their interpretation of their faith is so hard.   So, right now, you're telling /u/jcrave and myself that he isn't married because *you* have some kind of in with God. Also, he shouldn't be offended by this. Do you hear yourself? If you want someone to know God, wouldn't it be better to be a loving person who shows kindness and compassion rather than hate mongering mixed faith marriages of people you don't even know?  brosef.	24
0	No it can't. Atheism isn't a thing. It's lack of a thing. If Stalin created a league of militant atheists, then whatever. That's nothing I'm part of. That's just a name. Atheism is not a collective that follows any doctrine. It is only the common lack of belief in religion. It is lack of belief in stuff, not belief in anything.   You could create a cult with atheism in the name if you want to, but it is not the philosophy of atheists to follow any doctrines together. It is simply the philosophy not to follow any religious doctrines.	24
0	I can't wait for the synod. Schism here we go.	24
0	Very cool. Glad to see the Church reach out to sufferers of same-sex attraction.	24
0	So you know how to protect your child better than God does?	24
0	Thanks for being offended on other people's behalf that weren't offended in the first place.	24
0	And just because they didn't give God the specific offering he wanted, God burned them alive? That's really...I don't know. It's upsetting. Is that really all they did to warrant such wrath?	24
0	Muslims hold that the New Testament was corrupted by St. Paul, and that he is called Paul the Corruptor, and as one might expect form such a title, he is in the lowest level of hell.	24
0	Brit here, if you're gonna pray for anything, pray that UKIP don't get any seats!	24
0	How does 'being like Jesus' constitute good advice concerning how to deal with humanitarian aid, foreign and internal policy, as well as how to behave?   People have been studying Jesus' sayings for the past 2,000 years and nobody can agree on exactly the same thing. Some people think Jesus wants peace and love, and others think Jesus wants us to give tax breaks to the rich and to invade foreign countries.  If God's only advice is to be like Jesus, then I don't think that god is particularly competent.	24
0	There's a certain level of idiocy when you post what the Bible says about Jesus' return, but leave out the clearest one that contradicts your title.  And there's a certain way to respond to that person on an anonymous internet forum.  And it's to call him numb-nuts.	24
0	Do try to explain the things you say in a way that makes sense.	24
0	&gt; "Our challenge is so strong, our claim is so correct," she said. "The First Amendment says, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.' 'No law' should mean no law!"  She conveniently forgets the rest of that phrase: "Nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof..." STFU, FFRF. You can't tell us to NOT WORSHIP, and neither can Congress.	24
0	I have no idea what you're getting at.	24
0	So, you think God does in fact tell us the best way to do things. Can you elaborate on why you think he does, and how exactly that advice applies?  As they say, the devil is in the details.	24
0	Maybe.  Or maybe part of the reason that unhelpful nonsense gets passed on as historic Christianity is because no one calls people out on ridiculous posts.  There is a limit to how empathetic we can be, and that limit (in my opinion) is allowing non-truth to be called truth.	24
0	I don't want to hash out the whole argument again, but you at least realize that a certain percentage (maybe majority, maybe minority) of Christians on this planet think that being gay is a bad thing, right?	24
0	When someone shows me I'm wrong, I change my behavior.  That is how my past has worked out.	24
0	And here we go...  Gay is the new black.	24
0	Tithing in apostles time were through agriculture or at least that was in the old testament.  Soup kitchens is agrculture. Makeca wish is clothing . Clothing is a tithe. Gathering is a worship. God is always in the midst.  The laity will need to work for free. This is a great start how the church is supposed to be like.	24
0	Preaching a sermon only take 15 minutes and holy spirit is the one that leads the talk. Healing comes from the Lord.  The pastor has time to build things for ceasar's coins.	24
0	You'll need to prevent yourself except from environmental reasons that can't be helped. The Qi does the work of unblocking blockages that deprives tissues from oxygen and nutrients. Greed makes phony hearts and phony hearts makes them sick in most cases according to traditional chinese medicine.	24
0	I am glad too, I hope he helps them to overcome their problem. There is another possibility, seeing the state of the church, and it is that he encourages them to keep on their lifestyle, but given the information on the article, we cant really know.	24
0	&gt; iconography is idolatry!  Amen.	24
0	I probably won't have time to read those. Can I have your take on them?	24
0	&gt; having a day of prayer is in conflict with teh spirit of why there is a first amendment in the constitution in the first place  Sorry pal. the spirit of why there is a first ammendment is that the European countries in the 18th century all had state established religions. Anyone not following the state religion was subject to all manner of violence from the state including death.	24
0	The parallels are a question about empathy and how Christians and society react to each other.  But that's not the question.  The question is whether or not gay is good.	24
0	Imagine you are a stick figure in a 2D world. You were created by a 3D pencil. As a stick figure, could you ever imagine what a 3D pencil looks like?	24
0	&gt; 99% of prayers seem to go unanswered.  They are always answered.  Sometimes the answer is, "No."	24
0	&gt; They have no issue with people practicing religion outside the public sphere, but when the government gets involved it has to stay neutral.  But what if a government official is Christian, and he wants to pray in public? Is he not allowed to exercise his own faith in public? Let's assume that there is no NDoP, what then?	24
0	It could be the latter, or the former.  Either way, Christians should take a strong stance against fattery.	24
0	It's a sign of this community that you can say homosexuality is wrong, and then you feel obligated to say you don't hate gays.	24
0	Which people become obese without overeating?  How many?  Very few.  Christianity must take a stand against this epidemic of gluttony.  God does not love ugly.	24
0	&gt; But he can't lead congress in a prayer, or lead a public school in prayer.  There's so many ways for him to bypass this. In fact, I heard of a public school principal praying at the end of a ceremony. He said, "I'm not allowed to lead a prayer, so I'll just pray by myself right now...out loud, with this mic." Or something like that.	24
0	Of course, because an overarching Christian culture would solve all the problems. As you can see in Canada, we have no cultural pluralism and no problems.  Oh wait...	24
0	Praying for a Tory victory for sure :)	24
0	So we can't note where we are being consistent in interpreting Paul's meaning? We have to focus on your argument which has very little doctrinal, historical, contextual, and [linguistical](https://carm.org/romans-1-26-27-homosexuality) backing?   Not going to do that.	24
0	Of course not, how is that a question? We are talking about people that, because of problems in their development, have become gay but they want to be Christian, not about people that, because of problems in their development, have become gay and want to do whatever they want to the expenses of other people, kids in your example. But nobody is going to, or at least should not, shame a gay person for being gay, the church should help that person to overcome his problem.	24
0	hey! I already answer your question, look at my new comment.	24
0	look at my new comment, i've posted my answer.	24
0	Somehow outsider chose worse mods than the old ones. Your disgusting moderating made me quit this community altogether. I'd rather die than associate with this travesty of a Christian community. Thanks! Let the atheists dessicated this dead appendage of Christ's body of faith	24
0	Thanks for calling me clever. And I didn’t make any argument, this is just a board on the internet you know? I'm not willing to waste my time arguing with people who would not change their minds because they lack basic vocabulary in common with me, if you don't accept what a real family is, then we don’t have anything to discuss, since the discussion will not be productive at all.If you want to know more on sharing a basic set of vocabulary, you have at your disposition "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" by Thomas Kuhn.	24
0	Feel free to give me design ideas, I'll happily steal them :)	24
0	let us read,  Sola fide (Latin: by faith alone), also historically known as the doctrine of justification by faith alone, is a Christian theological doctrine that distinguishes most Protestant denominations from Catholicism, Orthodox Christianity, and some in the Restoration Movement.   In Christianity, an antinomian denies the fixed meaning and applicability of moral law and believes that salvation is attained solely through faith and divine grace. Many antinomians, however, believe that Christians will obey moral law despite being free from it.  these are beliefs made by man, does God agrees to it? or are these beliefs biblical? i am sorry but those are not biblical.	24
0	so therefore, it is not right to put the word "ALONE" after the word faith? like "FAITH ALONE"? because "faith" and "work" are two different things and subjects, You cannot say, Faith alone and then all of a sudden you include "work". You should not say, "faith alone", it is better to say, "faith" or "work" can save us, because saying "faith alone" is MISLEADING. Not all faith is resulting to good work.	24
0	You're failing to distinguish between the desire to do something and the act of doing it.   His blindness metaphor sucked and you seem hung up on that but I think he was picking something innocuous to preface the other analogies.	24
0	Everything you stated is highly offensive. Being gay is not like any of those things.	24
0	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions I though you atheist were more interested in science?	24
0	do you know that not all faith is leading to goodworks? so saying "faith alone" is not biblical and there are faith that does not have work. Faith does not automatically lead you to work, no. it is not something that go hand-in-hand to some, for true Christians, it should go hand in hand but there is a faith in a man that does not force him to do work, so faith and woks do not work automatically because there are faith that does not motivates people to do good but evil. So faith alone is not biblical.	24
0	No, it was the worst because it doesn't represent a tendency or a desire. /u/PlasmaBurnz used the (better) example of alcoholism. Some people are genetically predisposed to alcoholism. Is that their fault? Of course not, but they have a *choice* whether to indulge in alcohol.  The exact same could be said for gays, assuming they are sentient, self-aware beings like every other human being.	24
0	Well, this is my last comment on this thread since people is saying again and again the same things. The book has nothing to do with homosexuality, it deals with sharing a basic sets of definitions among other things about the basis of science , like I said earlier. When you are having a discussion on a board, you expect people to at least read your comments, and this is just another reason why I said that I won't keep on commenting on this thread, since I'm wasting my time.	24
0	By the doctrine of the trinity Jesus and God are the same so Jesus can't look to God for instruction. he *is* God.	24
0	&gt;Why can't Tradition be considered a rule of faith as well? Like a regulative principle to interpret Scripture for example.  It is, tradition is the normed norm and Scripture is the norming norm. That is to say that we judge the truth of tradition (the creeds etc.) on the basis of its agreement with Scripture which is why the Book of Concord contains the Creeds.  I think too many people have this idea that Sola Scriptura means you can't use or value tradition as if its just you sitting with the Bible coming up with doctrine. When it means that Scripture alone is the norming norm for the faith.	24
0	Objective was met, irrelevant of who or how you may or may not want it conducted. Glad to hear you happened to watch Fox and Friends!	24
0	Ok, enjoy your dawkin books, since they are so contemporary xDDDD. I guess you don’t like Plato's works uh? He was a fascist after all and from 2500 years ago! wow, just in the middle since earth creation.	24
0	Real time analysis says maybe not.	24
0	/Yes, you can because a person's faith is what saves them./  - what faith saves people? faith alone? or holy faith?   you see, holy faith IS NOT faith alone, because holy faith is with work. When you say faith alone, it does not include work, dont you know the meaning of faith alone?	24
0	I'm a sinner, and I struggle with soft lies to get away of situations that I don't like. For example, if you would ask me what I am doing and I'm doing something very long to explain, I would just say "playing games" or something. I try to overcome this.	24
0	The definition exists, but it is implicit rather than explicit. There's the Genesis verses and Jesus' reiteration like you said. Deuteronomy 22:22 is the death penalty for sleeping with another man's wife. I guess we're just not going to agree.	24
0	I'm right with you there. I was super-Catholic for a long time and probably know the Catholic teaching on most things better than 99% of Catholics (the ones on here have a much higher chance of being in the other 1%), but since I don't believe it they keep telling me "Oh, well you just don't understand it very well." No, I understand it *too* well, that's why I don't believe it.	24
0	I don't see why the word "shaming" is necessary.  The person is no more being "shamed" than a person who is divorced and remarried person is.  They are asked to live their life in accord with Catholic teaching, whatever the effects of that may be.	24
0	that's their best song!	24
0	If you think there's nothing wrong with gay sex so be it, but your argument that gay sex is ok just because the attraction is innate doesn't make a lot of sense. That was the point of the analogy. You're shifting the goal posts now and I don't feel like going down that rabbit hole.	24
0	Taken part in, or led the prayers of?	24
0	Let's test this theory:  Say a brother and sister, uncoerced etc., go to a courthouse and sign marriage paperwork.  They have kids, and 10 years later decide to convert to Catholicism.  Should they be allowed to remain as is?  Why or why not?  Your previous comment would suggest the Church allow them to continue as is.	24
0	I've had a lot of friends tell me Dream theater is good! Too bad it just doesn't click with me!  If there's another power metal band I really like it would be Kamelot though!	24
0	Your original comment was a reply to /u/PlasmaBurnz who was clearly distinguishing between gay urges and gay actions. You're the one who misunderstood.  But regardless, I agree there's nothing bad about *being* gay, at least not in the moral sense. It's bad like being blind or left handed, in the sense that it's inconvenient for the person affected.	24
0	nope! faith alone wont save you.  let me prove it,  James 2:14  14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?  can faith without works save? of course not.   dont you know that meaning of faith alone?	24
0	I'm a man of few words.	24
0	&gt; You're phrasing makes it sound like you think John has Jesus just beaming into our plane of existence...  Well, he kind of did. If he is part of a trinity that existed in some other plane before this universe was created. It is just that the transporter pad took 9 months to reassemble his pattern.	24
0	Everyone is a teacher.  God brings all of us together.  You asking me to follow the trial of a long ordination lists? Its the simplicity that dominates the complicity like water yields the hard. Its the simple that wins over the intelligence	24

0	[Its a violation of the Catholic understanding of the 6th commandment.](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm)	24
0	Its true that being born gay doesn't justify homosexual acts. But the fact that they're not wrong does, so its kind of a moot point.	24
0	It's a test of the theory that what he considers inducing shame is bad or merits that wording.	24
0	let me ask you, when we say " faith alone" what does it mean for you? is faith alone for you is a combination of faith and work? if it does, i guess you have to think twice because faith alone means faith alone and work alone means work alone.	24
0	Next time I set foot in a Catholic Church will be for a gay Catholic wedding.	24
0	I'd say there's more cultural pluralism in Canada than the US, and there also seems to be less problems.  "Problems would go away if everyone could agree with me" seems a bit simplistic.	24
0	I feel bad for the kid. His hormones are naturally out of whack, and one of the most embarrassing and trivial natural bodily functions is now central to a debate about his spiritual purity.   Subsets of Christianity disagree *completely* with the hard-line approach.   I think the hard-line approach can be incredibly damaging, and further, I think it is therefore highly immoral.	24
0	Gnosis christian... Gnosis were major heretics. I've looked into Gnostic Christianity and it's safe to say that all of you gnostics are essentially pagans. You are essentially a cultists.	24
0	I don't get it. You've got a generous heart when it comes to people's physical needs, but then this "pull yourself up by your own bootstraps" mentality when it comes to their spiritual needs. Why the disconnect? If people sometimes need help with feeding their physical body, do they not also sometimes need help with their spiritual body?	24
0	let me paste this verse,  James 2:18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.  is there faith alone in the verse? yes! it is the faith without works and that is the faith that born again has.   right?	24

0	I almost don't blame him. He is of an entirely different generation in which this mentality is common. It might be incorrect, but it is common.	24
0	We are.   I think that teaching them otherwise is impractical, incorrect, and sets them up for serious psychological harm; and I'm tempted to categorize it as abuse.  Sexuality might be the greatest challenge for reconciling different faiths with each other and with secular morality.	24
0	As far as I know the Bible is silent on the issue. It provides no basis for a belief that masturbation is wrong.	24

If he won't stop listening to the music his parents don't approve of, he deserves a smack. (And/or the iPod being taken away)	24

0	I think God did it perfectly as is.	24
0	Your point? Scripture emphasizes that we should be wise and not fools.  I see nothing wrong with being frustrated with Christians that glory in their lack of intelligence.  Where is the benefit in encouraging foolishness and complacency? God gave us brains, so why are so many Christians afraid to use them?	24
0	It's irrelevant. My statement stands regardless of the content of the Bill of Rights. Don't sanctimoniously prance around pretending to be a democrat except for when it's inconvenient for you.  I don't need a lecture on the Constitution, I know what's in it, and I understand what's in it.	24
0	So you agree with the professor's actions?	24
0	A small town just south of me recently shutdown a wedding chapel because it didn't want to marry gay couples. The same town is also passing laws to force all churches to perform homosexual weddings.	24
0	I think his actions were very unprofessional. His beliefs &amp; dis-beliefs should never affect how he treats his students.	24
0	So why circlejerk about "faux news" if they're accurately reporting this professor's action.	24

0	Seek my dude, if you believe in God then seek the answers you need answered. Not like seek by reading the bible a ton, but seek God. Like in life, in the world, in everything. Seek long enough and you will find.	24
0	So your position is that you don't like it so the passage has to be wrong in every ancient manuscript we have?	24
0	I never fucking said we're a democracy. I said that the people who constantly harp on about "democracy" are usually the same people with a fanatical obsession with ending public expression with religion. See any braindead liberal in /r/politics.	24
0	I kinda have to agree with the guy on this one. Not that you all do it on purpose, but from what I've read, a lot of people here just basically choose to believe what they want to believe from the bible and close their eyes to what they don't like.	24
0	&gt;Same-sex attraction is not a choice just like opposite sex attraction is not a choice.   I have to disagree with this one.  For me, it is every bit a choice, even subconsciously, that was shaped by our surroundings.  We choose that which is laid before us.  Our nurturing tends to steer our nature more than what we would like to believe so.  The way I address this is that I say it's usually more complicated than that.  But, overall I agree with the post.	24
0	These religious fanatics, for crying out loud... homosexuality occurs in most animal species, please go on about how it' s unnatural and a sin. This is exactly why I despise religion in general, causes way too much needless discrimination and misery in the world.	24
0	Oh, sorry to hurt you with my mere opinion.	24
0	We'll that's why I said it's complicated.  But as I had mentioned, we are pigenholed to interact with either boys or girls and the choices are limited in that sense.    &gt;If you can choose whether or not you're attracted to everyone you meet  But it happens all the time.  In fact, we dabble in things because have identity crisis.  Very seldom do we do things because we inherently like it, we seek examples and copies and then we imitate.	24
0	I only agree partially with this list and I think aspects of it are very patronising.	24
0	I was groomed to be.  Had society shaped me to be homosexual, I would likely be a homosexual.	24
0	&gt; Whether sexuality is a choice is not subjective and therefore there's no need to have an opinion on it.  But what If I decide to dabble into homosexuality or polyamory and find that I like it?  Did I not have a choice in that matter or was I simply being true to my biological instincts?	24
0	But liking it doesn't automatically equate to me being exclusively biologically inclined to like it.  That's the shoddy science most people are making here.  As if I have no choice in the matter because of my genes.	24
0	What if I'm a white male and I have no problem being called *white boy, whitey, cracker or paleface*?	24
0	[In this video,] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NyX5CxGraE) the former president of the American Psychiatric Association says that homosexuals are blocking science from being performed and are hijacking learning institutions for their own political and sexual goals.  So he's a psychologist. Does that change your mind?  Edit: Guess not. Can't say I'm really surprised.	24
0	Look, polyamory isn't a choice either, we've just been conditioned to play by the rules of monogamy.  I'm not one to blame all my actions on my biology.  The fact that people have restraint at all is a beautiful thing.  But don't give me that double standard that our biological urges only work for homosexuality/heterosexuality/Bi-sexuality and not for urges like polyamory.  At least acknowledge that both of those preferences are equally valid forms of sexuality and as a result are biologically natrual.	24
0	How would you respond to someone who says that they're probably polyamorist because perhaps they're biologically inclined to be so?  Would that be a valid point?	24
0	True, but hating on Fox is a standard reddit circlejerk. And for all of Fox's flaws, they're still a more legitimate source of news than a lot of the clickbait that sometimes gets linked here.	24
0	No.  Why would it be wrong?	24
0	I'm using it as a counter argument to people who claim it's unnatural or even a free choice. If even animals are born with it, why shouldn't it be the case for us humans? We're nothing but mammals.	24
0	&gt; I'm polyamorous but believe I could still happily live in a monogamous relationship  Maybe it's time to come out of the monogamy closet and be your true self?  If it's true that you have no choice in that matter due to your biology, why hold back?	24
0	I was thinking the same thing.	24
0	False equivalency. Jesus performed miracles, and fulfilled a great many prophecies.	24
0	Well ideally in life u should have days of heaven on earth	24
0	&gt; Well, from where I'm sitting, Christianity is just as obviously false as the cult.  Doesn't matter what you think. You will discover very abruptly that you were mistaken after death. What happens after that is your own fault.	24
0	Even if it is a result of people's backgrounds. The point made when we say that 'it isn't a choice' remains.	24
0	&gt; but appealing to nature isn't going to win anyone over to our side. The killing of partners and offspring is found in many species, but we don't let that fly for humans.  Why don't we let that fly as humans? Could it be that it's not in our nature? Or not in our more recent enlightened nature anyway.	24
0	I have a friend that says he has the "cheater gene".  That somehow he has a biological aversion to commitment.  Maybe he's onto something?	24
0	Being gay isn't a choice, but it is obviously a defect that you can avoid.  EDIT: What's with all the hate? Homosexuality is OBVIOUSLY a biological defect, there's no way in denying that.	24
0	Lake of fire exists for exactly this reason. It comes from the word of God. Maybe you're confused on which reddit to hang out in.	24
0	You are in the lion's den. You need the armor of God while in college.	24
0	Well from popular opinon on here, it seems to have biological merits.	24
0	[Jesus asked for prayers *unrepeated*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6:7&amp;version=NKJV): He asks for your expressions. These might *be similar* on occassions, but they won't follow a formula.	24
0	Perhaps some people are polyamorist because they are biologically inclined to be so.  The idea in here, and most of us here agree, that our behaviors are a result of our genetics and absolves us of our sexual preferences.	24
0	Salvation is meant for all. Reconciliation is meant for all.	24
0	I know! Its totally different than a white guy talking to blacks about the traditional roles of slaves! We intend the best for them, their pretty little heads can't handle it so the men should set them straight with scripture written by men. Because women have no agency and shouldn't decide on their own how to live their lives.	24
0	Stressed about what? The love of God? Are you feeling stressed and wish to talk about it?	24
0	Yes the person would be saved.	24
0	How does this answer my question? Pretty vague if you ask me. I always get this answer "that's just how God likes to work" as if that answers anything? How can this answer satisfy anyone... It baffles me. It's just a cop out tbh.	24
0	I don't see how this answers my question in any way to be honest...	24
0	A very fine line between being a loving brother/sister in Christ to someone who is LGBT and being someone who is supportive of a theology that blasphemes the words of Christ.   That being said, it's sad that we live in such a broken world and have people getting pushed away from the love of Christ.	24
0	If I deleted it, you wouldn't know what it said.	24
0	Christ *returned from the dead*. My faith is good enough for me, but resurrection on top of that? If you need more, you're unreasonable and simply do not want to believe. I can guess why that is.	24
0	If you say so. The question remains though: why would he reveal himself to such a small group when he could have just "notified" everyone and be done with it.  Another question: why hasn't he shown himself since? It's like he's actively trying to hide from everyone.	24
0	Because Christ conquered death. If their leader can do that, I may give him a second look.	24
0	Aaaaand you've lost me. I'm sorry but I haven't a clue what you're talking about.	24
0	Right, so neither is it EXCLUSIVELY genetic.	24
0	You'd agree that polyamory is a sexual preference that can proven to be biological.  Right?	24
0	&gt;one man  Well, more like the *former president of the American Psychiatric Association.* Not really fair to refer to him as "some guy" especially since earlier you asked for psychological credentials in order to continue this discussion.  &gt;The Jews run wall street and the president is an alien.  I dunno man you seem kinda mad. Is this what happens when you are presented with facts you don't like?  Hmm...	24
0	Generally the argument goes like this; I have no choice because I was genetically predisposed to be this way, please accept me, I can't help it.  Which is fine, so long as we also pay the same respect for those who are use the same argument, ie pederests.	24
0	I've always said that polyamory was a sexual preference.  And you'd probably agree that it is inherently genetic.	24
0	It's not that I'm not open to the Lord, as you say it. It's just that I don't see a reason to believe any of the scriptures aren't just collections of stories. I'm not disputing that there are some wise life lessons in there, that's the case for sure. I just don't believe these stories actually happened.	24
0	Can you provide evidence that there exist a gay-gene?	24
0	There is no moral argument if you really think about it.  We're all just biological predisposed to behave and do whatever we feel like.	24
0	We'll yes, I absolutely agree with you.  There's several factors that come into play.	24
0	Oh wow thanks.  Do you as a christian think that such impulses can be corrected?  For example, why homosexuality the exception to be accepted as okay and not something like pederest?	24
0	I've probably seen every video of him on the internet, love that guy.	24
0	&gt;Are you stubborn or stupid?  Yep well I think this conversation has just about reached it's potential. Fun times dude, I'll remember it always. Have a good night.	24
0	Okay, the abstract is a similarity within homosexuals.  But just how many heterosexuals also have those same qualities? All it says is a linkage and similarity between an already controlled group.	24
0	Yep, I was just speaking in general. Don't understand why there are still so many people holding on to this nonsense.	24
0	You certainly can believe that brother, but I don't. Oh I'll concede people can still be "born that way," but it's not because of their genes. God doesn't program people to desire sodomy. God is not the author of confusion, He doesn't make someone feel a certain way and then condemn them for it. Jesus frees from it, but it's more than just prayer. It requires much more.  Unclean spirits are not above inhabiting children, or even the unborn. Unfortunately that freaks most people out so I generally avoid talking about it.	24
0	I know. I also loved it when he challenged religious people with this quote in defence of atheism:  "Name me one good deed I could not do as a non-believer. Now think of one sinister action taken for the sake of religion, that a non-believer wouldn't do." You've already thought of one sinister action and you'll think of a couple more within the next minute.	24
0	Well I'd advise you burn your Harry Potter books since God hates sorcery. Doesn't matter if it's fictional, it's still filthy and wicked.	24
0	Awwe look at you, already denoting the pederast to be equivalent to the pedophile.  Just like how many conservatives believe that all the homosexual does is gay sex.  Come on, we can do better than this.	24
0	This sub has become daily propaganda.	24
0	Meet me at 10pm tomorrow.  Jax bar and Grill Glendale, CA.  Let's do this.	24
0	Fair point, I guess I know other people will read these discussions, and the idea that maybe someone will wake up as a result is honestly the only thing spurring me on. This is a pretty big subreddit after all. I wish someone had bothered to tell me about Satan's devices and the more meaty things in Christ when I was a teenager, but my church was lukewarm at best. Spiritual milk every day. I can't help but suspect others on here are in the same position.  Thanks for the encouragement though. It means a lot. :)	24
0	How do you know if your desires and inclinations are true if you haven't tried it yourself?	24
0	Really? That is somewhat surprising. How about blowing yourself up in the name of your God? Or mutilating the genitalia of newborns? Or killing apostates? These are just from the top of my head.	24
0	Other posters have already spoken for me.	24
0	&gt;Frankly, I'm not sure it was ever intended to do anything besides forbid the federal government from creating (a.k.a. establishing) a state religion.  It wasn't.	24
0	&gt; Just like society doesn't have a problem with pederasts until they rape someone.  But to you, they're (pederast and pedophile) both one and the same.	24
0	They always come up with something like this, because it's the only possible "answer". Kind of questionable if that would classify as a good deed though. From the point of view of an atheist it's kind of pointless to worship something that does not exist.	24
0	Why did this become a liberal propaganda subreddit.	24
0	Kinsey Scale, I'm glad you showed me that.  Yeah, I'm right up there with you.  As a man, I can see David Beckham as attractive, but I don't roll that way.  But if there's anything that I'm convinced with, had I the upbringing of being besotted with male figures in a sexual sense, I would have likely been nurtured towards that direction to be gay.  It's absolutely possible.  People don't realize that most of what humans do is imitate.	24
0	Just quoting something from the Bible isn't a very satisfying answer to me. I don't see what's so great about that explanation... What about those  whom he didn't reveal himself to and got killed?  What did these poor people do to not deserve his revelation? To me, it just sounds like a small club of people made up some stuff and killed everyone who disagreed.  And also: why hasn't he shown himself since? He wants us to believe in him based on hearsay from people who knew nothing compared to us... It's gonna take a bit more for me to be convinced of his existence.	24
0	Americans are too politically correct. I have gay friends and in my experience using the terms gay, "girl" (for a gay man), homo and even gay b*****d are used (as long as they're your friend).  We Australians don't have the hangups people in the US have.	24
0	Not a church but good fruits can be found within this message. Www.godsplanforall.com	24
0	I found 'Some Mistakes of Moses' By Robert Ingersal incredibly useful breakdown of Christianity if you seek a non-believers input.	24
0	Did you spend anytime seeking God in his word?   Faith does not grow when there is no relationship to grow it on.   If you do not seek God in his word it is little wonder your poor seed has almost shrivelled away.  The only way to enrich your faith is by seeking him in his word. You have built constructs that are proving to be houses of cards. Build a real relationship by getting to know him. Trust he will be found. He promises every earnest seeker the joy of finding him. You just have to want to bad enough. Peace.	24
0	Burn in hell if you don't accept Jesus, I've heard plenty of apologetic viewpoints which try to explain it away... but according to most Christians you burn.	24
0	Well, you're right. It is a problem. Not saying it isn't. But the whole of Christianity can't be judged for the actions of a few.	24
0	boy, you sound like a kind fellow /scarcasm	24
0	History is full of people who have been celibate for life. You just kind of get used to not having sex. Its even easier if you never have it in the first place.	24
0	I was pointing out that they always want to be called something else. Call them gay for long enough and that will become a slur too. There won't ever be a polite term for a homosexual.	24
0	Thats because you have been convinced that what you see on TV is a mirror of the real world, rather than as secular propaganda for what Hollywood wants the world to look like.	24
0	&gt; The natural attraction to the same sex is not a choice. It's how God made you. Why would he design you in a way that limits your ability to experience love? He wouldn't. He wants gay people to experience the same happiness straight people do through marriage and sex.  What about someone born with a sexual attraction towards animals, or someone who has sexual attractions towards siblings or their parents? How would your logic apply here?	24
0	You're assuming that God made people that way.   Are you also saying that God made people full of hate, lust, etc. that he made them blind, deaf, sick etc?   We're living in a fallen world with a lot of things that aren't as God originally made them... So why do you assume that Homosexuality is something God intended?	24
0	Skin color and sexual orientation are very different issues.  Gays may think not being able to get a wedding cake is discrimination, but read up on what happened to blacks in the South after 1865, and compare that to the  homosexual plight.  Not even close.	24
0	&gt; It's how God made you  A very large number of christians would disagree with this statement. Homosexuality may not be a choice but that does not mean that that is how God made them. We live in a fallen sinful world and sometimes that manifests in ways that are undesireable.	24

0	We should pray that they repent to avoid that exact fate; pray that they should come to know Jesus as savior, and repent of their evil.	24
0	The greatest lie ever told by the churches (and repeated ad nauseum); that you can't be good without God.  Because that's what you're saying. If secular reasoning can't tell us anything about what's moral or not, then we can't be good, and we're all a bunch of immoral people, every last one of us. Do you really think this is true?	24
0	E Pluribus Unum means out of many, one. When you have a national day of prayer that's been by an large co-opted by the Christian majority, then you're not making out of many one, you're making it so that the one voice is Christian, and if you're not it, you can convert or get out.  That's not very inclusive, and not inclusive is the definition of divisive.	24
0	&gt; Christians draw a distinction between the various types of honor given to people and objects and those distinctions are not always visibly or linguistically clear, particularly in English.  *Some* Christians draw that distinction, others do not.  That's part of why we have disagreements like those /u/maslowk posted.	24
0	&gt;What is the purpose of living?  Being in the moment.  I learned that from my dog hanging his head out the window as we drive down the road.	24
0	He must be old.	24
0	This is a nonsense justification for Catholic absolution.   Anyone with the Holy Spirit can forgive even the harshest actions of their brother and sister if they've shown repentance.   What utter deception it is to teach that only such power was afforded to the apostles. It does not pass the test of practical real life.	24
0	It is a matter of will. With God anything is possible. Certainly overcoming even the highest libido is possible if a person makes the effort and enlists the Holy Spirits aid in their endeavor.	24
0	True, and the bible also calls homosexual sex a sin.  For heterosexuals marriage is an option. For homosexuals celibacy is the only option and God will provide for what they need to make this happen.	24
0	Who is God really?  Any description must include a God Who is infinitely loving and Who prepared for sinners an "everlasting fire that was prepared for the devil and his angels."	24
0	that is not helpful without the context.	24
0	About 2/3 of Christians in the world *are supposed to* draw this distinction.  I doubt that many of them do in practice.	24
0	&gt;  how do you differentiate homosexuality from other character flaws  ... Exactly how do you claim that a a trait that between 6 and 10 % of the human population, (as well as all mammals and Birds), ***are born with, is a character flaw????***	24
0	Glad I read this, thanks for posting!  Man, this is a tough topic.  I'm certainly convicted, because I know that my abhorring the sin and the modern culture's celebration of it is constantly blinding me to the sin of failing to respect people's dignity, and God's love for them.  God's law is being attacked tooth-and-nail, and, worst of all, Christ is being flayed again by the liberal churches that say sin is not sin, and I want to grab a sword like Peter.  And in that desire I hear the challenging radicalism of Christ to put it away.	24
0	The Bible is old. He illustrated the bible. He must be old.	24
0	You do realize that eliminates a lot of the church fathers, too, right?	24
0	I mean he's not alone in this thread or in this subreddit in this circlejerk.	24
0	Why does she refuse it	24
0	Tertullian believed the Logos was consubstantial with God, but nonetheless created.  Clement of Alexandria and Origen's christology deviate from creedal orthodoxy even more.  The majority of patristic scholars believe that prior to Nicea the church was subordinationist.	24
0	This is a good answer.	24
0	All right. I agree we should be trying to fix it.	24
0	The mods have always been good to me and allowed my posts to stay up. I am always sure to respond to people that reply and have had some good discussion with many of them.	24
0	The point is that celibicy is possible. It is even rewarding when you funnel all that time money and energy most people spend on getting laid into other worthwhile endeavors.	24
0	Since he has declared homosexual sex as a sin then he must select homosexuals for celibacy.	24
0	The name stems from me trying to convey many of the things I receive from my personal relationship with God (Stress management, positive outlook on life, etc.) in a way that everyone can enjoy and hopefully find some inspiration in.	24
0	fair enough i suppose......	24
0	Also, thank you for always being kind and allowing me to post my blog on this sub. I truly do appreciate it. I am simply trying to shine a little light in this dark world.	24
0	I'd rather see him dialogue with the work of John Henry Newman and Bishop Richard Hanson.  Among others.	24
0	He does know that there are printing presses already doing that, right?	24
0	&gt; I cannot masturbate without stimulation.  Seriously, I find that pure bollox. You might need some time so your body gets used to only physical stimulation, but it works, did it myself. There is really no reason to justify sinning (and by that I'm only refering to porn/fantasies) because you "need" stimulation.	24
0	Bam. mic drop. Perfect.	24
0	For a while, it might be valid but going months or years without sexual intimacy in a marriage is going to be a major strain on the relationship.	24
0	That is a good point and I will be sure to do that in the future. Thank you	24
0	Lets map it out.  1. God gives all people the capacity to live life without committing sexual sin. 2. He ordains marriage between a man and a woman as the one situation where sex is intended to be used. 3. Some people are born incapable of opposite sex attraction. 4. He provides these people with the capacity for celibacy.	24
0	The Christian right-wing lobby spends 150$ more or less, for every dollar spent combatting their influence.  The right-wing lobby tends to lobby not only for Christian values, but there often are other values that they also carry forward.  Some of those values they (intentionally or not) lobby for include racist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic, and/or anti-environment ideologies and values.  I admit I wasn't as clear as I could have been the first time. Is this better?	24
0	You link posts to something else, looks like a phil of sex syllabus .	24
0	Thats a gross mischaricterization of what I was saying. Sex is intended as a tool to be used to form monogomous lifelong relationships between a man and a woman, and to produce children.	24
0	&gt; lusting after your wife  You can't lust after your spouse. Lust is an inordinate desire to possess and wives and husbands belong to each other, because they are one flesh.	24
0	Not under most circumstances. Agreeing reluctantly out of love certainly wouldn't be wrong.	24
0	It's "Ehrman." (Also, I hope I haven't come across as an evangelical apologist!)	24
0	No they don't. They just don't interpret it the way *you* want.	24
0	feel free to use this to promote our lord and savior :-)	24
0	So you die when you don't masturbate after 2 days or what? Unless you are dealing with ER, you won't have big problems. To me it's just a bad reason to justify sinning rather than giving God that part of your life.	24
0	&gt;  Its is a biologically successful strategy to have sex with as many women as possible.   Right, with that biological line of reasoning it should then be a moral incentive to cheat because we're naturally inclined to have sex with as many women as possible.  Therefore, if we buy into a biological basis for morality as such, cheating and polyamory is morally commendable. We're only doing what our incilinations are telling us, right?	24
0	So you're telling me that if someone is a practicing homosexual, it's only because they are ABSOLUTELY genetically predisposed to do so?	24
0	Even refusing your spouse (without good reason) once is gravely sinful - not merely "over a long term".	24
0	Change to something that doesn't believe God was in human form. You'll cut out all the metaphysical gymnastics of Christology and Trinitarian theology.	24
0	I don't get it.  How does the phrase he flipped to indicate his daughter was saved?	24
0	No, both masturbation and denying your spouse's right to have sex with you (without good reason) are gravely sinful and must be confessed and repented of.	24
0	&gt; Sorry, no. Same sex gender orientation is clearly biologically determined by a combination of genetics and the hormonal exposures in the womb.   Again this does not matter. there are all kinds of genetic diseases and problems that are biological and I still claim God did not cause them. God does not micromanage his creation. The idea that creation has fallen from the created ideal is an orthodox christian view. Your view that God causes every instance of evil in the world is extremely heterodox if not heresy.	24
0	I don't think it's possible to have sex with your spouse and it not be most of those things. If you're naked, it's intimate. If you touch, it's relational. If you are married, sex is inherently covenantal.	24
0	But as far as I know, lust and masturbation are not the same thing; they're two separate things. And the Bible is silent on the issue of masturbation. If it were not so, wouldn't people who were anti-masturbation point to a biblical basis for their beliefs?	24
0	But the spirit isn't in you.	24
0	So, is that a yes? You are referring to the Holy Spirit?	24
0	Yeah that's the one. People in this area have started a hate train against all religion over it. I support gay marriage from a legal standpoint; I just don't like the way things are turning right now in my area. I'm a libertarian and don't like seeing anyone's lifestyle forced on others, but everyone in my region feels the need to shove their morals in everyone else's face, no matter which side they're on.	24
0	Could you point me to a Bible verse then, please?	24
0	You're saying genetics, I'm saying it can be a result of genetics and social conditioning.  Now if you agree with me, then stop trying to disagree with me for the sake of trying to disagree with me.	24
0	That wasn't a parable: it didn't illustrate the arcane with the mundane; it just tells a documentary story of arcana straight up.  And Paradise and Torment are not Heaven and Hell. So *no*, I don't expect that *after judgment*.	24
0	Iconography is idolatry!!!!!111!!!!1!!	24
0	You comment makes no sense. are you sure you are responding to the right comment?	24
0	&gt; I see no suggestion that anyone should use it as a basis for morality at all. If anything, the opposite seems to be suggested, to wit: &gt; Most can keep it in their pants if they decide to.  The basis is exactly that!  A biological inclination to moral oughtness is absolutely consistent with homosexuality.  You're already supposing that somehow keeping it in their pants is somehow a morally better than keeping it out; it's neither.	24
0	Heresy.    First of all, God doesn't have to manage anything. Being omniscient all he had to do start create the Universe. he set it up perfectly so that every electron, every tick of time will being about his pre-determined result.  Your claim implies he has no idea what happens at the detail level. Nonsense. God is omniscient.  "All knowing".   God created each and every disease and beneficial effect of each affect in existence.	24
0	The gays constantly make fun of Christianity but we are supposed to be kind to them?	24
0	Don't have time, I'm talking to everyone on this forum, sum it up for me here via reply.  Do you agree with me that NOT all practicing homosexuals are genetic predisposed, but rather some are swayed by social condition to be homosexuals?  It's simple; yes or no.	24
0	We may have little to talk about: especially since you are so quick to dismiss someone who disagrees with you.  No, I'm not that guy. I think parables are a *specific type of metaphor that illustrates something otherworldly with a recognizable piece of Everyday Life*. And Jesus used them lots.	24
0	If you deny its power then the spirit isn't in you.	24
0	Stop telling me what you disagree with and start telling me what you DO agree with.  I asked you simply if you agree with me that NOT all practicing homosexuals are genetic predisposed, but rather some are swayed by social condition to be homosexuals? Rather than responding with a, I-Never-said-that response, can't you at the very least reply with a yes or no?	24
0	Isn't Catholicism basically the same thing as Christianity but it does adds more things that protestants don't believe?  Thank you for your answer!	24
0	What a crock of shit.	24
0	I do agree with you.  Politicians in general, however it seems to me that the right has used it as a more decisive measure over the last 15 years or so.	24
0	Didn't Jesus teach us to beware false prophets?  Maybe these are good questions to ask?  There's clearly a dialogue here than can stem from this question that maybe we could both learn from. Would that be so bad??	24
0	Do you agree with me that there also exist a subset of homosexuals who's genetic properties, epigenetic properties and pre-natal, womb-originated hormonal exposure's are equivalent to those of heterosexuals, who are rather socially conditioned to be homosexuals?  Seems to me like you don't.  So please clarify if you believe these people exist.	24
0	Ok. I'm not going to hate on people because of their preference or sin. We're all sinners. We're called to love everyone no matter what.	24
0	No sarcasm at all.  I'm Eastern Orthodox, of course I condemn iconography as idolatry.  That was decided at the Third Council of Nicaea.	24
0	Not sure what quote you're referring to. St. Paul said it is good to abstain, but this is only by consent of both spouses.	24
0	The proof is in the pudding	24
0	Same thing. ;)	24
0	The deffinition of lust is sexual desire. In case you misunderstood the word.	24
0	It is great in a loving lifelong relationship between man and woman. I know of nothing more destructive though, when taken outside of that context.	24
0	Once per thread with something like this please.  edit: If that. There are reasons why the things this sort of comment rebuts shouldn't need to get rebutted, but that's ill-formed in my mind, sorry.	24
0	Great sermon, thanks for sharing.  If anyone wants a defense of the specific points he raises and refutations of Catholic Answers, shoot me a PM.	24
0	None of this refutes what I wrote.  There is NO evidence that homosexuality is heritable - NONE.   What you've cited is largely incidental and anecdotal claims mixed with correlative arguments.  I am not saying it could not be heritable, but it has thus far not been shown to be so.  Like most human behaviors, my guess is that it is partly nature and partly nurture.	24
0	&gt; The fact that the owners of the business are ordained ministers has nothing to do with it.   In the eyes of the law they do some paperwork for you and then perform some theatre with audience participation.	24
0	...  Unless the sperm is deposited inside her vagina, anything sexual is gravely immoral.	24
0	The negative remarks go both ways.  A couple of Eastern Orthodox folks in the /r/Christianity IRC refer to our God as "monster god" and "evil". (By our God, I mean the Calvinistic interpretation of the Triune God of Scripture.)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  From the Reddiquette: Please don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.	24
0	This is a grossly misinformed statement. There is but one state church in Denmark. Yet all churches are compelled to participate in gay weddings.	24
0	Then I can grab a fiery sword, ride a horse, and chop people's heads off. Cool.	24
0	That's E talking. J believed that it was okay to use [God's name](http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-26.htm).  I am more in the camp of J.	24
0	Ooo. I'd love to. Are you wanting words? or definitions?	24
0	There are actually scientific studies regarding people that have sexual attraction towards animals. A [wikipedia search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophilia) will show you that.  My point was simply this: Someone being born with a tendency towards an action is not reason enough to make that action excusable. Scripture tells us that we are all born with a tendency toward sin, however, this does not make it OK for us to sin.	24
0	Count me in. Will you be notifying by PM on how to access? I'm new to this aspect of reddit.	24
0	Show me that they aren't also attracted to people as well.   Gay people can't also be attracted to the opposite sex. That's why that matters.	24
0	&gt; Gay people can't also be attracted to the opposite sex.  This is irrelevant. It does not excuse the sin.	24
0	I don't understand how people can equate God not saving a loved one's life with maybe God not existing at all. Is our creator a magic genie who grants wishes? If our wish comes true, God exists. If our wish doesn't come true, maybe God doesn't exist?	24
0	Jesus would probably support equal rights and free health care.  Edit: holy moly! Downvoted?!	24
0	It's not a sin. It's people expressing their love. How twisted does your mind have to be to think that could be a sin?   Also, attraction towards animals can never be consenting love like it can between adult humans.	24
0	A heterosexual couple is naturally capable of procreation even though a particular couple may be temporarily or permanently incapable of doing so. This nature is not only beneficial in creating life but also nurturing it with a father and mother. A homosexual couple is naturally non-procreative. Thus we don't have a fertility test for couples seeking marriage but we do have a male-female requirement. Yes, many people may think or prefer that procreation is completely irrelevant to marriage but that doesn't mean we should make it legally so.	24
0	I agree, since he also supported slavery and the oppression of women, two things god had shown he didn't care for by that time. Paul infused a lot of his own opinion in his work.  Note that none of Paul's verses actually condemn homosexuality as a sin, however. Massive misconception.	24
0	Open any chapter and read it	24
0	&gt; It is not just that I did not throw it off, but that I was unable to throw it off. The reason for this must be that it had become a part of me after all. The fact that it had penetrated me so deeply in my youth was a sign, I thought, that it had, in part at least, become coextensive with me.  This sounds... horrible...	24
0	I have found that many so called "conservative Christians" advocate war often. The mantra "turn it into a parking lot" or "kill me all" is often repeated on Facebook pages claiming to be of a Christian conservative nature. And we all know that modern war is anything but christian, and has everything to do with profits for contractors and corporations involved. I don't think Christ would've advocated sending a tomahawk into a village to kill a single person while wiping out 100.	24

0	If it helps, 24 is a little young to be worried about never getting married. Most people I know don't marry until their late 20s and some even into their 30s and 40s.  Your church situation sounds like a Duggars situation. Now I respect the right of people to handle their lives as they please, but I can tell you I would never marry a person who I had not dated, kissed or been alone with. And I am sure none of our priests would marry such a couple either.	24
0	Do you know anything about Christian Science?	24
0	&gt;I have made is that I will continue to pray to God asking Him to change my feelings,  Prayer by itself isn't enough... you have to be willing to actually do what God tells you to do... It may mean that you'll have to stop hanging out with some of your friends,  or getting rid of your television or Internet.   But always remeber this... God has _promised_ us that he will not let temptation be fall us, where we cannot be victorious over.. so when you get tempted,  know that you can overcome.    God bless.	24
0	&gt; thus far not met a potential spouse that I think would be worth sacrificing my lifestyle for  you mean... except for Jesus. :)  Edit: downvotes?!	24
0	I'm not sure what the sub's stance is but I think it is totally legitimate to call groups that are outside of the confines of orthodox Christianity heretical; if anything, not doing so is damaging	24

0	&gt; We're never going to end poverty. There are certainly lots of things we can do, but ending poverty wouldn't be possible even in a theoretical post-scarcity society.   Nonsense. We could end poverty today if we had the political will. We certainly have enough money to do so.	24
0	We have a very different understanding of what it means to be a Christian.  There is a difference between genuine believers and false professors.  All I know is that he professed Eastern Orthodoxy and was very devoted to Mary and the saints, and now he is a pagan.	24
0	A few bits of advice that might help :)  Firstly, uninstall counterstrike. The farther you can put yourself from that game the easier you will be able to get back to your old life or towards the life you want to live.   Secondly, if #1 doesn't work, I would reccomend you did what addicted pros who can't leave CS do. Get banned. Install some hacks and go fuck shit up. Then you won't be able to play anymore.	24
0	&gt; he did accept Jesus Christ as his lord and savior  Many false professors "accept Jesus Christ as their lord and savior", yet are unregenerate and do not truly believe.  I'm sure Joel Osteen "accepts Jesus Christ as his lord and savior", yet he's a false teacher who whores out his perversion of the gospel to make millions.  Again, this is where our worldviews conflict.  I believe that there is a difference between genuine faith given by God and the false faith of false professors, you don't.	24

0	&gt; Just imagine where we would be if every time a couple made love, it generated a baby!!!!  Not sure how this is related. Obviously God doesn't give you a child every time you have relations.  &gt; The planet would be at 700 Billion! We could populate Jupiter!  Not likely. IIRC, we need a few quadrillion just to populate Earth.	24
0	Christians aren't supposed to keep the Sabbath.	24
0	That's a meaningless vague statement. Anyone who gets married was lusting after their wife. So masturbating even earlier after a ague image of a future wife is not any different in any meaningful way other than that certain people's emotions think its indulgent.	24
0	Look folks, I disagree with lju most of the time too, but this is a perfectly reasonable post. Can we please not downvote just because we don't like somebody?	24
0	Ugh, sorry but I can't get over the fact that your denomination makes up artificial rules to control people.	24

0	Turn the other cheek? Speak out in protest? Post things on facebook such as  "look at this example of Christians being persecuted in our culture"	24
0	I have been Catholic all of my life, a "born again" Christian for almost a year now, and I have an INCREDIBLY hard time believing that Jesus would say that homosexual impurity is any different from any other sin. Through God, there is peace.	24

0	Yes.  Remember the part about "turn the other cheek"?	24
0	&gt; Witness given to me by the Holy Spirit.   I don't have anywhere else to go in this argument.   The witness of the Holy Spirit and the inerrancy of Scripture is as true as 2+2 on just an incredibly basic level of knowledge to me.	24
0	Just remember:  &gt; practice safe text, and use a comma; never miss a period.	24
0	Fine idea, but when their words and actions actually lead to deaths and others to fear for their life you need more than just prayers. You need people to stand up to them and get in their face about it. You need people to stand between them and those they are harming.	24
0	I remember when it came out some people did get embroiled in the gay allegory controversy, but missed a much more major theological issue in the story:  Elsa created life, an activity that is meant to be reserved for The Creator.	24
0	&gt; Do you really think it will help him find is faith again?  He never had genuine faith to begin with (The kind that is fruit of the Spirit; Galatians 5:22-23).  If God regenerates him, he'll have faith.  Regeneration is caused by God's grace, not any statement that I make.	24

0	&gt; The last church I was a part of made that case with The Matrix.  Any sermon based on a movie misses the entire point of what a sermon is.	24
0	Also, why go to church when I can get what I need to know from opening my bible? Yeah I know I said I don't read it, but it's not like I can't. There's not much hope to find community, because I go to a mega church, so there's too many people. Even if I looked for people to make friends with, there's the possibility that they may say the F words the same amount of times as me, but there's also the chance that they would be much more religious than me.	24
0	Show me a peer reviewed study that proves it.   There's a lot of "it's proved by science" hearsay.   But even if it was proved it doesn't matter. People are sinners from birth. How come the pro-LGBT believers seem to miss that?	24
0	It means those who are fakers or hypocrites should either get with the program or grow up and stop taking up seats in church. It's their life, they can choose either or but they shouldnt live a lie. I hate the phrase "you can't have your cake and eat it too", but I guess it'd be used for this example? And yeah it's your choice to get the siblings in the fold, but how will you know that the person prancing around and singing the loudest is a phony, unless God points him/her out to you?	24
0	&gt;If your God wasn't real, do you think there could exist some other being that you would choose to not worship if it meant being tortured for eternity?  Yeah, I could see that. Humanity is really short sighted so if I was forbidden from like pork or reading or something I could see myself rebelling. Even though its incredibly short sighted	24
0	so were jews, blacks and many other opressed minorities, do they have sex with over a thousand partners?	24
0	Wouldn't that be nice? It's ridiculously annoying that people auto down vote users.	24
0	So here's the thing. It's problematic to try and separate sex from procreation, because that's a fundamental part of sex. And not to turn this into a giant circle, but if you love him, why are you so afraid of committing?  And you avoiding a label because it can be misunderstood is also problematic. Denominations are more than just labels, they are statements of belief.	24
0	I think what you means to say is that those stastics were the reason for the aids epidemic, and the 75 % syphllus rate among gay men as of 2012 (not so obsolete)	24
0	This is why going to church is important.	24
0	&gt;My problem with it is that it implies that those who are still gay haven't tried hard enough, or haven't followed God enough.  Perhaps there is some truth to this statement.	24
0	&gt;Mary the mother of all christians  Nope.	24
0	What?? No we don't. This is unbiblical and a lie.	24
0	&gt; but if it is not in his plan to change my orientation, who am I to argue with that?   We know that it is his plan, because God has told us that homosexuality is sinful, and not part of his design.	24
0	It was an admission D3 made.	24
0	Have you considered letting go of religion altogether, and just focussing on living a good life? Deep down, you know there isn't anything wrong with premarital sex, it's just an outdated belief. You aren't harming anyone in doing so. Don't care about it!	24

0	It is more important to help those they are harming than it is to be nice to the people doing the harm. People who spew hate should be stood against. Sometimes you have to do that before being nice.	24

0	How did this pro-homosexuality post by a non-Christian get 119 upvotes when most submissions to this sub have less than 20? Makes you think.  Meanwhile, homosexual acts are still a sin, homosexual marriage is still invalid, and "gay" is still a co-opted word by homosexuals which properly means "happy."	24
0	They succeeded in stopping it from being publicly exhibited in their city, which was the plan. I think it would be safe to say that they never intended to destroy all copies of it forever.  &gt;giving it more free advertising  lol it had already caused an uproar. What they did was demonstrate to that their country wouldn't stand for it.	24

Hell the city I'm in won't let you work on your car for more than 7 days before they want to tow it out of your driveway. This is in the heartland/bible belt of America.	24
0	No, it's clearly not stealing and God explicitly condones such actions in the Bible. You're grasping at straws here.	24

0	/ Just a false teacher, that much is clear./  - false teacher? funny! just answer my question,   does this verse apply to Judas?  Hebrews 6:4  4 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, 5 And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, 6 If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.  unless you do not know the meaning of the word " impossible"?	24
0	That's your moral judgement to make, but it certainly gave me a very positive impression of French Christians.	24
0	well I'm glad you clarified as for some people, as the Book is explicitly clear on the views of The Father on the matter	24
0	/ Why would my church need to approval of a lying false teacher? Answer: It doesn't./  - wise decision, because once you disclose it here, you will see the truth and your church's errors.   hide it from me and make sure that i wont see that because once i found it, you church will be the next topic.   but wise decision brothermarcos, if i were you, i will also hide it to be safe.	24

1	Super mature way to handle that. I'm sure he'll go and reassess his values now.	27
1	Isn't it weird how when a woman is filming something like this there is always a ton of pointless screaming and "OH MY GODDDD" and this guy doesn't even get up he just goes "Hey chill." All calm.	27
1	It's possible because this isn't about truth. It has NEVER been about truth. It is about feminist politics. You and I, as men, are automatically wrong, and automatically criminals if they accuse us of something--- just because a woman accused a man the man is guilty. That's how this sort of thing happens.	27
1	Black women think with anger.	27
1	Kicking someone while they're down is kind of the antithesis of justice.   /r/I'm14andthisisjustice	27
1	/r/im14andthisisfunny material from a mod? o_O	27
1	Damn, one of our mods has an extra chromosome.	27
1	If you say so buddy.	27
1	I can't get it to play, is it because I'm on mobile?	27
1	thats because i was lazy and pulled items off the front page of PPD  Edit: Since my examples we're apparently bad, [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/comments/3240w5/men_are_dogs_xpost_runexpected/), [Are](http://www.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/comments/2t1idx/i_was_kidding_pls_dont_im_just_a_girl_pls/), [Some](http://www.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/comments/31y2l8/sarah_silverman_claims_unequal_pay_for_being_a/), [With](http://www.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/comments/2kgn6c/woman_breaks_up_with_her_boyfriend_of_10_months/), [More](http://www.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/comments/2lgdfy/nah_bitch/), [Upvotes](http://www.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/comments/2v98c2/pussy_pass_finally_denied_woman_jailed_after_11th/) .

1	Thats how it allways hapens in teh movies!	27
1	you actually might be a retard	27
1	I think the guy is Tate, I heard "Hey Tate chill"	27
1	It's not racist if it's true. It's like 98% true. Grew up in New Orleans and how live in Houston. It's true.	27
1	Just found this sub and have been enjoying it a lot.  So disappointed that they let children become moderators.	27
1	Kicking someone while they're down = dickhead pass approved, regardless of gender	27
1	Dont forget she was already starting to walk away as if she won the battle lol	27
1	I mean even so this just sounds fucking crazy, they literally arrested a guy for 2 god damn months based on a rape claim from a crazy person with a history of false rape claims.  And then refused to look at the evidence showing he was innocent.  What's going to happen in the next 10 years? just going to get thrown in jail for 5 years every time a woman says you raped her?  Jesus christ man this is just getting out of control, feminists and their bullshit fake stats and victim complex are just ruining the education and justice systems.	27
1	Don't know shit about the Japanese and Chinese, Scandinavians, or Turkish. Now that I'm reflecting on it, I do know and have a lot of experience with black people it's weird. It's true what they say - actual Africans are like completely different. Very polite and caring.	27
1	So, uh, what? What did he do on this sub?  All I see is you calling him names and a racist, but there's nothing in this post to back it up. A mod should know how to make better posts... seriously...	27
1	She also can't take rejection it seems..	27
1	Had to read that twice, I thought the funny thing was the banned guys reaction, but as far as I can tell, the MOD said all those horrible things... am I reading that correctly?	27
1	It's socially expected for men not to hit women. To ignore this fact would be pretty stupid when looking at behavior like this.	27
1	Shouldn't throw tea in the first place.	27
1	no, but as a reflex i could see myself doing the same thing. he didnt punch her, he pushed her away and she fell.	27
1	Calm down buddy, it will be alright.	27
1	Does anyone have another link? The one OP posted doesn't work.	27
1	I also I thought he was just showing the banned guy's retarded response.  It's the kind of angry outburst I expect from from someone who just got banned. Then I realized it was the mod.	27
1	Tha.. Man, fuck you!	27
1	If I told someone to stop bugging me, and had tea thrown on me as a result, yeah I'd be ok with shoving them. Gender is a non-factor. You really think no one would be ok with a doucheprick of a man doing the same thing getting shoved? What color is the sky in your world?	27
1	He's a grammar Nazi giving wrong advice. He didn't even capitalise "Christ" which is a name and therefore should be capitalised, nor did he put quotation marks around his quote. Also, his use of ellipsis at the beginning of his second sentence makes no sense.   "Should have went" is just fine.	27
1	Agh it makes my heart warm and happy when I see this	27
1	Yeah I don't know, the wage gap has been debunked so many times I'm not sure how it's still a part of feminism.  Kind of says a lot about a movement when every issue they bring up is debunked and proven bullshit.	27
1	Eh, I feel that there isn't a lot of mercy for women who pull shit like this. Which is good.	27
1	Here's a mirror: https://twitter.com/charleneandrea_/status/593959499137953793	27
1	I think the second time was even funnier man. Nice memes bro!	27
1	Fuck yes. What would you do?	27
1	Warms the heart to see the child killers so distraught.  I hope their time inside is consumed with the haunting fear that any given day someone inside might learn what they're in for and do to them what the judge could not.	27
1	And he can smash that with the power of 1000 suns after that.  crazy i know	27
1	[I knew saving this was a good idea](http://i.imgur.com/IdHDAEM.png)	27
1	How is this comment relevant at all? The double standard is correct. Had a man came at a bouncer several times with his shoes none the less, he would've been sleeping. It wouldn't even mattered if it was a small dude á la Woody Allen.	27
1	She still got the pass because, even though her allegations were demonstrably false, she was not charged with filing a false or malicious report.	27
1	Sadly, she was let off after apologizing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEcvPhP4tqc	27
1	This^ Is why I didn't upvote this post, pussypassdenied and pussypassgranted	27
1	not a PPD. gratifying but she didnt try to use her gender as a defense	27
1	I'm not a big fan of anyone abusing their power because they don't like someones attitude. It's the same a cop assaulting a person for recording them.	27
1	Except there was no pussy pass to begin with. Where did she tried to use her gender to her advantage?	27
1	You're so tough, please don't hurt me.	27
1	I apologize you are correct this video doesn't belong here.	27
1	She had a 10k bond for posession of a personal amount of xanax, the judge deserved a finger.	27
1	It's more like /r/Justiceporn	27
1	Sometimes this sub just saddens me. Yeah this girl is dumb as a sack of rocks and she has shit manners, but this judge should not be able to charge her 5000 dollars for saying "Adios" which is litterally exactly what the judge said but in spanish.   The same goes for flipping him off, yes it's rude and incredibly offensive and incredibly stupid to do such a thing but honestly he just gave her some serious bull shit and he probably deserved worse.  There is no justice here, no pussy pass denied, just a judge on a power trip over a ditzy chick.	27
1	For what? It all started because she said adios. She wasn't even bitchy about it. You guys are being emotional.	27
1	I agree. Offending someone in power is not a criminal act, and treating it as such is a gross abuse of that power. I don't care what gender you are.	27
1	So? It's not against the law to do either of those things.   You're just experiencing an emotional reaction. She irritated you so you're glad she got fucked. Don't pretend it had anything to do with justice, though.	27
1	"You have zero to offer in ideas or talent to build a sub to 47k. So you slam on us that do."  Last time I checked the people of reddit are what build subs up not mods. We post most of the content you just came up with a good topic a while ago. There has been no modifications to the look and functionality of this sub.  You do have something going here and could have well more than 47k in subscribers if you knew how to mod correctly.	27
1	Dude, that judge was a dick. $5000 more because she said adios?	27
1	I'd say just by being all cutesy and shit.  The pussy pass is rarely used as a clear 'I'm a girl, please let me go' type of thing.	27
1	The stupid xanax law is wasting the court's time, not her.	27
1	I watched this happen the other day on a episode of 20/20, there was a 20 something woman on a jury and she believed that a 17 year old girl was defending herself from being raped. The 17 year old claimed she killed the guy because he was trying to rape her and the woman believed it, even though there were no defensive wounds, scratches, bruises or evidence of a attempted rape. One guy had to reminder her that there was no evidence of this attempted rape, that the girl was seen all over the guy in a bar and that she had stabbed the dude 60 times and that is not self defense.	27
1	This subreddit has gone to crap with /r/redpill antiwoman bullshit	27
1	That it has. Watch us get downvoted for being SJW's or white knights or some shit.	27
1	I'm in total agreement with you guys.  She wasn't using her gender so no pussypass.	27
1	/r/nopussypasshere. No stupid mods like here.	27
1	What an amazing video and the music is top shelf.	27
1	&gt; They beat a toddler to death with a belt and plastic coat hangers  Came to the comments for story. I wish I didn't, those fucking animals.	27
1	Man, that was a fucking solid punch.  He probably really *did* break that bitch's jaw.	27
1	One of my all time favorites.	27
1	read this palm you gypsy bitch	27
1	Not sure if that beats the 8-ball. Long arms and a big windup.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg2wMhE0xM4	27
1	The way she cries after getting hit always getting me.Blah blah blah....bam!...wahhhhhhhhhhh!	27
1	A bit of context: Apparently she was a Romanian teacher accused of beating her young students and the cop was there to arrest her, I guess she didn't like that and the barely functioning side of her brain decided slapping a cop is a good idea	27
1	Every single person in this was annoying as fuck	27
1	Get inside before dark you Transylvania hoe!	27
1	She got a 5000 dollar fine for saying good bye in spanish. How the fuck is that reasonable? Flipping off a judge is not a smart response but i'd say its sort of substantiated given the context...  It's like you didn't even read what I said... white knighting.... yeah ok...  Sorry I don't think somebody should be taxed for being an idiot/ignorant, I mean she doesnt even have a lawyer to guide her.	27
1	If a dude did that he would get sex offender treatment, or at least an eval for it.	27
1	god that was frustrating to watch. Its like watching yourself try and fight in a dream.	27
1	Jesus, who wrote that article? They are encouraging people to put dick in crazy	27
1	Crazy bitches like this give stoners a bad name	27
1	She may be crazy as fuck, but I'll be damned if she isn't hot as hell.	27
1	Is that any less rediculous? She probably didn't even have 500 dollars worth of Xanax on her. She stated she makes 200 a week, that would be half a year of pay and 10k is a full year. The way we deal with drug posession in the US is fucking outrageous.	27
1	Looks like the guy on the scooter picked up stuff that was dropped, put it down the back of his pants, and took off.	27
1	She's not that hot. She's like a 7.5	27
1	Pretty sure if a guy does this he's a felon, good to see same standards.	27
1	She a Midwest 9.	27
1	I've said it before, I'll say it again, regardless of race or gender, don't hit unless you're prepared to get hit. Simple. Fuck a pussy pass.	27
1	And if you stuck your dick in that crazy bitch she would scream rape one nanosecond after she sobered up.  I would pepper spray her.	27
1	NOW white knight wants ppl to chill.	27
1	Holy shit. This video is even better now that I know that.	27
1	First this isn't /r/pussypass it's /r/pussypassdenied. Also if this had been a guy or an unattractive girl everyone would say they got what they deserved but it's some hot chick so of course the guy is a faggot for calling the cops.	27
1	You know you fucked up when the guy quickly adjusted his glasses in a calm and collect manner.	27
1	Who, the girl or the guy?  ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)	27
1	"Let me just compose myself so that I can SLAP THE SHIT OUT OF YOU"	27
1	She got lucky that they didnt find her PCP.   No fucking way she acted that way on just weed.	27
1	I can't help but imagine how this article would read if the roles were reversed. Somehow I doubt they'd mock the 20 year old sorority girl for not having sex with a guy who broke into her apartment, stripped naked on the bed, and began asking her if she thought he was pretty. And they surely wouldn't refer to her as a "victim" in a pejorative tone like the did to the male in the article. It's pretty lame of them for ridiculing a man who was being responsible and decided not to put up with crazy's bullshit.	27
1	This man is a genius. He knew damn well, ESPECIALLY in a college setting, that it would a terrible move to fuck her. It would only take her a second to cry rape and his life would be ruined. He quickly called 911 so there would be no questions of 'he said, she said,' no chance she could change the story. One nut burst is not worth having your life ruined.	27
1	Hey I gotta tell you - if I were single and some hot young naked chick ran into my room yelling 'I LOVE MARIJUANA!'... i'd be fucking tempted.	27
1	he slapped her back to childhood.	27
1	No scooter dude came back you can see the yellow sticking out towards the end of the video lmao	27
1	Retard of the thread Award goes to you.	27
1	Agree, 8-ball deserves his own category in the Nobel Prizes.	27
1	A 16-year-old who has never touched a tit.	27
1	&gt;It would only take her a second to cry rape and his life would be ruined.  But the patriarchy!	27
1	Some people are really stupid, and use weed use (just like people use being drunk) as an excuse to act like who they really are at their core: a stupid idiot. But they can blame it on the drug and absolve themselves of any responsibility for being a dumb person.	27
1	She actually ran in and yelled "Am I pretty?!", according to the article, but I can see your point.	27
1	The guy who wrote that is a pathetic embarrassment to his employer. I've blacklisted the website.	27
1	Yep. The effect of alcohol is *highly* culture dependent. People act the way they see drunk people act in movies and in real life. They're playing out a role that's expected of them. The same is likely true for other drugs like weed.  (PMS fits this category as well)	27
1	"You are ugly and you smell like shit" is the only proper response to that question, under the circumstances.	27
1	Yeah the mental illness is being 19 and seeing alcohol for the first time	27
1	And you be out of school with rape charges. It's not the old days anymore.	27
1	Have these people never been around incoherently drunk college girls? There is nothing more annoying. It isnt hot, and I dont have the patience for that shit.	27
1	WoW... you must be proud of yourself???	27
1	Those shitlords are oppressing that strong, independent womyn by shaming her sexuality!	27
1	So you're sayin' it's working and should continue?	27
1	&gt;oh you find it a fucking joke do you?  yes, yes we do	27
1	-Patrice O'Neal  gone too soon	27
1	During the interview with the officer:  &gt;Officer: do you think she was able to consent?  &gt;Defendant: no man, she was too wasted  It was an interview and he volunteered that information. By his own admission, she was too messed up to consent.   I don't take the ruling lightly. It was a tough case all around.	27
1	Not at all. I didn't sleep well for the two days it was going on. But the guy had sex with a woman who was nearly passed out coming down on meth. I was just reinforcing the dangers of having sex with people under the influence. Its a grey area.	27
1	&gt; One nut burst is not worth having your life ruined.  This is how people with kids tell me how living with kids is like.	27
1	The whole article reeks of double standards. A guy doing this would end up on the sex offenders list before he even reaches the station for processing. Something tells me she'll get away with probation and a stern "don't do that again! ^^Unless ^^it's ^^my ^^house..." from the judge..	27
1	Here's the full vid on LL  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=8f8_1430069544   What's so fucking annoying is the chavy White Knight cunt and the fact she started lying about the taxi man hitting her just because she disagrees with the guy, so she lies to try and get a bunch of men to fuck him because she disagrees.  Good to see that she is being investigated though, I watched this and was like nothing will happen her.	27
1	She looks pretty average to me.	27
1	I don't understand.  She made advances on him and *he's* going to jail for it?  If I drive drunk, am I the victim of the car?  After all, I was under the influence -- even though I made the decision to drive.  The car merely went along with it.  Wait.  Is ***that*** why they put my car in impound?	27
1	Standards:  there are two of them.	27
1	Ah, yes, the "it was satire" defense.   I'd still assume the writer was sincere	27
1	Yeah its pretty obvious this stupid ass chick saw the car from behind and thought "gotcha" and then was to stubborn to back down when she realized the car was crashed and not driveable. Glad to see she got what she deserved.	27
1	Except kids can disappoint you more than jail can.  Just ask my parents.	27
1	Good idea. Until she calls the cops on your for 'spying' without consent and you become known as the 'pervy' 'creepy' campus peeping-tom. Remember, they made the rules so you can't win.	27
1	Good thing North Arizona University isn't in Texas.	27
1	AFAIK its a japanese urban legend.  Basicly its a woman with a slashed up mouth, ear to ear grin, who constantly wears a hospital mask, she would walk up to pretty children and ask them if she looked pretty.  If you said no you die.  If you said yes, she would rip the mask off and show you her real face, while repeating the question.  Say no and you die, say yes and she  slashes your mouth so it looks just like hers before leaving you for dead.	27
1	Cunt throws a rock and a bottle, still gets away with only a punch.	27
1	Yeah! And, make sure you document the whole thing on video camera... you know, as evidence?	27
1	the video its talking about was posted in pussypass due to how the whiteknight in the vid rushed in to "defend" her when the camera man was defending himself, this is a follow up.	27
1	I wish someone would've knocked that beached whale out, she was annoying as fuck.	27
1	PPD pending but inevitable (hopefully)	27
1	would these girls be charged with criminal conspiracy charges at a federal level.	27
1	Also I love how he crushes the white knight for dessert.	27
1	You know they wont .	27
1	&gt;As for why the girls would make the abuse allegations up, Kost's lawyer says the goal was to "Take revenge for him being a player."&gt;   haters goina hate	27
1	When I started to read this, I thought "How could anyone be this evil?"  &gt; "We should sacrifice him to Satan."  Welp, had a good laugh	27
1	Not to mention when he was/is in jail he could've been raped himself or molested for being a rapist.	27
1	Probably not.  They are young and female.  If there is a single charge brought against them I will be shocked.  At best he will be let out without even an apology.	27
1	I imagine a civil suit will follow once he is exonerated.	27
1	Too late anyway the kids life is ruined.	27
1	I'd go John Wick on those bitches.	27
1	"Women have been humiliated in the media for far too long..."    I'm sorry,  have you not watched like... Every show ever? Why is no one talking about that famous prison scene in sons of anarchy? Or male rape scenes in Spartacus? Or Basically 90% of the violence on TV. There's a video out there called 100 movies 100 headshots, there's only 2 females in the video. Tell me more about how you're being humiliated, fucking tell me!	27
1	Cut their fucking heads off.. useless cunts.	27
1	"The Pinal County Attorney also issued a brief statement on the case saying, "Tyler Kost is presumed innocent unless proven guilty."  Then why the fuck is he in jail?!	27
1	If he is freed he could bring a civil suit against all of them and if they are minors the families would have to pay out. There could be a serious amount of compensation for this if 13 families were each sued.   Also I truly believe that if found innocent he could press charges against each of them.	27
1	So we should just jail everyone who has been accused of a violent crime before proving that they are actually the culprit?   Also, with murder there is a dead person, meaning that someone did commit a crime. In the case of rape, however, there is no conclusive proof any crime was committed at all.	27
1	Yes but it's funny to rape men. Not to mention expected if you go to prison.	27
1	True, it's not a real crime like raping a woman.	27
1	This is too extreme. First of all they aren't useless cunts, but if we cut their heads off after like a day or so they will be.	27
1	I believe evidence at the time is taken into consideration and how good your lawyer is, that is looked at when you are waiting to be granted bail.  I think it's actually innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt, people sometimes leave out that last part.	27
1	He still can (given he is released and proven innocent). These girls knowingly lied to put him behind bars. If he is raped in prison, the prosecutor of these women could feasibly try them as rapists because their false testimony put him in that situation (given the state law allows that).	27
1	His life has already been ruined so they got what they wanted.	27
1	He should sue those cunts for millions of dollars and every single one of them should get at least the same amount of sentence than he did. But i can fucking guarantee justice is going to happen because all of them will get a major pussypass.	27
1	How was he found guilty with no evidence?	27
1	Ugh. The red pill.	27
1	A girl tried this shit on me once. We had consensual drunken sex and three weeks later she called it in. She declined a physical rape test and didn't get a lawyer. It was thrown out quickly because of my co operation, honesty- im joking that didnt help. My lawyer did his job well. And i couldnt sue her for false claims because the lawyer didnt want to have feminists picket his office. He didnt say that, but thats what i got from his answer.	27
1	I agree with that but just curious, do you say that because you think they shouldn't?	27
1	He spent a year in jail already for not doing a single God damn thing. This isn't a pass denied, this is a pass granted. Those girls will face NO jail time. Considering the horrors and life long damage of jail, those whores should be in jail for twice the time he was. Stupid cunts. Even then they didnt' spend time in jail as a "rapist".	27
1	/u/Nezzatic fucked a pig. That's illegal, lets jail him.	27
1	If I were falsely accused, I would be in jail for murder. If I'm going to jail, I'm going to jail for a reason. I'd much rather spend 10 year in jail as a murderer than even a month as a rapist.	27
1	He can absolutely file a civil suit. Don't be pedantic, jackass.	27
1	I hate the fact that most people think of the analogy of the Red Pill meaning anti-women shit, when it started as people seeking the truth.	27
1	They should . But at the most they'll get reprimended in front of a juge all because they're women .	27
1	teenage girls all agree on everything because they are more likely to take social cues than to have their own opinions  most of rebellious teenagers are boys, the girls usually follow an existing way of being "rebellious" which is by definition not rebellious, but just joining an existing subculture	27
1	IANAL, or anywhere near one, but couldn't you argue that the Facebook data crossed state lines?	27
1	Feels &gt; reals	27
1	This is why we need feminism!!!	27
1	Unless he sues them all and gets millions for defamation of character. Even if he is found innocent, the fact that he was tried for rape will hurt if not destroy his chances of landing a decent career. That sounds reasonable for a large monetary compensation.	27
1	Tagging you as Pig fucker.	27
1	Midwest girls are fat and farmers.	27
1	hard out here for a pimp	27
1	&gt;What's so fucking annoying is the chavy White Knight cunt and the fact she started lying about the taxi man hitting her just because she disagrees with the guy, so she lies to try and get a bunch of men to fuck him because she disagrees.  Welcome to the world of using the Victim Narrative as a means of inciting Social Aggression and proxy violence.	27
1	I heard you fucked a pig. That's illegal. I'm calling the cops.	27
1	Hahaha because if you punish them real rape victims will be afraid to come forward so punishing them is the same as punishing rape victims. It's logic.	27

1	If thirteen girls were raped, do you honestly think not one of them would have came forward when it happened. I can understand a few being scared or something. But thirteen. I mean come on you sound retarded.	27

1	His family should make sure everyone remembers these girls.  10 years from now, they claim they were attacked in college, be right there to tell the judge what they did.  The boy shouldn't be the only one suffering life-long consequences.	27
1	&gt;If you had reasonable suspicion that i did such a thing  That's not how our justice system works.	27
1	I hope no one here is holding on to that 'equality' dream  Poor bastard	27
1	RICO has no requirements that a crime occurs across state lines, you pretty much just made that up...  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act	27
1	It's funny that feminists harp on and on about how strong and independent women are yet they think false rape accusers should be let off the hook because women aren't strong enough to come forward if some of them are liars. Where's the logic in that? Wait nvm, it's feminism, no logic required.	27
1	Woah woah woah. We don't know that you didn't though. I mean, can you imagine if a pig fucker were allowed to walk before his trial, and he just kept on fucking pigs? You can't treat one differently, after all. Some wise pigfucker on the internet told me that.	27
1	"We need to teach men not to rape!"  *deafening sound of limp-wristed applause*  "We need to teach women not to abuse the legal system as a form of petty revenge!"  *glass shatters as thousands of women hiss in unison*	27
1	Yeah he could, and he might win. He also might find a unicorn that talks and gives out wishes. You never know.	27
1	The existence of penis is the act of rape.	27
1	Some people always say that punishing women who make false allegations will discourage real victims from reporting.  Not punishing false allegations are stopping people from reporting.  I wouldn't report, support or give evidence against someone accused of rape - or to support a woman who claims she was raped. As the system exists, women are praised for reporting and go unpunished when they lie.  I won't help them, even if that means some real victims go without justice. If you want me to support a system, make it fair.	27
1	The thing is that you don't even need to stick your dick in crazy. It's fucking frightening how easy it is for women to ruin a mans life forever - no proof is needed, just a convincing story...	27

1	women have more rights than men, so no, they could have murdered him and paraded his severed head in the streets but if they cry in front of a male judge or yell 'feminism' to a female judge they will be released with a pardon, maybe some community service if the judge had something icky for breakfast, and feminists around the world will rejoice.	27
1	Where's the denial? She assaulted someone and was free to go? This shit just makes me angry. All those females claiming "You don't hit a women!"  Well then don't hit a man for fucks sake!!!   And I bet my life they just let them cunts walk out the store like they were correct. Even after trying to shoplift.	27
1	No, the US is supposed to use "innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt" for all criminal cases.  A slick enough lawyer can get a jury to forget that, and juries are often in a rush to convict if the accusation is rape, but it is SUPPOSED to be innocent until proven guilty.	27
1	My guess? Excessive bail.	27
1	He's not your buddy, bro.	27
1	Hes not your bro, pal.	27

1	He's not your m8, guy.	27
1	"Why  are you guys hitting her? you don't hit a lady." umm fuck that you stopped actin like a lady and started acting like a rude bitch now were going to treat you like one.	27
1	Not necessary. It could've been a coerced rape where the girl felt pressure to say have sex even if no other harm was done. Sup being such a smooth manipulative rapist.	27
1	"MAYBE SHE'LL FUCK ME IF I TAKE HER SIDE ON...WHATEVER IT IS SHE NEEDS!"    next white knight I see out drinking is losing teeth.	27
1	Yeah. Of course we need a 'vagina' for rape. No vagina, no rape. Easy. Fucking logic.	27
1	OK that second female got straight annihilated. First chick was being a asshole about it but damn that assbeating on girl #2 was uncalled for as fuck.	27
1	Ah yes, the whiteknight's mortal enemy, the blackknights.	27
1	damn this whole video was crazy	27
1	We dont know the whole backstory and she was mouthing off pretty badly behind the camera. It did seem pretty cold of her to punch her like that but just like the woman said she told her to leave plenty of times and they literally just forcefully dragged out someone else they were just telling this to. What did she expect?	27
1	If someone specifically says "I am going to punch you if you dont move" and you don't move or even turn around then I wouldn't really call that a sucker punch.  Hell  it was just plain stupid to not turn around to someone who says they are going to punch you.	27
1	I did notice the fat , blonde, ghetto trophy wife ain't even motherfuckin' playin'!	27
1	&gt; she was walking away  But she wasn't that was why she got hit. Watch the video again, she stopped going down the stairs and just stands there barely moving even after being threatened. She basically said "if you dont move now I will punch you" and that barely made her move her foot forward. It looked like she was moving slow on purpose because they were telling her to go.  Plus she was behind the camera earlier running her mouth too, people here seem to gloss that over.	27
1	http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sucker+punch  Basically it says a sucker punch is an unannounced punch. How can you not expect to be punched when someone specifically says "I will punch you"?  It was cold as ice and I don't agree with it but it definitely ain't no sucker punch. If we go with the specific definition you are still wrong.	27
1	That was a trap house. Almost 100% guaranteed. Girls were fucked up, didn't want to leave, got kicked out.	27
1	You and I clearly differ on what constitutes a trophy.	27
1	Could you shill any harder?	27
1	"You can become a member of the red pill"  Lol, this dude trying to commercialize the red pill, selling shirts and shit too. I'm all for some of the ideals behind "red pill" but it's been taken to cringeworthy levels.  Otherwise good video.	27
1	I get that she's pissed and all, but she's not using her vagina to further any agenda or use as a handicap. She's just mad that schools like to cash in on diversity whereas she was a straight academic shooter.  At my university, faculty openly talked about acceptance criteria leaning towards minority and diverse students vs straight intellect.	27
1	How is this pussypassdenied? The girl got upset like most college-bound kids who get rejected from a school that they were particularly set on (Ivy league or not), and then she created a satire piece. I actually think she handled it really well and I found it amusing.	27
1	wow she said her parents gave up on parenting her?  girl, go fuck yourself.	27
1	He's not your chief, friend.	27
1	true red pillers breathe fire and shit lightning	27
1	Right now. This very second. they are in jail. 20 fucking years from now they will be in jail. They deserve the death sentence.	27
1	What was she thinking? After he missed the first punch, she should of bailed. Biology &gt; galantry. A guy who's willing to punch you is going to knock you the fuck out. Just bail, everyone wins.	27
1	[Please, tell me more about how difficult your life is in a first world country as a woman.](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/PwCc3rArsAw/maxresdefault.jpg)	27
1	Exactly! This could never have the adverse effect of showing women they can group up and ruin a mans life without fear of serious legal consequence! It's not like we're seeing more cases of women falsely accusing men of rape because of this.... Nooooo....	27
1	&gt; Where's the denial? She assaulted someone and was free to go? This shit just makes me angry. All those females claiming "You don't hit a women!" Well then don't hit a man for fucks sake!!! &gt;   The denial was she hit him and he blasted her right back in the face and kicked her in the ass. Usually the pussypass extends to being able to strike a male without fear of reprisal. Look how stunned she was that he hit back shes completely outraged.	27
1	The real crime here is the guy filming in portrait.	27
1	I'd punch anyone who made me deaf too.	27
1	take your pick: tinnitus or deafness (or both sometimes)	27
1	I think you're looking way too hard into this to make it fit here. She seems like she's laughing at the fact she's doing something funny and at the guy's reaction	27
1	i dont think the guy really knew what he was doing though it was just a defensive reaction. so its not like he said "fuck this im still hitting her even though shes a girl!" the guy didnt mean to punch anybody.	27
1	"Prank."  I don't think that word applies when it results in permanent physical trauma like hearing loss.	27
1	Misogyny is an inaccurate way to describe what happened in the gif. The prankee doesn't have a problem against women. He has a problem with shitty pranks. He would have equally clonked a male	27
1	No wonder Reddit is filled with these SJW and feminazi types.	27
1	Found the original video, looks pretty fake - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GizCIkvAA-k	27
1	In order to deny the pass, one must present it. It was not presented, so it cannot be denied.	27
1	That's definitely a pre-recorded soundboard airhorn you hear in a waka flocka song. I agree. Fake.	27
1	Don't really see how this is PPD... Just a sad situation all together.	27
1	*sigh*... not PPD material.	27
1	Yeah.  Nowhere do I see that she tried pulling this because she's a woman.	27
1	This sub is slowly truning into "Women gets punnished"	27
1	You're misassuming the desire here is rehabilitate her rather than punish her.  She got 24 years- she took far more than that from her victims.  Rehabilitation is not the goal.	27
1	This sub has gone to shit.	27
1	This really belongs in /r/stopdrinking.	27
1	Not sure if trolling- imprisoning someone for 20 years for a dimebag of pot fulfills your example- killing people, child molesters, that kinda stuff- my outrage at their imprisonment is significantly less	27
1	I'm confused about the "The 22-year-old had drunk two large margaritas from "fishbowl size" glasses - despite being under the legal drinking age" part.       22? Under the legal drinking age?	27
1	This. The goal is to deter others from making the same decisions. This is as much about prevention as it is rehabilitation.	27
1	She's currently 22 and was 20 at the time of the accident.	27
1	You're right, we should let all killers go and make them pinky promise not to do it again.	27
1	Look at you, you little social justice warrior you.	27
1	Usually getting the pass to usually getting equal treatment feels like the pass is denied. Being woman and irresponsible is commonplace being those things and getting punished is not so much.	27
1	OH I see now; I read it as happening in 2014, not 2013. Thanks fam.	27
1	Every day I feel like I am reporting a new submission for not fitting into the sub. A woman being punched in the face with no additional context isn't PPD. Neither is a girl killing her friends in a DD incident.	27
1	Comments like this are lame, no one cares you are leaving so you don't have to announce it. Just hit the button and leave.	27
1	I love her utterly shocked face when he finally punches her....bitch you just threw a brick and attempted to bottle him da fuq you think was going to happen?	27
1	Wow... This woman should be charged with kidnapping or something... Thats insane	27
1	Fuck that cunt, gay or not they deserve the kid under contractual law.	27
1	this is what judges are supposed to be, fair and understanding to both sides.  Literally impartial.	27
1	it took them a whole year after the birth to get their child back? how fucked up	27
1	The dude might have been looking out for his friend, from the looks of things they were in a school and most schools, in the US at least, have zero tolerance on fighting. Then again he could have been white knighting, we don't know enough from this video.	27
1	"...a true red piller..."    Come on dude.	27
1	So your logic tells you that not knowing everything there is about the 'Dred Scott Decision' is an indication of a complete 'lack of education'? Fuck off dude.	27
1	Not really PPD but will leave it for now and see what the community says.   i do not know the back story to this case. Maybe someone else can shed some light.  5 years for a life is to little if you ask me.	27
1	They weren't the ones who ran him down, it was some other guy who was driving. So they didn't get murder charges, only conspiracy to commit a hate crime charges since they did nothing to stop the driver.	27
1	I don't exactly see the PP here. They committed a murder, didn't try to say they should be fine because they are woman, and they got charged.  Seems like /r/justiceporn to me.	27
1	Why the hell are they censoring the word "nigger" in the context of testimony?  Has it really gone this far?	27
1	it is top post there currently.	27
1	Stahp pls, it's not PC! /s	27
1	They arent cops so they didnt get away with it	27
1	Because it was racially motivated? They were hunting black people, not people.	27
1	Because we are not adult enough to handle mouth noises.	27
1	the pigeon flew in and i was like "HOLY SHIT THATS A BIG BIRD!"...then i realized it was just a lot closer to the camera	27
1	Being an accomplice to a crime still gives you some responsibility for the crime.	27
1	If you read the article you'll see that they encouraged it and rallied for people to join them on their trip to assault black people. They deserve the jail time.	27
1	That was very interesting. Thank you.	27
1	Aww, she said she has to live with the memory of his face day and night. I hope his face haunts her for the rest of her miserable fucking life. Stupid fucking cunts	27
1	From what I read, this doesn't belong here. She wasn't using her "womanhood" to gain any sort of extra influence or gain special privileges.   She simply was a person who was black-mailing another person.  This belongs in /r/justiceserved more than anything.	27
1	I don't care if it's a true story or not. I would watch the shit out of that movie.	27
1	Yes, and no. I've had many a girl try to hit me. Drunk women aren't very coordinated though so it's easy to dodge. Fuck that bitch in the video though. What a cunt.	27
1	he did it right. she started and got put down. good job	27
1	equal rights, equal fights	27
1	He tried to walk away and she wasn't smart enough to let him, oh well.	27
1	51% inspired. lol	27
1	Well that didn't look fake at all	27
1	Bitches be believing their own hype. Hype swiftly shut down bitch.	27
1	Can you imagine that teachers life? jesus it must be hell to be surrounded by people that don't give two shits about themselves. much less someone trying to help them.	27
1	Most of the time, the teacher will get into more trouble intervening when students are fighting than just sitting there letting it happen. If they even lay a hand on a student, it's a lawsuit that could ruin the teacher's career.	27
1	Ample warning, plenty of chances to turn back, she got what she got.	27
1	&gt;"What the fuck is wrong with you."   That's the age-old question, isn't it?	27
1	You have obviously never been in a school like this. There is no point. They will just ignore him. He can't touch them and they know it. So in their mind, why listen to him?	27
1	"I don't get paid enough for this shit"	27
1	That teacher's face. Hamstrung by a system that empowers kids to act like animals.	27
1	The system does not empower teachers in these situations, it punishes them for intervening.	27
1	I love the teacher just sitting there like idgaf	27
1	Can anybody understand anything they are saying? Do they understand each other? What language is this? What century is it?	27
1	Health and safety policy most likely. If two kids wanna kick the shit out of each other that's fine, nobody can sue anybody. But if a teacher is compelled to help by her job and is injured she could bring a claim against the school for not protecting her in the workplace.	27
1	I expected more from a detective.  I can't understand a damn thing except "fucks wrong wit chu"	27
1	That teacher was ready to quit her life.	27
1	Gonna have to agree with you, felt more like he wanted to keep a friend out of trouble.	27
1	What a horrible time we live in where people can sue the teacher for trying to stop a fight.	27
1	I gave up on the fight to hold the camera properly when taking video but really, how fucking hard is it to just hold the damn thing still or keep your shot in frame?	27
1	tf is that teacher supposed to do haha	27
1	There is only so much someone can take. I imagine if she never touched him he wouldn't have done anything. I bet she will never hit another guy again.	27
1	I got suspended in high school for fighting back (and winning) after a kid sucker punched me. The assistant principle said they had zero tolerance, and that if I didn't want to be suspended I should have not fought back. My dad who was obviously frustrated and on my side, asked the assist principal if he reached over the desk right now and punched him in the face, wouldn't he fight back? There was a long awkward silence before he repeated that I was still suspended. School system is full of corrupt cowards.	27
1	wat. Their homes do that.	27
1	Implying teachers get over 30k until they're well into their 60's.  And since when is education useless? Are you stupid?	27
1	equal rights, equal lefts	27
1	My girlfriend taught at a ghetto-ass beauty school, this sort of shit went on all the f'ing time. And these were grown "adults". She had no control or power to do anything when shit went down. I finally suggested she get an AirHorn &amp; ear plugs, then blast that shit when they start acting the fool. Needless to say she was too nice to follow my advice.	27
1	Care to elaborate? I went to public school and would never behave like this in class.	27
1	That's giving WAY too much credit to someone that is basically mentally challenged.	27
1	The law.  Also, some money is also not bad, but she isn't paid enough for this shit	27
1	Did you go to an inner city public school? I went to a public school too, but when the school is filled with animals its more like a zoo.	27
1	The Man did. He stood up for what he did and got just punishment. A slap on the wrist.  She acted like a cunt by fighting and will get her day.  Surprised she did not call rape.	27
1	he is talking about the dumbass girl, the guy seemed decent enough. Just because you speak differently, it doesn't mean you are an "animal" or whatever these "wow, this black person actually seemed in control of his own agency" comments are about	27
1	Yes you giant retard, anytime that anything bad happens to a woman it is "pussy pass denied". Jesus this sub is stupid as fuck lately.	27
1	I see nothing of where she tried to use her sex to gain leniency then was denied. I see where she tried to claim amnesia and got no leniency.   Did we read the same articles?	27
1	But that has nothing to do with her using her sex for an advantage, then getting it denied. She's stupid, but she didn't try to use being female to her advantage.	27
1	I think that /u/ipoopgreatness meant that kids know that they can act like wild animals in school because if a teacher dares to put their hands on them or even reprimand them it can mean their job (at the least). Even worse, this is a white teacher. At the risk of sounding like a terrible, terrible racist - white people with any kind of authority have to be very cautious when dealing with black people right now.	27
1	Let's hope this is a trend that catches on.	27
1	Rarely. Getting rid of the system all together would be a good thing.	27
1	It isn't LA.  It is the entire fucking state of California.	27
1	or you could come from a family like mine where both parents had to work to in order for the family to eat and have a roof over our heads.  The concept behind the petition is simple and equal to both sexes. Feminists want equality then they should face the facts of what equality is. Having a child does not mean you can sit on your ass for the rest of your life and have a man pay for it. get up of your ass and work.	27
1	Except homemakers are a tiny minority now, and many women want alimony even if they make just as much as the man.  In theory alimony should only be temporary until they find work, but too many just use it as a free paycheck.	27
1	I would love for someone to pay for me to stay home and take care of any kids I have. I think it's far more of a sacrifice to have to toil away at a job and consequently spend minimal time with your children.	27
1	1. If you read the whole article he's changing the alimony law to make it so that after 10 years of marriage there will be a 20% alimony for 5 years until they get back on their feet, that is plenty of time and no one should argue that it will take longer than 5 years to build a new career for yourself.  2. A lot of men don't collect alimony also, only 3% of people on alimony right now are men. That is not a lot.	27
1	Those are great arguments for reform, not abolition.	27
1	I'd like to see her try to withhold it. What a foolish sow	27
1	Great point. The homemaker can theoretically get up to the same career level as the former spouse, even without the extra years of work history.  The one who supported the homemaker, however, can NEVER get back the time they missed out on with their children.	27
1	Yes but choosing to stay at home and raise a kid is an easy fucking life, that anyone would choose over having to go to work every morning. It's not 'sacrificing a career' it's winning the fucking lottery.  You want the easy life of cleaning a man's house and raising a child, but you still want the benefits of busting your ass at work everyday. Fuck off.	27
1	But, the gold diggers. Won't somebody think of the gold diggers?...	27
1	Colorado - the only state with common sense.	27
1	all I could think about at the end:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AbjYmLIIGE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m27s	27
1	I don't think it should be ended, but it should be severely limited.  I mean, there are situations where it's somewhat warranted, but only for a short time, not the whole rest of her life.	27
1	Good luck to them alimony is bullshit	27
1	I payed my ex for three years.  She had a job and no kids.  She just wanted a really nice apartment and extra money.  I payed it and moved on, but I don't get the law.	27
1	The show pays for the rulings, a small appearance fee, and a per diem. Her saying "He'll never get it" makes no sense whatsoever.	27
1	Only 38 years? She still got aight pass a man beating a woman to death with a baseball bat would have gotten atleast 60.	27
1	It's still better than 38 days of house arrest.	27
1	Good. Bitches don't deserve a dime of a mans labor.	27
1	And now I look like a fucking idiot laughing at work, thanks.	27
1	Yeah so pretty much the one that wins will always get their money but the other person doesn't pay it, so they really don't learn anything and will prob do some stupid crap again thinking they won't be held liable.	27
1	Maybe he had an equally venomous wife that sucked him dry. I would be bitter as well.	27
1	Yeah. It's a T.V. show.	27
1	Doesn't make it any less true.	27
1	I was a little shocked when I found out how much I had to pay.  I was thinking I was going to run off free!  But, even with paying her $419/ wk I was able to get out of 20k in debt within a year, and then finally start saving.  I was living paycheck to paycheck with her.  She was sucking me dry and dragging me deeper and deeper in debt.	27
1	I thought LA stood for Louisiana......	27
1	&gt;  It was implemented for GOOD reason  It was implemented because women at the time weren't expected to work, and often *couldn't* work because they had to care for the children.  This is no longer the case. At all.  &gt; A few more of these types of posts filled with hate-speech oriented comments and I'm fuckin outa here.  Why wait?	27
1	Lot of guys don't understand this and think alimony is all bad. While in many (most?) Cases it certainly is unjust, there are still many cases in which alimony is fair, both when the man or woman is paying or receiving.  No house body (the spouse that chooses to stay home and raise children) should be cast out onto the street when things go sour. It is a joint decision for that person (in most cases) to be the stay at home parent.  They are entitled to some financial support so they can get a job and support them self.	27
1	I mean, come back to me when she's been convicted.	27
1	Sentence 2 implied that he would be bitter if hypothetical sentence 1 were true.	27
1	So you think someone who is divorced deserves the future earnings of the other spouse? That just doesn't make any sense unless in very specific contexts where the couple started a business together and only one is retaining ownership after the divorce is finalized.  That is, by definition, a sense of entitlement	27
1	No offense, but how does it get like that?  I never understood how guys get sucked into these relationships with women that are so useless and dependent on other people to support them.  Was it not a red flag when you were dating and noticed that she was unable to support herself?  How did she eat before she met you?  Again, I mean no offense to you or your ex, I just have always been interested in how these relationships happen where one person has to carry the other through life.	27
1	Holy shit man, $419 a week? That's more than I make.	27

1	At about 60k a year to house an inmate, over 2 million dollars of our money will be wasted on this worthless piece of flesh.	27
1	He did it right... And left.	27
1	Seems as if this has been investigated to death. IIRC his roommate recorded some or all of the incident in question. She's been trying to blackmail him for a piece of the action because of his fame. I don't like the guy, but seems pretty out there that someone would go through what she did and claim rape. She pretty much jumped through (sober) hoops to end up back at his place when offered alternatives. She's gold digging.	27
1	I think this is a repost (or maybe i've just seen it elsewhere) but this is a legit PPD! Seems rare around these parts as of late.	27
1	It's a civil suit.  She's not being "convicted."  He's suing her for defamation and the money she cost him in endorsements.  Realistically, he'll never see any serious money from this lawsuit, but it's a deterrent for the  next gold digger.	27
1	Yeah, you're right all around.	27
1	&gt;Welcome to /r/pussypassdenied, where women are not allowed to use their gender as a handicap or an excuse to act like assholes. Yay equality!   Just thought i'd remind you what this sub was for. You're looking for /r/publicfreakout    I see i'm being downvoted, how is this a PPD? No where does anyone mention her gender, aside from "she's crazy"	27
1	The teacher is just like "Why did I have to take the job at the fucking zoo..."	27
1	[Here's an article with more information.](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/news05/ogdensburg-woman-says-border-patrol-agent-shocked-her-with-stun-gun-video-20150509)	27
1	I think 38 is perfect. It destroys your life under any practical aspect, and gives you this realisation; then if you live long enough to get out, you'll be thrown in an unrecognisable world where you have no contacts and you are still considered an outcast so you have to spend the rest of your days isolated and without any mean to get back in a new society. It's a double sentence really.  This again implying the sjw philosophy doesn't take over and workplaces won't have to hire a minimum percentage of convicts to be socially fair or whatever.	27
1	&gt; I don’t care for anyone else, I drive where I please.  I don't speak Russian, but I googled for it and managed to find a translation on an article about an older video and from what I can see the stickers are unchanged between them.	27
1	I guarantee you this woman calls herself a feminist.	27
1	Judge mathis is a human bullshit detector with Swiss movement precision.	27
1	But... But I am a woman, why won't you let me through.	27
1	Ah, the middle aged women showing a prime example of her defense mechanism. She immediately resorts to outright ridiculous sarcasm for every single sentence she says, as she is too dimwitted to think of anything legitimate to say. Fascinating creatures.	27
1	Yeah. It must be so difficult for a fit, rich, professional athlete to land women. He obviously needs to resort to violence and rape.  Stupid shit.	27
1	Its always funny to scroll to the bottom and see white knights protecting their lady. They just can't understand that women are not as sweet as they have been told.	27
1	She also reported the unknown man who gave her a shot of liquid asked for money in exchange.  What a messed up world we live in..	27
1	She sounds like a heavy person	27
1	The police used the wrong weapon. I guess the harpoon was in the shop.	27
1	Unless you provide a source, that's a load of crap.	27
1	This is the dumbest shit I've ever seen, and I was a TA. Your questions are bullshit, your binary distinction of "sexist vs chivalrous" is completely retarded, and the questions themselves are terrible. Please put at least 30 seconds of thought into your homework before your post it on the Internet.	27
1	How is this PPD?      Could be a male jackass and have the same result.	27
1	Feminist response: He triggered her PTSD by walking away, he should have just reacted... oh wait nvm.	27
1	Not to mention it'd be filled out by angry feminists when they see it	27
1	I don't get why this is PPD. Gender had nothing to do with this other than it happened to be a girl getting tased.	27
1	I'll enjoy watching her get a large settlement while you pro-authoritarian copsuckers suck each other off over a woman having her rights violated.	27
1	"You are men. You are supposed to yield to women"  Jesus fucking Christ. These people are delusional.	27
1	But but! You mean I won't get to touch and feel and oggle after I'm done protecting milady?  But on a serious not, white knights are probably some of the most annoying people ever, just after tumblr social justice warriors.	27
1	I like how she started off calling them cool guys, then ended up talking shit about their penises and sex lives.	27
1	Isn't that how PPD works? She acted like an Asshole, and got dealt with like an Asshole, instead of being catered to because she has breasts.	27
1	There are countless videos showing idiots (both male and female) who act out of order when confronted with police.      And no, in this video there wasn't one moment where she said or referenced her gender as a tool to change how the officers dealt with her.	27
1	"Just comply and shut the fuck up."  Wow. That was an actual thing you said.	27
1	This guy held his own against those damn sweaty sloots 10/10	27
1	You do realize he has a point right? This woman did nothing wrong the only explanation those officers gave was that she "looked nervous".  She will sue, and she will win. This was nothing more than a case of police brutality.	27
1	??? Did you not listen to the video? She was being detained against her will. The female officer refused to give her an explanation on why she was being detained beyond "you looked nervous". You can't fucking detain someone based on your perceived opinion on their current emotional status. Are you fucking retarded?	27
1	i lost it at the utters	27
1	This is legendary. "You fuck greasy fuck", my god.	27
1	"Go save your sister before she accidently gets harpooned"	27
1	I laughed like a retarded seal at that part.	27
1	He had a perfectly logical argument they were both talking shit about physical features. That cow got what she asked for she has the possibility of losing weight, short guys can't get taller by running it off.	27
1	Yo that bitch got slayed	27
1	Still got the point across and was UTTERly hilarious.	27
1	this is one of my favorite posts on here.	27
1	Legen-fucking-dary! I need to buy this guy a beer	27
1	Can OP send me this guys name so I can friend him on Facebook. The guy is money.	27
1	It's not even comparable - short vs. fat. Short guys can't magically get tall, but fat chicks can put down the double cheeseburgers and hop on a treadmill. Good for that guy. Fat=ugly	27
1	I'm 6'1" but I wish I was shorter. That way I can know if the person I plan to have a serious relationship is a bitch or not.	27
1	&gt;you fucking cheeseburger dumb fat whale piece of shit  Spoken like a true poet!	27
1	&gt;People like that make me sick, are a drag on society, and are **the reason aliens won't talk to us**.  Man, I was planning on going to sleep after this last thread, but I laughed so hard I'm awake again.	27
1	&gt;Yo that bitch got **harpooned**  FTFY	27
1	I had to add some humor to that wall of text.	27
1	You mean, like the very end?	27
1	This was horribly rude. I loved every word of it.	27
1	explanation for the uncultured: most middle eastern languages read from right to left   as a lefthander, im slightly jelly	27
1	I like the sister's conclusion the guy is a virgin. She using some deductive reasoning on a whole other level. Also her evaluation of a human being's worth based on if said being ever had sex. What a scholar. She's even a nurse! I feel like if her state's nursing board ever got wind of this, it wouldn't end well for her.	27
1	I can't stand the double standard argument they ALL have against you. Like holy shit. "She can say what she wants! But you can't make fun of her!" Wtf???	27
1	I'm a fat fuck, and this was the funniest thing I read all week.	27
1	Normally, I would think you were being rather childish. Then she responded and deserved every bit of it. Bravo. That was awesome.	27
1	Somebody tell Japan to stop slaughtering whales, we've got plenty right here.	27
1	It is honestly way too easy to become a nurse. My step mom is a nurse and she is literally the dumbest person I have ever talked to.   Here are a few things I have heard her say. Keep in mind that I am very rarely around her.  1. We were talking about the moon. "I'm scared that Martians live there."  2. She said that I shouldn't watch Family Guy around my little brothers. They, as a family, watched the entire Breaking Bad series on Netflix.   3. She told me that shaving cream would give me skin cancer.	27
1	[Here's the link to the porn video, NSFW obviously](http://www.xvideos.com/video11300111/czech_casting_lucie_5334_czech720)	27
1	As a 5'7" fuck those greasy fuck.	27
1	How can the sister be a nurse and that stupid?	27
1	They need to stay away from Dairy.	27
1	Never seen that much white trash gathered in one text box.	27
1	Or the "I wanted to give you time to get back from your 2nd lunch" haha	27
1	Ditto. He's my new God.	27
1	At first I'm like 'Damn, lolz, savage.' Then I kept reading. I feel for you.	27
1	I'm 5'9 I have no sympathy for you	27
1	Only through bad habits.	27
1	Dude, I haven't laughed like this in days	27
1	Christ, do people honestly talk this way to each other on facebook?	27
1	OP you're a fucking champ.	27
1	I realize we like to watch women get their just deserts but sometimes we like to watch them get fucked too. Plus, OP's gotta deliver right?	27
1	I honestly don't think she should have been fired.	27
1	This has to be fake. It's got to be... Otherwise I don't know if I have hope for humanity anymore.	27
1	Probably not. But using the excuse that she was drugged just so she doesn't look like a sloot is the deny here for me.	27
1	Ew, mange? Disgusting.	27
1	Topics aside, this literally boils down to "You hurt my friend's feelings because she hurt your feelings. You're an asshole." How can people not see the irony in this? This could go down as an example in the dictionary of irony.	27
1	Na... Fat logic is more of a place where current fatties, former fatties, and nice guys, go to make fun of their shitty logic while offering encouraging words. The real fun is in /r/fatpeoplehate where it's specifically meant for making fun of them for being so fucking disgusting.  Fat logic is more like anti-depressants, hoping that it will help solve their problem. FPH is more like chemotherapy, hoping to just get rid of it as aggressively and quickly as possible.	27
1	Damn, that dude had no mercy.	27
1	[2edgy4me](http://i.imgur.com/cWgwzIy.png)	27
1	I'm 6'5" and wish I were shorter sometimes. Having to break out a step stool to bend a chick over the bed is a pain. 90% of my interactions with people are me staring at the top of their head. Ceiling fans are evil.	27
1	You think she'd learn from Game of Thrones that what the vertically-challenged lack in height, they double in snark.	27
1	I'm 6'4" and I agree with this dude. Fuck those shallow cunts right in their cholesterol clogged blow holes.	27
1	I think I'm ironically the only one who laughed at this.	27
1	DAMN DAT DIS MADE ME SNARF YO.	27
1	Don't people realize they're hurting their cause way more than helping it when they make up bullshit like this?	27
1	Guess you never heard of airborne cocaine.	27
1	My fucking sides. This is amazing	27
1	FPH advocates that fat people kill themselves. There are masses of people here on Reddit advocating that people kill themselves. It really troubles me that this is such widely accepted behavior.	27
1	&gt; the real fun is in /r/fatpeoplehate  I like you.	27
1	lets post that face to /r/punchablefaces	27
1	Found the butter huffer.	27
1	He came out firing on all cylinders and never stopped pulling.	27
1	Dude, butter is a trigger word for me. Don't you know I'm bulimic?  ##thinprivilege	27
1	Are yours in space as well?	27
1	You really can't imagine someone who isn't fat treating other human beings with compassion? You've gotta be fat to be kind to other people?	27
1	Her original statement was childish. I think in this case responding to childishness with more childishness worked out pretty well.	27
1	He ain't got no 6 shooter, dude has a drum.	27
1	Don't let /r/TwoXChromosomes see this.	27
1	There's just a certain point where whoever is right doesn't matter because both sides have become savages.	27

1	I am 5'4 and shit like this is hurtful :(	27
1	I'm 6' so... *habitable zone*?	27
1	Quality post, OP. What amazes me is that they're accusing the guy of a lot of things they're guilty of doing themselves! How can they not make that simple connection?	27
1	Except that it's not ironic, just dumb	27
1	They're self centered idiots.	27
1	I'm 6'1" and I too think that she is a "dumb fat whale piece of shit" as well as a cheeseburger eating fuck. I'm not even short and I still get pissed that women somehow think what she said in her status was okay. What a hypocrite POS.	27
1	&gt;FPH advocates that fat people kill themselves. There are masses of people here on Reddit advocating that people kill themselves. It really troubles me that this is such widely accepted behavior.  But...you're /u/ahhhkillitkillit...	27
1	Its amazing just how little self awareness they have.	27
1	Although he says the men rushed him, in the video you can see at least one of the women doing so as well.	27
1	"I dont eat lunch i skip it to stay thin"  https://33.media.tumblr.com/312926497822574fbcd9dca09eb1bfdb/tumblr_mpc74ytvEn1rs8hn0o1_250.gif	27
1	It isn't about the cause it is about their ego which their cause is just a means to inflate.	27
1	If white knight equates to not wanting people to get physically hurt then call me a white knight. And fail? He was charged by multiple people and not only successfully defended himself with his firearm, he did so without firing a shot. Your comment is a shitpost.	27
1	apparently the guy who debunked the story apologized and  deleted what he wrote.   http://thehoaxpolice.tumblr.com/post/57178722274/theboyofcheese-thenewavengers	27
1	Some shitlords even get themselves banned from hamplanet-apologist subreddits like /r/ShitRedditSays, /r/TwoXChromosomes, and /r/OffMyChest. Like I did...mostly on purpose :D	27
1	I got banned from /r/offmychest after my first post here. It was the first subreddit I've been banned from. Doesn't seem too important, I've never seen them on /r/all like you guys.	27
1	As is the case with most whales.	27
1	I don't think this is a PPD. I think this is just a case where a teacher was fucked just cause she got screwed. That was fun to say.  But really,  she wasn't hurting anyone.	27
1	The complete lack of self awareness	27
1	The woman wasn't being detained. She was free to go or wait along with her vehicle as stated several times by the male supervisor.	27
1	I feel like the fact that he didn't know anything about the situation and only wanted to help only goes to show that his actions were justified. Confronting a group of people of mixed genders is a far cry from posting for women's rights online.	27
1	I Got banned from offmychest for telling someone that they might could consider making their child behave rather than blaming the teacher for alienating their child during lunch time. How dare I disagree with OP though?	27
1	That really pissed me off. Everything about this. The double standards were almost painful. What a fucking hypocrite.	27
1	*What the* ***fuck*** *did you just say to me?!*	27
1	[That was disproved a long time ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism)	27
1	stop trying so hard, you might burst a vein	27
1	I completely lost it at that point. It's perfect.	27
1	being 5'2 i got a lot of that shit in public school so i take it in stride with a shit eating grin on my face	27
1	I'm 6'5". Look at the bright side, you can drive normal cars, wear normal clothes and ride amusement park rides. I have to buy all my stuff online, my clothes cost twice as much. I have to drive bigger vehicles in order to fit/be comfortable and I am too large for most amusement park rides. I also have to pay close attention to weight restrictions on things like lawn chairs, ladders and for suspension on things like 4 wheelers and motorcycles.  Do You see? Being tall ain't all that great either.	27
1	No, they don't. I've seen tons of people on there encourage them to keep eating so that they die.	27
1	It's called being a women	27
1	No they got eaten while he wasn't looking.	27
1	You have it backwards. He didn't escalate it. He has a right to film in public. They escalated by charging him. It's assault and possibly battery.	27
1	WHY WOULD YOU RAT HER OUT ! I don't know any guy that squeal	27
1	You're a fuckin' idiot.	27
1	6'1" here, no fat chicks, ever. No matter how entitled they feel to me. And if they ever bash on shorter (than me) guys, I got your back. Bro's before whales, or cows, whatever.	27
1	Jesus fucking Christ, I hope you pass out from oxygen deprivation up there on your high horse you buzz kill.	27
1	I believe that's the joke.	27
1	I feel you. This woman is out of her mind though.   What if someone told her that short people have no "cure" against their height but overweight people do? Or that she is responsible for being overweight while short people are not for being short?	27
1	WHO TOUCHED MY GUN?!	27
1	Are you... trying to win... some sort of reverse-popularity contest?  Just trying to figure it out, is all.	27
1	The exact quote is:  "Put the camera away now."  "I'm not going to do it."  "What?"  "I said I'm not going to do it."  If you want to claim for one second that not complying with the request to stop a fully legal recording of a potentially dangerous situation equates to "escalating the situation", while the opposing party executes a full on bull rush of the person recording then you need to have a mental evaluation.	27
1	I hope I never run into people like you who think that having a camera pointed at them is a form of aggression.	27
1	I do, in fact.	27
1	I preferred "Go eat a salami sandwich."	27
1	I'll start the downvote train.	27
1	FPH is a cesspool. Being obese is a bad thing for sure and people shouldn't get fucking fat but that sub is full of assholes. Even if someone is improving their self they put them down.	27
1	To be honest, at 5'4", he probably has a pretty hard time finding normal clothes as well. I'm 5"6" and pants will never be the perfect length without some hemming.	27
1	What the fuck is wrong with you?	27
1	at least you have the reason to see that you are born with your characteristic, no number of butterburgers will make you grow to 6'2".   These chunky tub-chubster butter golems should stop making seismic waves all over facebook and hit the treadmill, jesus christ. It's like a one-level logical comparison between their statements and his completely eludes him, no wonder this country has problems	27
1	Butter golems. My sides just blew up.	27
1	Probably didn't squeal on her. Some kid found it online, shared the link with a couple friends and that shit spread like wildfire. Eventually some jealous girlfriend would have found out about it and the rest is history.	27
1	I got banned simply for subscribing, I think I made maybe one comment in an FPH thread and that was all it took.	27
1	Come to FPH we have a lot more of those over there 😏	27
1	I don't think you have to be fat to think people telling others to kill themselves is a bad thing. And besides gravity will do it anyway for the hams.	27
1	&gt; Don’t you think I would have gotten in trouble with the police for making this up? Even if I went to the police and made the entire story up, the police can do a better job of working out liars than some dude on the Internet.           Of course.	27
1	911? There's a guy on facebook talking about my weight! Please help I'm in danger.	27
1	i like that these two subs came together	27
1	i'm 5'3 and I think it's pretty funny    Being short doesn't mean you get picked last for gym class. First of all, the average person is very unathletic and generally uncoordinated. As long as you can move reasonably well and aren't fat it's unlikely you'll be picked last.	27
1	I'm triggered... someone send help.	27
1	The world revolves around them.	27
1	merry christmas you filthy animal	27
1	Well to be perfectly fair, they are already killing themselves and likely won't live much past 30-40.	27
1	I am 5,10 and above her "height limit" but she's way the fuck above my weight limit from what this guy is saying and holy crap I needed that laugh	27
1	I'm also over six foot, and shallow chicks like this make me rage. I wish they came with a stamp on their forehead so I could spot them a mile away. Terrible woman judges a man by height instead of character. I hope she gets stuck in a tar pit like her ancestors.	27
1	Can't exactly have a great fov with fat around your eyes	27
1	This entire sub is about them not getting away with shit cause they have a hole between their legs lol	27
1	5'5 here. Being shorter may suck a bit but fuck that bitch. Id rather be short than tall with knee problems or something or fat and disgusting	27
1	I'm having a hard time understanding how taking a while to respond is being a "creep"	27
1	&gt; Not on a high horse  Only because it won't hold your weight.	27
1	Not exactly a battle of mental heavyweights.	27
1	Her story was true but that's still a fake black eye and her nose isn't broken at all. She exaggerated to attract attention to the incident.	27
1	This is a tripple pass denial. Almost unheard of around these parts.	27
1	Sorry that it took me so long to respond to this. I'm a creep.	27
1	That's pretty easy to do when you have your own gravitational pull.	27
1	their idea of equality is substantive, not formal, their modus operandi is to reverse their idea of the social order by placing themselves in the role of citizens and putting men in the role of second class citizens. Its about leverage, not true equality. Otherwise they wouldn't advocate for quotas but for better anti-discrimination policies.	27
1	Good on him for keeping his cool. From the video description, it looks like the cops sided with him, as they should.	27
1	This isn't PPD, this is a violation of civil rights. They attempted to illegally detain a law student while waiting for drug dogs to show up (which found nothing when they finally did), and when she let them know that she knew her rights and wouldn't stand for it, they assaulted her.  I hope this girl gets a nice award from this.	27
1	Enjoy your flair. You are not going to like it.	27
1	Lmao.   &gt; You are not going to like it.  Like hell, I won't!	27
1	So he's an idiot for running away and not just fucking shooting every single person that charged him? Idiots like you just make it harder for everyone else to legally own one for protection.	27
1	Fuck I failed again. I suck at this mod shit.	27
1	This need a trigger warning for headphone users.	27
1	Half the shit on here isn't exactly PPD but the fact that a women is even getting charged for this type of shit is a general PPD most women normally just get a slap on the wrist for sexual offences or they're not even followed up.	27
1	Yes, this covers cops but not border patrol (federal officers).	27
1	So, just let her go and overlook the family of the man who was murdered? Didn't mention the children of the man who was killed. Was he supporting a parent in a nursing home? Putting money away so his kid(s) could go to college? Getting ready to purpose and begin his own family?  But yeah, let the unstable woman, who denied this man his right to live, go for the sake of her kid.	27
1	That's not true. He gave her an option. He said she can leave the area  or get in her car. She decided she didn't want to do either of the two options. They probably didn't want someone randomly walking around their area of operation which is pretty standard in any org.	27
1	14 whiskeys? What is this woman made of?	27
1	Still not inclined to believe her. If she's willing to make herself up and do the Drama Queen thing, she's willing to make up the whole thing.   And OF COURSE the police would believe her. That's SOP for the police. Even if they made the effort to debunk her claims (right), they rarely do anything on the false accusation.	27
1	why does the URL end with "fuck-reddit=deep" ?	27
1	OP I'm all for a good PPD video but this isn't one of them. Not once did she say or do anything unreasonable. She is being detained unduly and they are holding her for "nervousness?". They could barely get those worda out with a straight face. Could have been a female, a male, or a donkey in that video if you take the voice away and just saw the transcript of what happened and the video on mute. That dude assaulted her and detained her when he had no right to. Fuck border patrol and fuck that guy in particular.	27
1	This is the first time I've ever gotten custom flair so thanks! :D	27
1	Completely appropriate reaction, I'm impressed with how he was able to keep cool. As a CHL carrier just watching this and hearing the sounds made me anxious. It's like I can feel the tension in his voice as he really doesn't want to have to shoot people that night. I don't know if I would have stopped to assist that situation, but if 2-4 people rushed me like that I think I would have done the same.	27
1	Guess it's time you hit the research and good ole google. They are allowed to search your car at the boarder, without probable cause.  http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/when-can-officials-stop-question-search-travelers-the-us-border.html	27
1	This is NOT a PPD. ITT= people who have no idea how border control works, or what your fucking rights as an american are.  Note- this is NOT at a border.   edit- also should note that she was NOT tased because they were in fear of *anything*, she was tased because they were annoyed and wanted to **force her compliance**. That. Is. Bullshit.	27
1	She just keeps digging herself deeper and deeper and deeper....	27
1	Dog, shut up. She was clearly severely denied in front of an audience and on national tv. And these have legal repercussions? Pirro makes a decision (as the arbitrator) that the disputing parties have agreed to be bound by. A 3rd party will review the decision made by the Judge and imposes a decision that is enforceable in the court of law.	27
1	This may be a repost but I'll always watch it straight thru.  Dumb bitch tries to throw a rape charge and slowly backs down as Pirro trashes her bullshit story.  Guy looks like a bit of a douche but side bitch learned she's a side bitch and that her bullshit won't fly.   10/10 post that shows what this sub is truly about.	27
1	Maybe someone else can give a legal explanation since IANAL, but why would he be responsible for the cell phone bill? I understand that he was using it for several months without paying, but if the phone contract is her in name then shouldn't she still legally be responsible for the cost? And why didn't she try to stop service for the phone?	27
1	So what? Reddit has an upvote system, if you have seen it then just don't watch it.   This planet has timezones, so not everyone will see everything.  I understand you are some 14 year old kid with no life sitting 27/7 on reddit, but other people have lives and jobs.	27
1	I agree with you but she may have thought that settling the phone bill would get the woman to leave him alone and since it comes out of production costs anyway it makes no big difference to the guy. Depending on the setup of the show either the costs will come out of his appearance fee or possibly just be paid by the production company completely without him losing out at all.	27
1	americans turning the justice system into a gameshow...	27
1	Isn't this a clear PP? She makes a false rape claim and only gets verbally admonished. He did a bad job stating his case, he should have gotten damages for false rape allegations. Was hoping the judge would at least call it even.	27
1	I fapped to this last night. It was very mediocre	27
1	How the fuck is this a pussy pass denied?	27
1	Don't stick your dick in crazy.	27
1	But the crazy has a nice rack :(	27
1	How is she wrong? I'm in full agreement jihadists must be exterminated, anyone who disagrees is a sympathizer and should be in regarded as in full agreement with Islamification.   What else can we do? Keep welcoming them into Europe with open arms and free houses? Keep letting them convert our losers and whores into jihadists?	27
1	Fox viewer? Why? Are you one of those idiots who thinks Islamic terror doesn't exist? All those Nigerian and Yazidi girls are just on vacation? When was the last time a Chinese immigrant went on a shooting spree to get us all to worship Confucius?	27
1	Guy is a great example of a gun carrier, people need to understand that you're not "giving up your rights to the big bad government" by complying with a cop that just wants to know why you have a gun in public	27
1	i honestly don't know what to say...	27
1	YOU DON'T FUCKING SCARE ME	27
1	Lol "I aint the one" has to be one of my favorite lines!	27
1	but you sure as hell scare me! lol  seriously though, I don't get what is happening, everyone seems to be sitting and chillin and some cray woman is going cray off in the corner non stop. Cray, yo.	27
1	You don't know what that word means, do you?	27
1	It's a normal occurrence on the NYC subway. As New Yorkers we just ignore the craziness until it directly affects us.	27
1	She gets plenty of men's DNA on her face on a regular basis.	27
1	She was not scared.	27
1	That moment when entitlement gets wiped from your face	27
1	I described what happened, when it happened.  &gt;"And I called you a white knight because you clearly have a hero complex when it comes to women.  &gt;TWAT!!!"  And I think you're an imbecile, but let's let the community vote who's right and who's the raging imbecile.	27
1	"That's a flat screen!"	27
1	I think people in this sub take anything negative to a woman as a pussypassdenied. There was no pass presented here to be denied. From reading the article I'm even questioning whether a life sentence was justified.	27
1	Also 11:05 Pirro just gets down to business.   I kind of feel bad for the girl, not only is she dumb enough to accuse him of forced intercourse (on the first day of a 4-5 month relationship no less) but she does not articulate herself well and thinks a court room is an appropriate place to attack the guy.   I would agree that its slander/libel (online source?) Because he had a very real and substantial consequence from her post.	27
1	I'm sure her fellow inmates will make her run...	27
1	That *STFU* slap, I would have done it 9 mins earlier...	27
1	This is the post that is pushing me to unsubscribe. This is about the.... 20th post in a row I've caught somewhere in my front pages that have nothing to do with a pussy pass.   Mods, just rename the sub "womengetpunished" and be done with it.  Later, shitsub.	27
1	That cheering at the end made me feel like I was there celebrating with them.	27
1	About time! This is gonna be interesting!	27
1	He doesn't scare her, her man, OR her dog!	27
1	LOL *"Take off your clothes at least"* ---- random black guy says *"Nahhh, we don't want dat smell.  She a flat screen"*  I love living here.  That was a D train, heading north.	27
1	You slap a bitch before she annoys the piss out everyone else and they'll kick yo ass off too	27
1	to be fair, that moment never happened in this video. Even after she got laid out and was thrown from the train, she's still screaming and banging on shit. Let us hope this video being on the internet forever will be some good embarrassment for her at least.	27
1	That's cuz she thinks she's untouchable as a woman.	27
1	Your homeless hahahaha. What a dried up soul	27
1	If only you took your own advice you could have avoided all those downvotes.	27
1	She can save face all she wants but having people cheer when you get thrown off the train after getting slapped in the face speaks volumes and I'll guarantee she heard something.	27
1	For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun	27
1	Yes, Britta, we get it. You lived in New York. Enough already.	27
1	I'll handle his reply for him    "S0 FUCKING WHAT??  LIKE I CARE ABOUT IMAGINARY KARMA! lol"    I think that'll come fairly close.	27
1	I want to hear from someone she knows. Does she feel ashamed? Does she regret acting like a god damn animal? She got what was coming to her that's for sure.. I just would like to know if she understands that.	27
1	Not quite PPD yet but PPD in the making. Like the Ellan Poe story I think we should let this one ride. It is almost a battle of PPDs. The fuckwit writer or the fuckwit Dean.  Who will win. No idea.... maybe we get a double PPD for shits and giggles :)	27
1	"Bitch we all know your pussy staank" haha HERE IT GOES	27
1	Why would you be if no one is allowed to hit you back?	27
1	Their "cause" has far exhausted its relevance; there is not a "proper" way to go about it anymore baring some very specific instances.	27
1	1 minute in "I'm not watching 10 minutes of this" 2 minutes in http://imgur.com/kLPzmio	27
1	I see JLo isnt taking the cancelation of american idol pretty well	27
1	lol you cared enough to [PM me about it.](http://i.gyazo.com/90aa75661be5218337361c526d498842.png)	27
1	lol, reddit, where disagreeing with your comment makes you a piece of shit.	27
1	I was expecting right at the end to see the doors about to close and she jams herself into the opening with both arms forcing the doors open and holding up the train.  That would have been the icing on the cake to see someone give her the 300 front kick out the door and send her squeaking down the concrete away from the train as it pulls away.	27
1	Not a single white knight was spotted! Very good to see!	27
1	An FSU alum in Florida! What are the odds! Conspiracy	27
1	I felt like taking off my shirt and pounding my chest.	27
1	With genders reversed it would have taken 30 seconds max.	27
1	Keep your shorts on, rookie.	27
1	Excellent behaviour on the whole from videographer and officers.  I'm always happy to see calm cops respecting rights.  That part where they didn't flip the fuck out about the camera and assured him that he only needed to stop filming so they could view the evidence was very professional.	27
1	I loved that a couple of the mild mannered old white guys in the back gave her the finger as the train left the stop.	27
1	Top comment on youtube:  &gt;Women like this give ladies a bad wrap everywhere. Not all of us act like her.  EVERY time there is a video of a woman acting badly there is a swarm of women posting something like this. LOL.	27
1	I absolutely love that the closest thing to a white knight in that entire video was just the one guy telling the dude with the sign "you're better than that". Not even a white knight thing to say, just love that it was the closest thing... Then the cheering... Sweet music to my ears :)	27
1	You do realize that you've turned into the girl in the video, right?	27
1	&gt;I felt like taking off my short...        Apparently, he doesn't have shorts. Just one short.	27
1	But that's a good thing! Women begin to speak out against other women and dissociate themselfes from this screamig bitches. Maybe, just maybe, one glorious day they will side with those who denie the pp and call them out for their shit.	27
1	But.. But.. What about patriarchy?!	27
1	Isn't the author, Sabrina Erdely, still a writer for Rolling Stone? Her head and career should be rolling. To me that's a pussypass.	27
1	I knew this would find its way here after I saw it on front page...   I dont think you need the disclaimer in the title. He was laughed at for being a male in the situation and the host denied the audiences collective pussy pass to laugh and get away with it. The exact reasoning the host gives is what this sub is.	27
1	The videos fine. Pussy pass denied is ultimately about women not being treated like special snowflakes or given special circumstances because they're women. Anything happening to women is basically qualifying for this subreddit. Frankly I think the screaming and trying to justify assaulting an officer because "You pushed me" and "are you fucking retarded" definitely came from something other than her civil liberties.  Anybody telling you otherwise is butthurt over the video.	27
1	I feel like most redditors don't like this sub for some reason. I commented "/r/pussypassdenied? on the original post and got super downvoted.	27
1	They think this is a hate group. Which, to be fair, it turns into from time to time.	27
1	The funny thing is he us a huge anti-police and government activist, so it's kinda funny at how nice they were. Probably blew his mind.	27
1	Always makes me sick when people laugh at something like this.	27
1	Can we honestly say that? Some of the vids push the line with both being arseholes to each other or that being rude is enough for a slap down.  Then there is the comments section.	27
1	That 180° on turning laughing into clapping...	27
1	Nepotism is huge in journalism. Like, unreasonably huge.	27
1	As a woman, no fuck that, as a person this pisses me the hell off. The things that women get away with just because they have a vagina instead of a penis is disgusting.	27
1	Video was taken down. I found a copy here: http://czech720.com/czech-casting-lucie-5334/	27
1	They probably were ashamed, I hope	27
1	clapping to act like they werent laughing just moments before.  "yeah..yeah i agree jeremy kyle...these...OTHER...audience people laughing...ridiculous"	27
1	It is not PPD and this sub itself has gone to hell. Standing up for your rights is what a good citizen does, holing LEO's responsible for abuse is a must. These LEO's assaulted a woman with a deadly weapon, that is no joke.	27
1	though not PPD, if they told her to wait her ass on the side of the road because they decided they wanted to inspect her car, she should have waited her ass on the side of the road.  Whether or not you like the authority they have, they have it and will be backed up by the people that gave them that authority.  She was being a bitch and non compliant to very calm officers telling her they are waiting for the K9 unit to arrive.  She got irate and her actions led to her being tazed.	27
1	I commented on one that seem deleted, I side with the woman on this one this is not PPD and these guards are at best unprofessional and at worst "utter cunts"   thinking someone "appearing nervous" is legit grounds to impound and detain your car is fucking ridiculous.  this border patrols are bang out of order, I support her conduct and cause, she has every right to defend her rights and kudos to her for not kowtowing to a bully.	27
1	I feel like nowadays there should be public service announcements once an hour that remind people that it is 100% legal for someone to film in an public place. And maybe force cops to have a badge or patch added to their uniforms as well so if they ever try to stop someone from filming the victim can point to the cops own uniform as proof that it is legal.	27
1	The thing is:  she is partially correct.  Rodriguez vs. US indicates that it is illegal for an officer to detain someone until the K9 unit arrives UNLESS there is probable cause.  However,  "nervousness" can be considered probable cause.  She contests that she is nervous, which would make the entire thing illegal.	27
1	Standing up for your rights, and not consenting to random searches based on illegitimate bullshit randomly pulled out of thin air by Boarder Patrol doesn't mean you have something in your car. I frequently assert my rights, and I never drive with anything illegal in my car. That being said, I am also respectful, and obey orders. The side of the road is not the place to fight a cop.	27
1	Her job is not to problem solve or not be antagonizing. As someone having her rights abrogated and her time wasted, I think that irritation is completely justified. She has no expectation of professionalism, and she doesn't draw a salary generally equal to 1.5x the median household income to be professional. I will never have any expectations of compliance and copsucking from free people.	27
1	So George Washington should have left the colonies because he didn't like the King's laws? You're a coward.	27
1	Warning shots are considered illegal in many states in america. For one, because they can harm innocent bystanders, as the velocity of the bullet even when falling from the sky can still penetrate skin and bone.  Fire one into the ground, it could ricochet.  I'm pretty sure a universal "I have a gun, back the fuck off" is more than enough to get any reasonable person to back off. I'm not going to attempt to assault somebody with a gun, and if I did, i'd expect to get shot.	27
1	I doubt it with her attitude	27
1	&gt; fat dumb cop  And now we're done listening to you	27
1	He's not wrong. You exposed your bias. Own up to it.	27
1	Also I have no idea when the incident happened but back in April the US supreme court ruled the cops cannot make someone wait for the K9s (http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/04/us_supreme_court_rules_against.html)	27
1	Almost everywhere in the US, the 2nd amendment is your legal permit to carry a loaded AR on your back.	27
1	Thanks CBS ad executive. I especially like your attempt at viral marketing.	27
1	From the pictures it seems a much bigger woman used a weapon to hit a tiny little unarmed man who was wearing a stupid shirt. And from the description she was being loud and obnoxious while Mayweather's entourage was trying to ignore her.    How could anyone defend this woman?	27
1	the feminists will find a way lol	27
1	If you actually read the article you'll realise it's a clickbait story and that Floyd was not involved at all.  Bf of the woman got kicked out for what seems like harassment/aggression.  Gf approaches kid in Floyds camp angry that her bf got kicked out. She allegedly says "you wanna hit me".  Security try escort her out too, she turns around and hits dude with a "thunderstick" (whatever the fuck that is).  Then he hits the bitch back.  Then everyone on the internet with "a voice" blames mayweather, completely ignoring the evidence and the original perpetrator.  Fuck people.	27
1	Because you should never for any reason in your entire life ever put your hands on a woman for any reason, ever. **/s**	27
1	"He obviously loves fighting! She was trying to be nice!"	27
1	You probably could kill a fly or make a humans eye water with a well aimed strike	27
1	The tweet that describes it says that she punched him WHILE holding a thunderstick.  I dunno, maybe the guy isn't a languager, or maybe she didn't hit him with inflated plastic and he felt the need to respond.  The hell do I know though, I wasn't there.	27
1	So as long as the attack doesn't exceed a certain amount of force, then the victim cannot fight back?	27
1	She's going to make a great wife someday.	27
1	I think he let the spit in the face slide. It was the ass kick that pushed him over the edge	27
1	I think he meant to reference the, "don't do more than you have to" rule here. It doesn't really apply, it's not like he knocked her down and stomped her or hit her multiple times.	27
1	after reading the comments of other people that witnessed it, she punched him in the face while holding the thunder stick in her hand. she never *actually* hit him with the stick.	27
1	So? She shouldn't be a fucking cunt and think she can touch someone without permission.	27
1	And I'd argue she's a cunt for thinking it's okay to hit some one else without any reason to. Toy or otherwise.	27
1	There's a funny Workaholics scene where they debate whether not hitting a woman because she's a woman is sexist	27
1	single mom* :')	27
1	Damn.... he let a lot slide.	27
1	Theres an eye witness saying she punched him. Name calling is unwarranted.	27
1	http://i.imgur.com/98DzrAg.jpg Says she punched him. I wasn't there, people say it was with a tube, others say she punched him. Im going to go with, if you hit some one, you deserve to get hit back. Hands to yourself children.	27
1	[It seems men prefer to date black women the least](http://blog.okcupid.com/).	27
1	&gt; Floyd was not involved at all.  The title says nothing of Mayweather himself being involved, where did you get that from?	27
1	Either way, she will think twice about acting tough trying to get away with striking someone.	27
1	He showed you the facts.  How is that stupid?	27
1	STATISTICS ARE NOW GENERALIZATIONS. TIL.  YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST!	27
1	If she just gets escorted out she's probably not going to learn a lesson from it. She'll just talk about how she was treated unfairly etc etc... I bet after she got hit she'll think twice about assaulting someone again.	27
1	Nah, its cool bro. numbers are racist.	27
1	I'm not arguing with anyone. Go debate some where else.	27
1	Google thunderstick, I wouldn't really call it a *weapon*. Although, your point still stands and I agree.  Edit: this is a [thunderstick](http://www.promorevolution.com//cats/21780/images/products/1390363m.jpg)	27
1	FINALLY, some of that white privilege I've been holding out for!	27
1	There is no correlation, they straight up asked people what they prefer. This is a straight statistic	27
1	I was just glad he kept the people in frame most of the time.	27
1	Was she arrested?  I kind of feel like the police would get there and arrest the guy.  He'd get thrown in jail, lose his job, and she'd get off scot free.  Which would be a pussypass.  It's great she got a beating but if there were no other repercussions she got off easy.	27
1	Blacks versus Africans is always fun.	27
1	Exactly. Black Americans are petty, violent wimps compared to black Aftican immigrants.	27
1	The data showed the preferences of over 25 million people. That is not a negligible amount.	27
1	I agree that you can't extrapolate this to the entire country or world, but it is data that clearly points to millions of men favoring any other race besides black women. The truth is somewhere in the middle but ignoring this because it's "only 25 million ok cupid users" is a bit hasty.	27
1	It's stupid because those facts are very inconvenient for his argument, duh!	27
1	"Why can't I find a good man?"	27
1	I love the classical quote every woman makes "You can't beat me", ten seconds later after one push / punch, they walk away crying screaming for help.	27
1	"I'm coloring bitch, back off."	27
1	Is it a he or a she? I think it might be a female	27
1	I'm pretty sure it's a female sitting at the desk.	27
1	this has nothing to do with gender. just a disrespectful self centered twat getting what's dues.	27
1	How can you see that???	27
1	Here we see a privileged white male oppressing 5 black females.	27
1	My boobmeter, it is powerful. Pause at 12 seconds. Edit for video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aeH4vB37l0&amp;feature=youtu.be	27
1	He was doing the right thing by shielding his eyes. Direct eye contact can be taken as a sign of aggression by the troop.	27
1	http://imgur.com/A5Qp2oH oh yeah. I took a screenshot Edit: for real though, I took a screenshot and I detect boobs http://imgur.com/u6e8pmK	27
1	just found this version, would have posted it instead if i found it first https://vine.co/v/eK9LFmmqY1W	27
1	The one in the hoody is a girl.	27
1	did everything he/she(?) could to ignore it.  women either need to learn how to not invade peoples' personal space or how to fall better.  one of the two ladies, time to make a decision	27
1	Did anyone else notice she stepped on her (yes, it's a girl) wrist/hand?	27
1	I'd like to see the aftermath. I'd be willing to bet the whole tribe attack her after that.	27
1	You broke the rule.  Everyone breaks the damn rule.   &gt;To be more clear: ONLY POST IF A WOMAN ATTEMPTS TO USE HER GENDER TO GAIN ADVANTAGE/AVOID REPERCUSSION, AND IS DENIED THAT ADVANTAGE.      I see no use of gender to gain advantage or avoid repercussion, therefore, *le downvote*.	27
1	Eh...she's legal in my state.	27
1	Oh boy, riots will start, a white male assaulted a black woman. Board up the 7/11's guys, shits about to go down, this is OPPRESSION.	27
1	Do... Do you know what subreddit we're in?	27
1	That's a privileged white girl in the hoodie.	27
1	Girlz 'n da Hood.	27
1	Kind of matters for such a specific sub like /r/pussypassdenied. There's not much gray area here.	27
1	this is the kind of thing that makes people racist	27
1	She might have stepped on the persons hand.	27
1	grey hoodie is a girl too.	27
1	Huh? His names poopooslut.	27
1	So...does anyone have any idea what the hell is going on in this classroom?	27
1	I'd like to see the monsteraftermath.	27
1	I'm white and my girlfriend is black but im pretty sure both of us would agree with you	27
1	Majority black school...  enough said...	27
1	It totally fucking matters. Get this shit out of here.	27
1	I don't know what the hell is going on in that classroom, but that dancing on the desks and whatever the hell else, isn't acceptable behavior in schools.	27
1	Not really. This sub is intended for videos where someone attempts to use their gender to their advantage and fails. If she had stepped on the desk because she thought no one would push a girl then I would say it belonged here but as far as I can see that's not the case; she's just completely inconsiderate.	27
1	Because "yes, she's a girl" sounds redundant. At least to me. Just the same as when you say "It's a boy!" when you find out the sex of a newborn.	27
1	Just let me do my work you cunt!	27
1	You said:   &gt;"Does no one else soo(see?) this as wrong?"  So you don't really know whether it's correct or not. You can't claim it as such. "It" works. It doesn't remove sapience or anything.	27
1	umm because they are. why would i try to hide facts?	27
1	oh yeah i'm so ignorant. show me one video where white girls are dancing on a table while a black person tries to study	27
1	Of course...this was *clearly* a racially motivated hate crime against the underprivileged black girls by a white oppressor.	27
1	Maybe you like to get stepped on but most of us won't get off to it.	27
1	Where is the teacher?	27
1	I do see such a use. She expects to be able to jump on the student's desk without repercussion.	27
1	She was dancing on a desk at a school while someone was trying to learn. She's lucky someone hadn't knocked her down earlier. It's this kind of shit that causes systematic poverty. Schools in poor districts suck because the students have shitty attitudes.	27
1	Being anti-sjw is not the same as being pro-racist	27
1	Daaayyyyuuuummm. Blondie was going at her.	27
1	#It's a girl.	27
1	did you notice she gave everyone the finger?	27
1	That site sucks though.   I found a better link.   [She queefs super loud at about 19:50](http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=121834004)	27
1	Who would fuck that fat ugly thing...... gross.	27
1	Holy shit. What is it the feminists are fond of saying? If you've had so much as a sip of beer you're too drunk to give consent, and it's rape? Well, i don't think there's a more pronounced male-version of this than how drunk these guys must have been to have sex with that thing, and she clearly raped them. There's no way they were sober enough to give consent to that thing. Ugliest creature i've ever seen in my life.	27
1	That is great. She got what she deserved. On a side note two guys actually banged this thing?	27
1	The true question is who would rape that fat ugly thing?	27
1	It didn't go so well for this welsh footballer.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11169327/Footballer-Ched-Evans-comes-out-of-prison-vowing-to-overturn-rape-conviction.html  I've found that even some of the most conservative older women find it hard to believe the girl.	27
1	rape that? lel...	27
1	"In mitigation, Tony Ventham said Richess - who is seven-and-a-half months pregnant by her current partner - said she felt pressured in to reporting the false claims because her former boyfriend was ‘violent’ and ‘controlling’."  Oh of course it's someone else's fault that she almost wrecked two men's lives. Fuck this fat bitch.   AND she did cocaine while 7 months pregnant -- WHAT THE FUCK.	27
1	They will also tell you false accusations happen so rarely that they shouldn't be mentioned.  [Meanwhile:](https://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/dnaevid.txt)  &gt; "Every year since 1989, in about 25 percent of the sexual assault cases referred to the FBI where results could be obtained (primarily by State and local law enforcement), the primary suspect has been excluded by forensic DNA testing."	27
1	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)	27
1	Get a fucking adblocker, retard.	27
1	This is good and all but two and a half years versus the decades that each of them would have done if they had been found guilty?  If you file a false rape charge, the sentencing should match what your rapist would have been given.  Not to mention that some people will always wonder just a little bit about the two of them from now on.  Even if the chargers are dropped, being accused of rape fucks a person's reputation.	27
1	like most feminist ideologies it only applies to women. woman has some drinks = unable to consent. man has some drinks = still has personal responsibility.	27
1	open the link and saw the picture. the first thought i had: "..bro....."	27

1	I'm all for the "feminists exaggerate the living shit out of statistics and we should prove them wrong" attitude. But this comment seems a little iffy on its own. Do you have any sources on that?	27
1	I too would like a source	27
1	Fighting is apart of animal/human nature. You have a problem with someone squash it or fight. If you have to fight dont be a bitch about it. Fight, get it over with, and leave. Pretty simple. No need to jump or bitch after you lost	27
1	&gt; She has now been jailed for two-and-a-half years by a judge who told Richess her lies had an ‘insidious and corrosive’ effect on public confidence and the justice system.    Am i the only one that screamed "booyah!" out loud after reading that?	27
1	They dodged the rape charges, but when is their trial for Bestiality?	27
1	Just look at his post history.  And I quote:  &gt;All niggers tits look weird...	27
1	Plus she had a boyfriend?	27
1	Well...they do.	27
1	... it has one of the most successful conviction rates of any crime, including murder; unless you factor in false accusations that later got overturned. The fuck are you propaganding about?	27
1	Talk to a feminist. They actually believe this. It wasn't manufactured from thin air to generate hate, it generates hate because it was manufactured from thin air.  Despite what morons believe, only a non-feminist is capable of independent and rational thought.	27
1	I exaggerated, but otherwise it's true. A drunk girl can't give consent, but a drunk man can. What constitutes drunk is a matter of opinion, apparently; but this is a nearly universal opinion.  Have a conversation with a ~~fucking idiot~~ feminist sometime. You'll see what i mean. I've never talked to a ~~fucking moron~~ feminist and walked away feeling like the world wasn't a worse place for their existence.	27
1	Yeah you are right. I forgot about that and come to think of it didn't the article mention she was pregnant from a different guy? Man these guys are either blind or amazingly desperate.	27
1	Alcohol can make both of those happen.	27
1	They needed someone to make it a not gay 3 way	27
1	Haha shit they could aimed a little higher right?	27
1	"She has now been jailed for two-and-a-half years by a judge who told Richess her lies had an ‘insidious and corrosive’ effect on public confidence and the justice system."  I bet the fat lying cunt cried when the judge told her that. Why cry when you know you are full of shit anyway?  This is what happens when a dumb bitch thinks it's better to protect her nonexistent reputation by destroying other people's lives.   Should have given her 10 years, though if this were the U.S., I bet she would have gone free, mattress in hand.	27
1	With all the publicity that may very well be her last boyfriend, she will need to change her name and lose all that weight if she want's another when she gets out of the slammer, but she's too fat to put forth the effort anyway.	27
1	Dropped, time served.	27
1	&gt;Let's not pretend that someone shows up, cries rape, and the accused automatically gets thrown in jail.  Is that not what literally happened in this article?	27
1	But, if they aimed it higher wouldn't they have gotten it in each other's hair?	27
1	You don't actually believe that, do you?	27
1	Arrested (being thrown in jail) ≠ convicted (a judge and jury find you guilty)  &gt; Her ‘deceitful web of lies’ resulted in the arrest of the two soldiers	27
1	Seriously... whats gonna happen when her kid can google her moms name? They'll discover that she did cocaine while 7 and a half months pregnant and had a 3 way, while she was in a relationship. What a worthless whore, I feel bad for that kid.	27
1	So hold on. Do you honestly think if a woman is drunk, she can't give consent, but if a man is drunk, he can? How the fuck is that not a double standard?	27
1	&gt;But on a serious note, yes, it is his fault "some cunt" tried to ruin his life. If he hadn't gotten drunk and fucked her, he wouldn't have been in this position.  Haha wow, you're a dumbass.  "Why'd you go outside? You wouldn't of been raped if you just stayed inside!" - your argument weighs as much as that one.   &gt;don't drink and fuck.  Thats some of the dumbest, most antisocial advice i've ever heard.	27
1	She's pregnant now. The alleged rape and cocaine happened two years ago I think the article said.	27
1	they also say crazy shit like " Evidence is a social construct of the patriarchy"	27
1	The report mentions that this incident happened  over two years ago. She is currently 7 1/2 months pregnant while being sentenced.   I do get a chuckle how she mentions that she had done cocaine for the "first time" that night.	27
1	That's still 20 years between the two of them good god. Damn you're a piece of shit. You just wreak of someone who constantly corrects people and has to be right. People *love* that, by the way.	27
1	And they say women have a hard time in this world. This sow is capable of having sex with three men in a week and one of them was a steady partner. An ugly, stupid, fat, and charmless man would have to hire a hooker to get that kind of action in such a sort space of time.	27
1	Being pregnant doesn't make your face and entire body swell up with excess fat. You can maintain an actual body builders physique while pregnant but far too many people just use it as an excuse to fall into their vices and lounge around all day. You can easily visit any African village and look for pregnant women, they'll most likely be working around the village doing their daily tasks and looking thin sans the enlarged stomach.	27
1	Even if BOTH parties drank and had consenting sex (backed up with text messages ) they still say the woman was raped. Cant remember the case but recently it happened to a guy in college and he was kicked out and she tried to sue or something.    Regret does not = rape	27
1	I have met many feminist in my life. Only one was ever the "extreme" type that told me that my existence itself, as a white male, was oppressive to minorities and women. Most feminists just want equal treatment for men and women; but they are the silent majority. The "radical" type of feminist make up a minority of the group. The problem is that they scream the loudest.	27
1	A life time of regret...	27
1	&gt; Do you have any sources on that?  English muthafucka; can you read it?	27
1	That guy was an ASSHOLE.	27
1	65 months is the average rape sentence not 9. pussy pass maintained imo.  Edit: if its only attempted rape because he didn't nut she got a massive pussy pass.	27
1	It was reduced, I agree with you, but I still think the fact that she has to register as a sex offender is pretty good...  Justice system in Seattle for ya... ಠ_ಠ	27
1	&gt;She was originally charged with rape, but it was reduced to attempted rape and assault...      But she was having INTERCOURSE with him while he SLEPT. PP Still intact.	27
1	"The victim *eventually* pushed her off"  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)	27
1	You wish to be raped by a drug addicted rando? So you can be potentially exposed to various STDs? Wow. You sure aim high.	27
1	Charged with attempted rape? Wtf? Thats an outrage. Reverse the genders and see how the public would react to a man who snuck in and did that and only got 9 months for *attempting it*	27
1	Definitely a pass, if it was a man the sentence would be much longer i thinks	27
1	Nobody will take it seriously when she tells them she's a sex offender, though.	27
1	"Im not sure if I like..this...  ... ... ok get off"	27
1	She'll show up on the online maps and be driven from home after home by paranoid helicopter parents regardless.	27
1	Did he get any STDs from her? that's fucked up..	27
1	Don't judge him. He's probably very, very lonely.	27
1	Well the article did say he recognized this woman and a local drug abuser aka crack head.  Who know what diseases she had.	27
1	what do you know? you're not even an ambulance.	27
1	No you don't. If you *want* to be raped then it's consensual. What you want is obviously just sex. This is the retarded response everybody gives when hearing about females raping males.  Grow a brain.	27
1	Not always true. Maybe in conversation, but you'd better believe anyone doing a background check is going to take it seriously (like potential employers).	27
1	This is just lazy prosecution imo. Sounds like a deal. Guilty plea for less serious charges. It's likely that the prosecution didn't think this case was worth too much time. Which kind of annoys me because it's clearly a damn rape and this shit wouldn't fly with genders reversed. Pussy pass maintained.   The bit about registering as a sex offender is good though.	27
1	&gt; Edit: if its only attempted rape because he didn't nut she got a massive pussy pass.  I think that's how it works for men, right?  If she doesn't cum it's only attempted rape, right?	27
1	Half of male redditors want to get raped?  Edit: I also added male.	27
1	nah they'll probably call her in for an interview and ask her about the charge. *Then* they won't hire her when she tells them she legitimately raped a guy in his sleep.	27
1	They forgot to add "male."	27
1	Breaking in and raping him. not attempted rape, but forcefully having sex with him. for what reason did they change the charge? she's also described as "a drug user in the area." possibility that she's had encounters with the law before.  i understand that she pleaded guilty, but only 9 months.. wtf. i googled the average and it's roughly 6 years.	27
1	If this isn't a good enough reason for police to wear body cameras, I don't know what is.	27
1	&gt; 240lb Chantae Gilman  doubt it	27

1	She advocated killing people because of their colour and gender.  That makes her a racist sexist scumbag.	27
1	Then let her be a martyr.  Let her be another Wu or Sarkeesian living off of internet panhandling.  So long as the message is sent that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated by polite society and that there will be consequences for abusing one's position in this manner I don't care about her "martyrdom."	27
1	It's been posted, but I never get tired of watching it.	27
1	What is most terrifying is that my girlfriends daughter just told me she agrees with this persons point of view. I had no words, I had to just walk away. My mind can't fathom that people actually think like this, let alone one of them lives in the same house as me and I'm paying their college tuition.   What the fuck?	27
1	"Omg get him ooooff"  Seconds after "lol stfu"	27
1	Have you thought about posting this in /r/TumblrInaction OP?	27
1	I did and since deleted the post. It didn't get much of a response, and the some of the subscribers of the sub said that stripping her of her degree was going to far.	27
1	Just to contribute here, this is [the same woman](http://imgur.com/SrtUjzt)	27
1	He probably meant why are you paying it, not what is it.. She's not your wife and she's not your daughter. What in the fuck do you owe these people.	27
1	I love how these new age progressive lunatics just redefine racism so that it fits their racist agenda.	27
1	Screw it, everyone should wear a bodycam and record everything. Can you imagine how much time could be saved in court cases, disputes, bro-arguments, etc.?	27
1	What is wrong with her?! Signed. If the gender roles were reversed, that man would be ostracized and kicked from his job so hard.	27
1	Stop paying.  Now.	27
1	Ethnic minority?  She's whiter than I am.	27
1	bitch hit like a girl so its a fair fight.	27
1	Signed and wrote my two cents in the "I'm signing because..." box, if it's worth anything.	27
1	Holy shit you're a fucking loser dude.	27
1	Signed.... I really hope to come back to r/pussypassdenied in the near future and see her in shambles. We can still redeem "We did it Reddit!"	27
1	Her look of disbelieve is priceless...	27
1	Since she is not of the dominant and favourable gender, isn't it scumbaggerina then?	27
1	remember racism is ok if its against white people	27
1	What are you doing on this sub? You're actually handing out pussy passes like candy.	27
1	Need to see a bit more leading up to that to call it PPD.  Vid starts with him screaming and walking toward her aggressively.  She doesn't shove or hit or spit... just puts her hand up to keep him out of her personal space and says "get the fuck away from me" which seems justified.	27
1	scumbaggery     scumvaginy     scumvagin     scumvajin     scumvaj     cumvaj     cunvaj     cunt	27
1	/pol/ was right again. Anti-racism is a code word for anti-white.	27
1	Wow, I just, I can't. Wow.	27
1	A bot like you would save so much bandwidth.  Thank you.	27
1	&gt;I, an ethnic minority woman, cannot be racist or sexist towards white men because racism and sexism describe structures of privilege based on race and gender and therefore women of colour and minority genders cannot be racist or sexist, since we do not stand to benefit from such a system.  Translation:  I'm a member of a cult that chooses to define the words "racism" and "sexism" differently than the commonly accepted definition of those words.  According to the actual definition of those words, I'm actually a massive racist and sexist scumbag.	27
1	Jesus Christ...when these fucking lunatics come out in the open it really makes the whole SJW/SRS thing tangible.  These people are out there.  They're real, they have real power, and they're fucking insane.	27
1	I think we're going to see it more and more.  First world feminism is pure, unspooled insanity and it's going to spread because of all the attention this is getting.  It's a race to the bottom in the oppression olympics.	27
1	The fact that she's universally vilified, will probably lose her job, and absolutely no one will hire her when she graduates is punishment enough.	27
1	Aliyah totally let her down	27
1	"No, she needs to learns &amp; he gonna learns her."	27
1	What if that tuition magically 'dissapears'?	27
1	No matter your level of privilege, discrimination of either gender or race, sexuality or faith is intolerable.	27
1	Let's go with cumvaj	27
1	2 weeks later they dating	27
1	Of course ! Damn, 12 000 signed already. Nice!	27
1	How can one single person be such a huge retard? STOP PAYING NOW YOU IDIOT	27
1	That awkward moment when you have become the thing you're fighting.	27
1	Silly, we can't have a man as a diversity officer.	27
1	The petition only shows that the public is outraged, the Uni's management will have the final say on what should happen. I really don't think they will take her degree away	27
1	Nah because it has to be hate + power and she has no power. Just look at her! Directing departments of universities and arranging events, excluding particular people from those events... poor girl had no power! Thus, no racism.  Fact of the matter is she could go on a white dude murder rampage and afterward she'd say it was impossible for it to be a gate come because she's a woman and women can't hate crime men because oppression and definitions of hate.	27
1	It's just impossible to be racist against white people. White people have all the power so you can't be racist against them. Right?	27
1	&gt; I'm paying their college tuition.  You mean *were* paying their tuition...right? If she "don't need no man" she certainly "don't need no stipend" from one...	27
1	I always thought people weren't serious when they said shit like this.  Then I met people in real life who thought this. I was amazed and so very disappointed with the world.	27
1	lmao edgy as fuck. You don't completely destroy relationships because *somebody says they agree with someone's opinion*, let alone when it's somebody who was previously doing a very good job of marketing herself as a progressionist and not the extremist she actually is.  I'd be willing to bet you're the kind of person who would stop talking to somebody because you found out they're religious. You're completely retarded.	27
1	Don't forget about sexism...only men can be sexist ya' know.	27
1	mangina or cunt?  Which is it?	27
1	Learn Your Place Achievement Unlocked	27
1	Yeh.  That totally happened.  Wait, I have a better one!  What if he said the asteroid that hit Earth and wiped out the dinosaurs was from the asteroid belt and she no, it was a stray comet!  Yeh, that's the ticket.	27
1	What a bitch. She should definitely be charged.	27
1	yoooo...  especially bro-arguments.	27
1	asterisk because she can be paroled after 7 years....still small victories and all	27
1	and yet here you are bitching about it...	27
1	Hey, why did you delete that FB post?	27
1	Thats exactly what I said when I finished reading her last post.	27
1	Attack a guy and get attacked right back.	27
1	The worst thing for me really is the whole "you're a moron" as a defense when someone is called out on their shit.	27
1	I see you've offered nothing to the sub, how about before you complain about others threads you post stuff of your own?  All i see is a guy offering some PPD on some cunts facebook page, regardless if you agree or not.	27
1	The most frustrating Facebook users are the ones who post something to the public, can't defend themselves or handle other opinions, and quickly delete the comments. This has happened to me on a couple of occasions. Even so, it's satisfying to know you've pushed some buttons.	27
1	Those eyebrows are like caterpillars marching across her forehead.	27
1	Also pretty well-suited for /r/thatHappened	27
1	Which is why you screenshot and post that image to your own page.	27
1	OH MY FUCKING GOD THIS!  You can have a intelligent, factual rebuttal then  BAM!  "You're an idiot", "You're a moron"	27
1	Before the SJWs jump in, read [this article in The Daily Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/03/columbia-student-i-didn-t-rape-her.html).	27
1	This is what some people still don't get about Facebook. Its a fucking life long public record of all of your retarded opinions. Call someone out on being 'sad' for digging up an old post when you pepper the internet with hypocritical shit like that. Stupid cunt.	27
1	That look on her face is straight up boner repellant.	27
1	And tag them in it so it shows on their page	27
1	Oh man, someone should have told the guy that it doesn't count if you have to dig something up in the past.  It's good to know if the guy had told her he was looking at the girl, it would have been fine since he owned up to it.  Fucking hypocrite.	27
1	I wish people would stop keeping the names of women like this private. They'd gladly post the name of the "perv at the gym" for all to see. These crazy bitches deserve the same respect.	27
1	Evolution isn't always good for the participants.	27
1	It's the "hands on my hip" embellishment that did it for me.	27
1	I once saw an argument on reddit where one guy was proven wrong, flat out, so he told the other guy he was a loser wasting time...on reddit...in the same argument with the same amount of comments. Some people just can't deal with being wrong.	27
1	You looked up my post from a month ago? Creep	27
1	Additionally, Facebook sends an email with the contents of a reply to your email address. Been glorious whenever someone has tried to back track on a statement and I'm just like "Let's see what Mr Outlook has to say shall we? Oh look it says you're a horrible person." and then bam, she's just taken a screenshot of her words harder than a cock.	27
1	I agree, I am amazed every time. I think it is short circuiting their brain. They may be too indoctrinated or dumb to realize the hypocrisy and see the big picture; so it doesn't register. Or maybe they realize the hypocrisy and they can't accept the truth so they attack back. Women especially cause they hold the future children of the species so people will white knight a woman that is perceived as fertile. So women can attack and almost always have someone to back their attack.	27
1	damn, i read the story cucumberferitywallow links to in the comments and i was really angry that she went to such great lengths to blame&amp;shame an innocent guy. i wonder how she likes a cookie of her own dough.	27
1	Why is it the most vocal and outgoing "protectors of civility" always turn out to be huge gaping hypocrites?  Are they running from themselves?	27
1	How DARE a heterosexual male look at a female in a sexual manner!	27
1	Second actual PPD on here in a week. Yay!	27
1	"Let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that I am persecuted whenever I'm contradicted." - Ralph Waldo Emmerson	27
1	Crossposting a comment of mine from /r/SRSucks:  ----  &gt;It’s ridiculous that he would read it as a `bullying strategy,’ especially given his continued public attempts to smear my reputation, when really it’s just an artistic expression of the personal trauma I’ve experienced at Columbia. If artists are not allowed to make art that reflect on our experiences, then how are we to heal?  --Emma 'fuck me in the butt' Sulkowicz  Source: http://college.usatoday.com/2015/04/24/columbia-student-accused-of-rape-by-mattress-girl-sues-university-for-gender-bias/  Texts here (where the 'fuck me in the butt' quote came from): http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/03/columbia-student-i-didn-t-rape-her.html  ----  Mattress girl should have her 15 minutes of fame revoked.	27
1	I like to do this on a lesser scale. I called out a mod on /r/minecraft for getting testy with me for making a joke then deleting his comments, so I hit the back button a few times, saw his name, and also went into the page cache. He told me I am not allowed to post deleted info. He'd ban me. Swell guy. Terrible liar.  I like doing that. It's like, entertainment, and if it's an argument where they are wrong, it's correcting false information.  It's amazing...	27
1	&gt; *Mods will remove posts that are off-topic, abusive, or contain personal information or links to Facebook pages; doxxing is a bannable offense.*  This is why we don't.	27
1	And it's not a repost!	27
1	For me it was "This fuckin' bitch."	27
1	&gt; "Let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that I am persecuted whenever I'm contradicted." - Ralph Waldo Emmerson  Sooo where was this guy when he said the above? I didn't know he was so quotable -- you know in addition to being so stealthy.  .  Anyway, this quote of his could nearly be posted in response to 50% of all the posts on any of the News/Politics subs here on Reddit and it would be a valid response.	27
1	I knew a girl who used to delete my comments all the time. It's not my fault she didn't tune her guitar before posting videos of her singing	27
1	Don't you know that men are never allowed to look at women, ever, otherwise you're visually raping her or turning her into a sex object! Whereas men must, and should by law, look sexually appealing for women even if they're gay!  Or else you're oppressing women! /s	27
1	Men do not ogle women because we're creeps. We do so because it's *natural* for us to do so. Noticing and observing are necessary first steps to finding a potential mate.  To be fair, most women already know this (of men); why else would they do their utmost to look their best at every turn? *They wish to be noticed*, eh?  This idiot is not going to overturn any biological urges and comes off as stupid and sanctimonious.	27
1	What, she thought she was all that since everyone  told her she was great due to her looks? Just a wild guess...	27
1	What bothers me from all of this is that it is somehow a terrible thing to look at someone you find attractive. I mean if the person spots you and you just dead stare like some sort of freak, that's intimidating but who the fuck cares if you are gawking at someone you find attractive?	27
1	She didn't defend herself at all.  She just called them morons, and creepers, and mocked them.  She knew she was just called out for being a hypocritic bitch, and then started doing all she can do, make herself the victim	27
1	Share it to their wall	27
1	It is. That isn't the girl who posted the status though in case that's unclear.	27
1	No no no because men are in a **position of power** and so cannot be wronged because the patriarchy	27
1	I have this problem with reddit a lot. It's like.. fuck.. i'm just trying to have a conversation, i'm sorry a few people downvoted you to -1.  Probably daily to every other day, i'll go check a comment I made to find out the parent was deleted, and half the time I just have no idea why. GO DOWN WITH YOUR SHIP, COWARDS	27
1	I'm kind of old and I can tell you it didn't use to be this way.	27
1	Furthermore, how DARE you look at the things I've posted publicly in order to respond to the thing I just posted publicly!	27
1	Those subs will flat out ban you the second you think outside the liberal hivemind.  I am willing to bet /r/politics is one of if not the most censored sub on reddit.	27
1	I will always watch this clip all the way through. No matter how many times I come across it.	27
1	Feminism in a nutshell.	27
1	We're living in the age of entitlement and participation ribbons.  Used to be you did something stupid like this someone told you to fuck off and get over yourself.	27
1	That was fucking gooooooooooood. She sounded like a little kid when she refused to explain.	27
1	I was questioning whether this was good enough for /r/pussypassdenied, but I think it will definetly bring some satisfaction to watch and add to the sub. Enjoy this classic.	27
1	It really isn't PPD, but I fucking hate this hen so until I get someone really whiny *I* won't remove it.	27
1	It fucking scares me that there are people like this.  Twisted, abusive and manipulative - and the difference between that and straight up violence is that people will straight up stand around and applaud it when it happens.  We're approaching a new age when SJWs who have never lived under anything like the patriarchy their mother's did - are going to be fucking taking it out on our sons something fierce. And it will be egged on by the white knights.  Fuck it.	27
1	this is like 90% of the reason people delete/restart their social media profiles. most people would never want to be seen next to the them from 10 years ago.	27
1	Yeah, sorry. I was thinking it would somewhat be fitting because she was saying they sent a letter to the church, not that they made it themselves to make anonymous look bad. Still though, hope some enjoy it.	27
1	I'm still laughing. That was fantastic!	27
1	Never argue with a bitch man. Bitches just don't care. They'll say fucking anything. Bill Burr did a good skit on this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNSt3wJXZk0	27
1	Anything that makes the WBC look like the fuckwads they are is fine by me.	27
1	i love that phrase "its just a stupid opinion"	27
1	I like the contrast of that clean cut, well dressed, handsome aussie dude with the fat greasy guy in a sweater.	27
1	I love that at the end, "Good point, as a white man you're not able to have any beliefs". Fuck anyone that tries to say white males can't/are _______, guaranteed they follow it up with a racist/sexist statement. I don't know if it's ignorance or feminism though. Seeing some of the Facebook posts on here make me think it's a c-c-c-combo of both.	27
1	"I'm not gonna fight a girl. etc"  Pussy pass accepted, letting her slide for her shitty confrontational behavior.  *She starts swinging*  Pussy pass REVOKED BITCH.	27
1	he was platonic friend with her, ended to have sex both time before summer break, then had sex again after it. They faded off, she charged him in university system, he been treated as guilty before to be judged.   An ex, and another woman he never met exvept by mail charged him for emotional and physical abuse and attempt of rape.  Medias judged him as guilty, finally he been shown as not guilty.	27
1	I saw this in the YouTube comments and I really can't put it into any better words.  What a cunt.	27
1	She is 100% full of crap. She falsely accused a guy of rape and then walked around campus carrying a mattress to get pity. Deranged people who are willing to manipulate human empathy and destroy a person's life just to feel goo about themselves deserve the worst things in life.	27
1	or "Guys, really, most women aren't like that! We are ashamed of our gender!"	27
1	been following this story for some time. To me me it has been /r/pussypass as she faced no repercussions for her actions.  No fucker will ever higher her. Her negative fame will fade and she will be known as the crazy that begged to be ass fucked AND GOT TURNED DOWN lol.	27
1	No SJWs here mate. We got your back.	27

1	Whats up with her pants lol	27
1	Is the camera hanging from his dick?	27
1	She only hurt her cause by trying to pick a fight with the person giving her a platform to talk. Back to blogging she goes because her tv days are over after this.	27
1	Pathetic, but she needs to be taught a lesson.  If allowed to cry her way out of this, it would only enforce her sense of entitlement.	27
1	I think he's just got a lot of self control and is actually quite intelligent as in the end she got what was coming for her. Not fighting back in a situation like this is the real strength.	27
1	Damn the pussy pass is real because I feel like such a douche white knight right now but I felt bad for her and would have probably let her go. Damn it...	27
1	Repent! Repent your wicked ways and prosecute that bitch!	27
1	"you are not sorry for stealing it you are sorry you got caught"  So fucking true because you know if she was let go she would have though the while thing hilarious.	27
1	Pulls the baby card. There is a reason you haven't been seeing them.	27
1	What a dumb little shit with nothing to offer society. I hope her sentence straightens her out a bit and she becomes at least a little useful.	27
1	Those tears were delicious.	27
1	" I wont inact the labor of explaining" = I don't know what the fuck I am talking about, I am just repeating words that are inside the echo chamber in hopes you will submit before I run out.	27
1	Don't beat yourself up about that. The power of the pussy is strong enough to bring even the hardest man down. Her pussy pass was combined with the repentpass and the childpass.   What the shop owner did was 100% right, but I still kind of feel bad for her.	27

1	Pretty sure the reason he didn't hit her was because of the dude double his size who appears very briefly in the video, not his upbringing.	27
1	Are you gonna get your cousin? Are you gonna get your cousin? Are you gonna get your cousin? Are you gonna get your cousin? Are you gonna get your cousin? Are you gonna get your cousin? Are you gonna get your cousin? Are you gonna get your cousin?	27
1	I like how it went from one month since she saw her son, to two months, to three months when the police arrived. By the time she arrived at the station, she hadn't seen her son since six months before his birth.	27
1	Fuck an eight month sentence. That dude should have set her straight and fucking rocked her, putting her on ass and listened to tears fall while he walked away laughing.	27
1	Exactly. This "I can't hit a woman" macho bullshit need to go. You want to punch someone, man or woman, you should expect to get hit back, man or woman.	27
1	Fucking right my dude!!!!! Equal rights.......and lefts.	27
1	A precedent needs to be set that it is not okay to hit anyone, regardless of gender.	27
1	Not so easy.   Easiest way to get a kicking is to hit a girl, no matter the circumstances.	27
1	Gotta love the logic she uses, apparently HER son is a good reason to steal from other people ?  What if he's the owner or has kids of his own?  She said she has the money to pay, but she's fine stealing from other people ?	27
1	Yep, the primal instincts of white knights will always come the rescue.	27
1	An important lesson was learned that day. You can't go around punching people in the face even if you have a stupid fucking vagina between your legs! Hopefully the system will teach her what her parents refused.	27
1	He probably wanted his cousins to fight her because they're most likely female like her and by the video he isn't okay with hitting girls.	27
1	girl in middle school basically did that shit to me daily.  Slapped me, hit me, and talked shit.  After a couple weeks of her regularly harassing me, she got more bold.  Kicked me in the nads.....without hesitation I hauled off and hit her in the face.  She ended up with a pretty nasty black eye and never picked on me again.  I don't feel bad about it, and I gave her plenty chance to knock that shit off.	27
1	I wish people would just own it.  Put the camera up and shoot the video.	27
1	*where hundreds of viewers left comments praising the boy for not retaliating during the 'humiliating' attack.* ... *One Facebook user said: 'So much respect for that young man, what a star, certainly been brought up the right way.*  Fuck that.  Being brought up the right way means allowing women to beat on you and not defend yourself?  That's some fucked up mentality.	27
1	Lol. This guy is a boss for not screaming at her. Instead he logics her into admittance. Love it!	27
1	Haha, trust me , you haven't dealt with this type of trash before. 13-14year old girls in South London are fucking scary.	27
1	right?  I'm wondering if the bigger dude who came into the frame for a second was backing this girl up or something. That might explain it.	27
1	Using [shopkeeper's privilege] (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopkeeper%27s_privilege). If my memory of U.S. business law is correct, the business just needs to have it posted that they will exercise this right should it become applicable to do so.  Edit: can't seem to get the link to work. Oh well. Just Google it.  Edit 2: finally.	27
1	Im surprised she didnt go the way of sexual favors she tried everything else	27
1	Naw, you know she's cried her way out of stuff her entire life. It was her default reaction to being caught.	27
1	When she was smiling and saying the stuff about soldiers, I was two seconds from punching my screen.	27
1	Except most "feminists" don't want equal rights. They think they know what it means but in reality I would never EVER pay a woman who is 90lbs to do the job of a man who is 180 if it were down to physical ability. Sam as I would never pay a 90lb man the same as a 180 woman  who can do the same job more efficiently.	27
1	The reason he didn't hit her wasn't to give a PP, listen to what she's saying in the video, she knows people that will fuck him up, that's why he didn't retaliate. Although she deserves to get the shit kicked out of her, it wouldn't be worth what would happen to him.	27
1	She's also supposed to be making dinner for him allegedly :I	27
1	Dear hacker  Anonymous thank you for hacking Westboro  website. Please  I beg of you keep up the good work. It is good to see people doing good in the world we need more people like you.	27
1	I dunno, man. It seems like this chick really was deranged. Do a google image search for [Erika Menendez](https://www.google.com/search?q=Erika+Menendez&amp;num=20&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UaleVbexOOjdsATa84PQCw&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=588). Some of those pictures are WTF. Especially [this one from the NYPost](http://nypost.com/2015/05/20/woman-guilty-of-hate-driven-fatal-subway-shove-gets-24-years/). Like she's a beast descending into madness.	27
1	Yeah, but in the article she said that she did it because the man looked Islamic/Hindu. Sounds like a shitty person, mental illness or not.	27
1	I don't think Murdoch actually has anything to do with the Daily Mail, but its editor Paul Dacre is supposedly a cunt of the highest order, so fight him by all means.	27
1	How is this PPD?  I didn't read anything in the stories about her trying to get over because of her gender.	27
1	That's a sign of integrity in my opinion.	27
1	Watched the whole thing.  I didn't realize my dick could get this hard.	27
1	i saw the 420noscope edit first and had to watch the whole thing   after around 30 minute mark he literally third degree speech rapes her the rest of the conversation, i highly reccommend the whole interview   **EDIT**: important triggerwarning for people who cant handle listening to mumbling idiots who have no idea what theyre saying themselves	27
1	[tl;dr version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CgQITcfJd0)	27
1	That guy laughing in the background was way funnier than it should've been.	27
1	Yeah.   I'm glad that at least her son will have a bike to ride. It'd be a nice gift after not seeing him in a month..er two months..I mean three months.. Wait dinner tonight..?	27
1	well the good ol "i was off my meds" was shot down, not much a pussypassdenied however	27
1	at 14:30 she's like "well you don't have the source on you so i don't care" but before she was pulling known false studies as if they were the bible  and at 16:30 she was so thoroughly owned and it was glorious	27
1	&gt; No fucker will ever higher her.   I would imagine a lot of companies with an agenda will hire her and pay her a lot of money. I really feel bad for the guy she accused. He will likely have a hard time finding a job.	27
1	While I personally think the guy was a bit too conservative in his thinking, I couldn't disagree to almost any of his points. He is right on the money!	27
1	hey Mod , the link is down and im really curious what it linked too.. can you be of any help here?	27
1	Go grab your Karma at /r/montageparodies, that was delicious.	27
1	Still have ten mins left in the video and while I have to say yes the majority if not close to all of her points are wrong, she is reacting extremely well to this situation, it's almost unbelievable. Props random feminist lady, you kept your cool better then 99% of people I know would have in this situation.	27
1	close this sub, nothing will top this.	27
1	Isn't that kind of the overall point though? As soon as you start making special concessions for groups of people based on their race or sex, you get stupid shit like this happening? Kids who are far more qualified being turned down for less qualified students simply to meet an arbitrary "diversity quota"	27
1	Go up to a person and tell them that all the beliefs they hold closest to their heart are wrong for an hour and I bet you 90% of people will either have an angry fit, shutdown and stop listening/conversing completely, or just up and walk away. Hell most will probably do all 3 in that order. So yeah props for not freaking out when all of your beliefs are being challenged.  EDIT: Grammar	27
1	\&gt;implying white people don't fight	27
1	She was on the ropes from 5 minutes in and never recovered.	27
1	In an ideal world, yes remaining calm would be the minimum a rational person should do in a debate, but we don't live in an ideal world and as I just said the vast majority of people faced with this situation would not react anywhere near as well as she did. I'm not trying to find things to compliment her on, I'm just expressing my genuine awe at her ability to keep a level head in this situation.  EDIT:Grammar again, *sigh*	27
1	I've been a fan of Gavin Mcinnes since he was [teaching people how to fight babies](https://youtu.be/mTWfqi3-3qU).  Didn't realize how politically/socially active he had become.  Cool stuff.	27
1	Jesus Christ. This is the only thing that has ever made me almost lose my shit at work. I've seen similar things but the joint at the end was so fucking funny, never seen that added in.	27
1	&gt;"there's this massive demand for rapists that's not being met."  Damn.  Also, this is excellent content obviously, but I'm not seeing a PP attempt here. It's misplaced. This belongs in /r/JusticePorn or /r/sjwhate.	27
1	Oh I am so not doing this conversation a third time.	27
1	I agree, I don't really see a pussy pass being denied here.  It could have just as easily been a man he was interviewing giving the exact same points.  She wasn't using her gender to get a pass for any of her opinions.	27
1	&gt; Black women straightening their hair trying to be white?  &gt; "Yeah, basically yes."  I quote a black friend of mine "Bitch, I straighten my hair because I like it fucking straightened, not because I am trying to be fucking white."	27
1	Wow, I can't believe you got all that crap for your comment!   I had the same thought as you. I disagree with her, but she remained calm and polite through it all.	27
1	Downvote me if you wish, but this seems made up.   I'd really enjoy some supporting evidence like a police report or a deposition. If it is true, I hope the OP updates the progress of his daughter. The whole thing just sounds too terrifying to be true.	27
1	Everything on the internet is made up.  On that note, that story made me so mad and then so content.	27
1	She says society is sexist &amp; objectifies women, yet her blouse is unbuttoned and you can see her bra and big cleavage. She even got two revolver tats directly on her cleavage. She made the choice to do this to draw attention to her breasts. She objectified herself. If she says its the white patriarchy that brainwashed her to do it, she's admitting SHES NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HER OWN CHOICES WHATSOEVER. She's either a woman making her own decisions or she's a mumbling slave controlled by the "influences" of the culture. You can't be both.	27
1	Yeah, none of that ever happened.	27
1	As someone who hates feminists: fuck you. Men deserve rights too.	27
1	tldr feminazis assault anon and claim he was a pedo, try to take his kid away, police arrest him and feminazis, he gets money from them after court	27
1	It's a great point, though. You can't say a country with a tiny black minority is doing as great a job integrating them as a country where nearly 1 out of every 6 people is black.  That's like saying that North Korea doesn't have any race riots, so we need to find out how they do it.	27
1	You aren't describing feminism, pretty sure that's just an egalitarian. As much as you would like to equate those values with feminism, sadly, that is just simply not the case these days.	27
1	Everything on 4chan is made up, especially if it's real.	27
1	&gt; Feminist, at the core of it all, believe in equality. They believe that men and women are equal and thus should be treated equally in all aspects of life. From employment and pay wage to personal respect and responsibility, a woman should be seen and treated as one would see and treat a male.   That is literally the definition of egalitarianism. If Feminism isn't focused on women it wouldn't be called Feminism.	27
1	Lol they cleared him of a prior DUI because of this?? /r/thathappened	27
1	"Being a feminist is like being a fireman in a city with no fires"  FUCKING OWNED!	27
1	Even if this is fake, I just got a raging hard on from reading it.	27
1	A typo doesn't make a story fake	27
1	Seriously. Expungement takes a few months and a few hundred dollars.	27
1	Can you do this with anything? (Have a misdemeanor assault from when I was 18... high-school fight stuff that has haunted me.)	27
1	Fake or not, I still got a justice boner too	27
1	Everyone bitching about this being fake - can you all just shut up and appreciate this incredible literature?	27
1	Not sure. Maybe because women usually don't ever get sentences even remotely this long for crimes like homicide? So I guess it could be a pussypassdenied in that respect, since she was sentenced as if she were a man.	27
1	I don't give a shit if that's fake that felt great to read	27
1	4chan itself is made up. 4chan doesn't actually exist.	27
1	Everyone other than you is made up.	27
1	Yes, because it doesn't work that way.  The police literally have nothing to do with it.	27
1	State laws are going to vary.  In some places you can have it expunged or pardoned.	27
1	It's also 100% bullshit.  Dude claims cops expunged his previous DUI conviction, which cops can't do.  He also claims to have been awarded a 280k judgement from a criminal case.	27
1	It's bullshit.  At least the ending of it.    1.  You can't sue the police for arresting you in this situation.  They are covered by law as acting "in good faith" and they would know that so there was no threat of a lawsuit.  2.  The police can't expunge anything.  They have nothing to do with the procedure.  3.  He claims the judge sentenced the men to 6 months for assault and awarded him 280k.  You can't be awarded damages during a criminal trial.	27
1	it was a civil suit, not a criminal one.	27
1	I agree with everything except your point #1. You could definitely sue for false arrest if this story was true (which it isn't) because even a cursory investigation would have revealed that the guy was her stepfather.   It would be like saying you couldn't sue for false arrest if you were pulled over and accused of stealing your own car. Of course you could.	27
1	He said they offered to testify for him etc, so it's sounds like he meant it was still pre-trial even though he stated things a little unclearly.  In which case, a DUI charge could be very easily done away with.  Having been through the legal system, I know first hand about deals that this would pale in comparison to.  Shit, setting aside law to get what they want is SOP, Google 5K1.1 and/or Rule 35.    That said, I'm pretty sure the whole story is horseshit anyway, just pointing out that providing favors or assistance to LEOs in return for favors is not only very common, but in some cases enshrined in law.	27
1	Heh heh, [over 9000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBtpyeLxVkI) sins eh?	27
1	Needs more context. She seems calm. He doesn't. I'm leaning toward him just being an asshole.	27
1	"There's a reason we don't steal stuff."    boom	27
1	Not if it hadn't gone to court yet.  They would need the officer there to get a guilty verdict and they could arrange for that officer to just not show up.  Bam, DUI avoided.  I'm pretty sure this story is true because I know things like this happen since it happened to me.  My experience was very similar to his except in mine the police murdered me and then fed me to the feminist leader.  I have never been the same since and my family misses me terribly.	27
1	I'm leaning against.  When he told her, "You don't . . . know me," did you notice that none of them (including the girl speaking) protested that she hadn't said anything offensive about him?  That's because she did say something insulting and she knew it.  I am not going to go so far as to assume she deserved a smack.  There is no way to know that from watching this video.  But it does seem certain she wasn't just minding her own business before he went off.	27
1	That's the point. Ignore all these retards, 4chan is for fun.	27
1	I agree with this dude and I'm like, "Fuck dude. Go easy, bruh."	27
1	I think being overweight is what ruined her life. .. and that my friends is a choice! Height .. is not!	27
1	Fattie got her fee fees hurt	27
1	Ah, yes. Having your weight pointed out over the internet truly is a life-ruining event.	27
1	This post honestly made my morning. Hilarious how the one comment said that he should feel like a piece of shit lmfao	27
1	http://www.reddit.com/r/ImGoingToHellForThis/comments/36z47e/when_his_height_starts_with_5/  Feels like we've covered this one already, team - tall vs weight comment and all.	27
1	She even looks like a pig.	27
1	Well if the shoe fits   Well I guess sorta fits if she can cram that toe pillow in a shoe	27
1	that part is just genetics	27
1	Suicide is a horrible thing, but maybe if a random comment from a toal stranger is enough for you to end it all you just don't have what it takes	27
1	[I can't help it.  It's my genetics](http://i.imgur.com/otAlXmW.png)  Edit: some say NSFL	27
1	What's wrong with more?	27
1	Should I eat more or less to get taller?	27
1	That's how spoiled those people are. She can make fun of something a person has absolutely no control about, but nobody can make fun of her choices (I doubt she's fat because of a *condishun*).	27
1	Ruined her life? How fragile and sheltered are you? I was told my grandpa died and I still went to work that day. What kind of glass world are you living in?	27
1	Well, you can get taller... it's only a ~80k USD surgery!  Counting calories and not going to McDumb costs more, obviously.	27
1	Wait, being like... 5'10'' or 5'11'' is short now?	27
1	She might cut herself.....a slice of cheesecake.	27
1	Oh yeah.   5' 11-1/2"? GTFO you can't date me.  I'm 70 pounds overweight? WTF why won't you date me?	27
1	But that's Diet Coke in her fridge, she's clearly watches her weight	27
1	https://youtu.be/assZ9bcucmQ?t=20s	27
1	Some cross it to r/fatlogic	27
1	And on the plus side, we'll save enough food to feed a starving family.	27
1	She's cutting back to two slices a day... Cuts cake down the middle and throws away knife.	27
1	A slice? What are you crazy. She'll have two while cakes from the cheesecake factory.	27
1	Of course, but maybe...	27
1	The sad thing is that it actually is.  edit: I'm 5'3, I obviously don't think it's short at all, I would literally kill to be that height. From what women say, the sad thing is that it actually IS considered short.	27
1	That face she's making doesn't help her case.	27
1	And it's only incredibly painful.	27
1	It just got a bit dark... haha. Depression is a serious matter but this chick was just being a little bitch.	27
1	How the tables have tabled.	27
1	And enough water to supply 500 families for a year.  Wait, not water...sprite, I meant sprite.	27
1	Thanks for the update, I didn't already know that.	27
1	As a tall guy this is something that will pisses me off to no end.	27
1	But she deserves it. Plus, it's an anonymous person. No one is attacking any specific person here	27
1	&gt; Gaining or losing weight can be easier or harder depending on genetics though.  And gaining and losing height is impossible, regardless of genetics.	27
1	Well this might not be much of a consolation for you, but I find 5'2-5'5 guys so fucking hot!!! So if you ever turn gay . . . ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)	27
1	I was very close to my grandad. He fought in WW2 and was a professor in a university. When i got word that he had passed away when i was walking to class one day. I took a moment to remember him and kept walking to class because thats what he would have wanted me to do. People act like their world ends if they have a bad hair day.	27
1	I thought around 5 10 was about average?    What planet does she live on?	27

1	Vietnam is awesome. At 5'5 I'm taller than most dudes here.	27
1	That's the problem with fat people today	27
1	Probably with women in general.   edit: So I talk about fat people and everyone upvotes me. Then I talk about women... spoiled brats	27
1	NSFL? Yikes!   [Eye bleach!](http://i.imgur.com/SOJ4dGX.jpg)     I am a robit.	27
1	as a 5'5" guy i dont know how many times in high school some fat broad near me would say in passing they dont date short guys, then like look to me and be like Sorry! as if that was gonna happen. yet when i say back, its okay i dont date fat chicks they act as if i was more rude then they were initially lol get fucked fatties. atleast im shredded	27
1	What makes him racist?	27
1	to be fair, my world does end when i have a bad hair day	27
1	&gt;Okay faggot, you can stop growing now  keks were had. I can always rely on 4chan to make me feel better. :')	27
1	Liking short people is my one good deed so I'm gonna have to say no . . .	27
1	haha It's almost ironic how that works.   upvote from me though.	27
1	Don't they have to break both your legs and let the bones regrow or something like that? That much money, that much pain, and I don't see it making you more than a couple inches taller... not worth it.	27
1	Isn't the only surgery available for that breaking, stretching and rehealing the bone over and over and  maxes out at like 2-3" and is incredibly painful	27
1	I hope your having a bad hair day now.	27
1	What exactly do you think the person you replied to said?	27
1	I just don't understand how a woman would seriously rather date someone 19 inches taller than them than date someone who is just a few inches taller or the same height. Taller women and short men suffer from this mentality.	27
1	Not only is this a double standard but on top of that you can do something about your weight BUT NOT ABOUT YOUR FUCKING HEIGHT    this shit really makes me angry	27
1	Some people just want to see the world burn.	27
1	When she's ready, tell her she's too short.	27
1	Because all women aren't like that, not even fucking close. Many more fat people have that characteristic than do women.  This is a decent sub, but I question my subscription when it turns into flat-out hate for all women. Why does anyone want to read that, are they THAT fucking bitter? I come here to see people denied at attempts to abuse special privilege, not to be a general misogynist.	27
1	And you don't want to be mistaken for a pedophile in public.	27
1	People get bitter for reasons.	27
1	Haha, stupid fat cunt got told.	27
1	I get the feeling that whenever people mention height you almost always perceive them to have a smirk on their face	27
1	They're like Bob Ross dogs, that's awesome!	27
1	23 and that immature, there's no hope for her. RIP	27
1	I've learned most fattys drink diet soda because they feel it tastes sweeter	27
1	with "life ruined" she probably means a lot of twitterers bashing her for that post and cyberbully her now. remember, to teenagers everything is the end of the world.	27
1	Their taste buds are so overwhelmed with the taste of sugar it almost makes sense.  I drank soda for a long time and stopped and only drink water now. I still get them once or twice a month and never realized just how sweet they are. I can barely handle the sweetness of one soda.	27

0	Would a guy be justified in pushing another man through a bunch of desks because he threw tea in his face?	27
0	Uh huh. And if the girl hit a desk and broke her neck would ya'll still be cheering?  Sorry but violence isn't the right response to having tea thrown at you.	27
0	legally, I don't think so.  It is clearly an escalation of the violence and a reasonable person would likely conclude the use of force was not in response to an immediate threat, but rather a retaliation for a relatively minor assault that was already over.  The use of force in self-defense generally loses justification once the threat has ended.	27

0	It kinda goes both ways now that I think about it.  On one hand it kinda was a pass, on the other saying a woman should've been beat up isn't in the spirit of the subreddit.  I don't think it was a pass overall because she never got what she wanted and humiliated herself publicly.	27
0	Yes, I'd have been expelled behaving like that.	27
0	Hey, I know that room! Been there before for a false-DUI, right after I'd gotten out of the hospital for surgery!	27
0	You're still making assumptions.  Not every bouncer is cookie cutter the same.  Also you're still insulting me for some reason.  Why are you so angry?	27
0	Then stop clicking on it.	27
0	I only clicked on it once, this one. Dumbass.	27
0	Boo boo, sorry your butt hurts. Anyway, fighting with some kid I don't know in an thread about tits isn't my thing, so find someone else to flirt with	27
0	With your mom? Yep	27
0	I did see your point... and then I didn't care	27
0	It was an obvious and predictable joke without any creativity.	27
0	Nope, in that situation, I'd go and tell the proper authority. You can be a reactionary idiot if you'd like, though.	27
0	Its also pathetic to hide behind your actions as an excuse for equality. Something this sub loves to do. If you believe this is an appropriate response in any context then you have issues.	27
0	You're not worth talking to.  Running out of points so all you're doing is trying to insult me.  At least you know you're wrong by now	27
0	I agree. He was imposing his will because he could. She acted stupid, but she really didn't do anything.	27
0	i thot it was pre cool	27
0	r u sure doe?	27
0	Prison is where you go for sentences longer than a year. Under a year, you go to jail.	27
0	bitch got what she deserved	27
0	[You're right, here's a doge looking into a mirror.](http://imgur.com/gallery/KGBsEpN)	27
0	I don't think she learned anything and won't. Now she will hate the court system and see it as biased. In her opinion, some old white dude fucked her over.	27
0	The point is knowingly breaking the law gets you punished.	27
0	How about we calm ourselves?	27
0	Uhh...she was smiling the whole time. That, coupled with her body language, and her snide remark show how she wasn't taking this seriously at all. Immature people like that need to be taught a tough lesson.	27
0	She flicked him off, so he decided to punish her.	27
0	That's how sentences are determined, Einstein.  It's often a question of what is needed to ensure this person learns from their mistakes.  A person crying and apologizing is more likely to learn from their ordeal and thus get a lighter sentence than someone who is laughing and playing around.  It being against the law is irrelevant.	27
0	It's the attitude. You don't act cutsie and act like you shouldn't care to a judge. He's taking it serious, you should too and not give attitude. Good on him for raising it.	27
0	what a stupid comment.	27
0	I disagree, anyone who wants to act like this in a court setting should be taught a lesson... do you want ignorant people making a mockery of the united states court system?	27
0	You misunderstand. I was replying to your complaint about the downvotes.	27
0	perfect maybe if she hates the court system enough she will STAY THE FUCK OUT OF IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Jesus I feel like the people commenting on abuse of power are a bunch of low lifes that are mad that they have to pay for their DUI....	27
0	&gt;Last time I checked the people of reddit are what build subs up not mods.  The only thing you have to offer is nothing. Not a thing. Please start a sub of your choice. You can start a sub right now.   No clue what your problem is in the context of my post about about banning a racist.   Feel free to look at yourself in a mirror and come back for a chat.	27
0	No, he's threatening the kid with kidnapping and theft. The judge does not deserve respect. The judge lives off of the money forcefully taken from other people. A real judge can get people to pay him without using the violence of the state to collect his wages.	27
0	Best of luck to the new Mod that has taken it over. If we can help out here on their sub we will.	27
0	sadly are you kidding me? the judge should have been on trial. how dare you stick a appendage at me. boo fucking ho deal with it.	27
0	I wouldn't even act like that for a sealtbelt ticket.  He already did her a favor giving her an ROR of the second count.   I have no sympathy for people who have issues with authority.	27
0	No, and a sensible person would not draw that conclusion from the exchange above.	27
0	What part of her giving the court the finger did you miss? Are you being a white knight? Fucking comedy.	27
0	And yet another white knight.	27
0	I agree with you totally. She had her ass handed to her and rightly so.	27
0	What bit of her flipping the finger did you miss?	27
0	What part of stupid are you? Please by all means explain what power was abused in your mind.	27
0	This doesn't belong here.	27
0	Hard to forget it when it's posted every other fucking day.	27
0	Hell, they're crazy. Probably won't remember you. Knock yourself out.  EDIT: Downvotes. Bahahahaha! Some of my best experiences and stories are with crazies. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Go hide behind your mamas' skirts -- leave the crazies to me...	27
0	Mayan you should go outside for a few weeks. Get some sun and some perspective.	27
0	Why is this a pussy pass. This is just a story of some fucking asshole who called the cops on a drunk girl. Fuck, this subreddit has no direction or purpose anymore.	27
0	Good advice vagina_fang.  I'm on it.	27
0	Again what part of stupid are you? What context? Is it because the person has a pussy? And the judge is male?  &gt;How the fuck is that reasonable?  You brake the law you get punished. If you mock the law once caught shits and giggles happen.	27
0	&gt;should send my guys to black bag you  You have no guys. None. I am not sure which movie you think you are living in but pure comedy on your part.  I am not an american, thank fuck, and fyi you stupid fucks are .	27
0	Write a journal of your adventure and email me at vagina_fang@cuntpipe.org	27
0	&gt;stop calling everybody who disagrees with you a "whiteknight"  100% will do when you stop using as an argument the term autistic as an insult.   &gt;She was simply dumb  I 100% agree that she was a fucking idiot. But because her gender was female does not excuse that.  And once again what part of stupid are you? You bring drugs into this discourse.   &gt;She was simply dumb which I would primarily attribute to drug abuse  So that makes it okay?  One last time. What part of stupid are you?	27
0	Oh man.  Cyber rape.  I can get with that shit.  I have an idea.   I just bought a 3d printer. (That's actually the truth). Scan your dick, send me the .stl file, and I'll print it,   Then hire an ex-rapist to chase me with it. We will see who comes out on top.  It'll most likely be you.  ;)	27
0	Sorry, you have been downvoted to hell. I kind of agree with you. The girl was too fucked out of her mind to even consider the consequences of her actions, let alone attempt to use her gender to her advantage.	27
0	&gt;Her friend got sucker punched then stomped on for lollygagging  FTFY.  That second girl wasn't PPD, that was an over the top reaction because Miss Whale saw an opportunity for a cheap shot.	27
0	She's a Desert 8	27
0	As if men and women are different.	27
0	Jokes about "sticking it in crazy" aside, this actually sounds like there could be some mental  illness at play, which makes me sad.  Unexplainable  outbursts like this  often get America's mentally ill put into the penal system  when often what they need is treatment!  :(	27
0	What the fuck do you mean "somehow gets arrested"? Of the shit she did, how in the hell would she avoid getting arrested? AND her picture gets to be plastered here for everyone to see.  Forget the story, her picture being on her makes this 100x more worse.	27
0	She still got arrested. A guy would get arrested for this too. She didn't attempt to cheat the system by being a girl, she was high and probably on other sorts of drugs, she probably had no clue what she was doing.	27
0	Yeah but she didn't try and cheat the system by being a pretty girl, that girl was all sorts of fucked up.  I agree his original comment was pretty stupid but I don't think this belongs here either.	27
0	What a faggot. I would have at least thrown her a fuck first before I called 911	27
0	As if I needed another reason to leave this dry ass state.	27
0	I read it as a bit tongue in cheek.  Pretty sure he's poking fun at everyone; the guy, the girl and the police.	27
0	Would I feel that he should also be arrested? Yes.	27
0	Yeah if this scenario played at in my dorm... Well she wouldn't have been arrested.   Also why does everyone on this sub think that every girl to have ever had sex says that they got raped afterwards?	27
0	The stupid is strong in you. Very strong.	27
0	Blow me, I stand by it. Calling the cops on any drunk people for being loud is just hypocrisy. You know you're fucking loud too.	27
0	That bitch has some thunder thighs.	27
0	I've been around meth quite a bit and I don't think I've ever seen the come down make someone sleepy.	27
0	Was the guy gay?	27
0	Shes a Denver 6.5, tops	27
0	I would have given him the benefit of the doubt except there was a recorded interview with a detective where the officer asks point blank "do you think she could consent" and he answer with "no". That was admission of guilt that he knew better the second time. The first count we found him not guilty because she was awake then, but he without a doubt had sex after she passed out. He admitted it.	27
0	Implying there's anything good about being a stoner.	27
0	fuck your shitty ancient repost	27
0	Less posts is fine by me, this whole fucking place is reposts, voted to the top	27
0	Guy was smart but damn she is hot!!	27
0	I will in at lunch when I get the time	27
0	That why we ruled not guilty on the first count (the first sexual encounter), but then she asked to leave. It is after this request that she passes out and wakes up with him on top her. She is incapacitated. It is the fact that she asked to leave in conjunction with his admission later on to the detective that convinced us to render a guilty on the second count (second sexual encounter).	27
0	Thats code for : bullshit.	27
0	I'm  sorry to say, bu this isn't a pussypass. It has nothing to do with her gender, just her being an absolute twat. Normally, it would be considered a denial, but there was no attempt at preferential treatment due to gender.	27
0	The only good thing about this place is the low cost of living	27
0	Who the *fuck* called her a stoner?	27
0	i remember reading his website that was titled something along the lines of "greatest thing ever".	27
0	[Ha!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCMjBiT3H9A)	27
0	How does this have anything to do with this sub?	27
0	I hate how everybody's response is 'GOOD JOB for calling the cops, and not trying to get freaky with her!'. It's not like someone breaking into your home isn't alarming or anything	27
0	as a woman she most likely thought she could get away with tossing her drink in a guy's face. She probably has even gotten away with it before. Thus the pussy pass, his tossing her to the ground as any guy would fully expect to have done to him was the denial.	27
0	I'm with you.	27
0	Because if he WAS guilty he could go on to do worse or harm his accusors. Obviously he's not, but you can't treat one differently from any other. If a murderer was let free and killed someone, people would be asking why he was able to walk around free.	27
0	FFS OP - How many times does this need to be posted here?	27
0	damn she was fucking hot too.	27
0	The person initiating is by definition also consenting.  It's not really all that complicated.	27
0	Why did it take part over state lines as part of a criminal enterprise?  No.  So no.	27
0	He can't press charges. The DA can.	27
0	Correct.  No means no.  Maybe I misunderstood the situation we're talking about.  I was under the impression the woman never withdrew consent -- but later regretted decisions she had willingly and enthusiastically made while high on meth.  And that having been high was used as a "she couldn't have given consent".  And to that, it is my opinion that if I'm to be held responsible for my decisions for example to drive while drunk -- she should also be responsible for the decisions she made while high on meth.  But if she did in fact withdraw consent, that changes everything.	27
0	Don't know why you're getting downvoted, it's pretty basic.  He was being held until trial, a necessary precaution to protect the public in case he is guilty.  This is what happens every single time.  It's why bail exists.  Bailing someone out is taking responsibility for someone else's actions, and by paying the monetary amount you demonstrate the ability to do so.  OP is just pandering to the subreddit, but you're absolutely right, dude.	27
0	If you had reasonable suspicion that i did such a thing then yeah, i should be. The police didn't know the girls conspired to do this, as far as they knew, thirteen girls had been raped by one person and letting him walk free until a trial would result in them being blamed if he raped another girl. This is basic law.	27
0	I a,more try sure a civil suit is not a "charge" legally speaking.	27
0	FUCK YOUR ATTENTION STEALING ALLCAPS TITLE FOR YOUR SHITTY STOLEN COMPILATION VIDEO, KARMAWHORE	27
0	I'd like the ACLU to step in here if it comes down to that.	27
0	You should see a therapist.	27
0	Where are you seeing it's clear they made it up?  I don't see many stories indicating that.	27
0	You're part of the problem.	27
0	A random accusation doesn't pass as probable cause. A dead body found in my house, or multiple accusers coming forward, or a severely beaten person coming forward does.	27
0	Generally they look for bruising/scratches/cuts on the victim, or  generally any sign of obvious attack.	27
0	It'll probably get removed so mirror it elsewhere too	27
0	I...dont think thats feminism. I dont think thats anything.	27
0	Damn all that was unnecessary.	27
0	This is all completely unnecessary.	27
0	Yeah, but that was a sucker punch.	27
0	Although it was pretty nice to see those dudes not give in to that woman's game, they probably should have called the cops to get her out. I'm not sure if there's any legal ramification that can come from doing what they did (there probably is for that chick's sucker punch), but it all would be avoided with some LEOs forcing them out.  Edit: this is the most conservative comment I've ever had downvoted.	27
0	she was walking away when that fat bitch came at her, that was unnecessary, I woulda been swinging on that fact chick if I were there. especially after she stomped her head when she was already down, I woulda fuckin cracked that bitch	27
0	This was too much lol.Especially that 2nd girl.Kicking someone's head while they are lying down?For real?That's just cruel.	27
0	No. Her back was turned. That was a sucker punch.	27
0	Jesus. Me thinks this subreddit needs to grow up.	27
0	There's s a difference between thinking some people are bad regardless of gender and being the sexist self righteous assholes reddit already thinks you are	27
0	I thought this sub was for vids of girls getting beat up	27
0	she stomped her head when she was unconscious, i cant think of a lot of scenarios where this is a good decision	27
0	To be fair when I made my reply to willblaze I thought it was in a COMPLETELY different comment thread. For this thread I probably would have said something else.	27
0	Is this a joke? 9 Extracurriculars? I did none. 3 Varsity sports? I wrestled...I also dropped out in 10th grade and talked my way into college (with good SATs admittedly) 6 years later.	27
0	she mentions several times that the article was satire...	27
0	"Just to get into this amazing schools." How would she know how amazing they are?	27
0	Good on ya for banning racists.	27
0	This sub has gone to shit. Cya and thanks for the cake.	27
0	Also, girls and guys have different state championships so unless you thought I was a girl this makes no sense to ask me if I was a state champ that year. Everything is not an argument, I was just trying to share my experience with you and I was off by a few details. No need to nit pick it a part and try to find fallacies in what I have to say.	27
0	Yeah this stupid cunt has been posted here before. Almost all the content in his video is from this sub.  We have nothing to do with /r/TheRedPill as a sub. The funny bit is a true red piller would never make a video like that.  As about as pathetic as it gets.	27
0	Stop posting this shit here. Every single video in there has been posted numerous times here. Some pretentious beta twat wrapping them all together reaks of agenda.  No true red piller would even consider making any video like that. You got the philosophy wrong.	27
0	no. we avoid that shit. to much drama.	27
0	to me screamed oppulence and obnoxiousness  I still realize its not fit for this sub though	27
0	&gt; I don't need to link you because I already did.  Is this a joke?   &gt;It isn't fair for girls to compete in wrestling with guys and you are a cunt.  Is this a bigger joke? There are actual female state champions and 'female wrestling' doesn't exist anywhere that I know of.  http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/highschool-prep-rally/arkansas-crowns-first-female-state-wrestling-champion-193432201.html  You are a moron and have no clue what you are talking about.	27
0	Because she maintained a 4.5 gpa and had great test scores? That's pretty fucking difficult to do. Or was it because she was well spoken and had the guts to voice what a lot of students are thinking?	27
0	LOL you wrote an entire essay trying to defend your comment and you literally failed to provide a valid argument the entire time. The judge was simply disciplining her because he (and anyone with eyes) could obviously see that she wasn't taking anything seriously... nobody should sympathize for a spoiled brat.. at no point did she show "disdain." You should do some soul searching and understand the real reason why you are upset.. maybe because he was being culturally insensitive and you are sensitive to that because you are of spanish decent.. or you are a ghetto hood rat that listened in English class. Hope you find your inner peace some day my friend. :)	27
0	A lot of students do not think that. A 4.5 GPA is not hard to get or maintain, and a lot of students graduate with that and still do not get into their top colleges since many students are qualified with their GPA but not ECs.  She is obnoxious because she blames everyone but herself because she thinks she is the only person who is correct.	27
0	Of course I did. it has been posted in this sub many times. Again I ask what part of stupid are you?	27
0	&gt; A 4.5 GPA is not hard to get or maintain  You do realize that 4.0 is normally the highest you can get, right? And going above that requires a significant amount of extra work?	27
0	I'd say a 4.5 OUT OF a 4.0 is VERY difficult to get and maintain, especially with the extra curriculars that she did on the side. As far as I can tell, she's not blaming the schools per se. She's just fed up with the trend of schools occasionally choosing diversity over merit. And again, you're not getting the point that she turned it into a satirical piece of writing. But I'll just let you go on and keep defending your shitty point. ;-)	27
0	See what I've said about 4.5/4.0 in another comment. She isn't special. Her EC is though. She isn't being satirical. She is bitchy. 53% of people agree with me.	27
0	You seem to be irrationally upset about this.	27
0	&gt; Somehow I doubt they'd mock the 20 year old sorority girl for  We weren't talking about scrutiny from the law.	27
0	You get higher than 4.0 by taking Honors classes. Difficult classes.  "Which a good student should have no trouble keeping." &lt;-- bullshit	27
0	Turned off when I saw the cringey as fuck redpill brand.   Get a life dude.	27
0	Wow such a classic, i only see this video every single time i visit this sub. Can you please post something original?	27
0	So what is a guy's reasoning for doing it to a friend? Can't be that he thinks he will get away with it just for having a cunt.	27
0	I disagree, we're way beyond the involuntary reaction...  He may not have been totally aware she was a girl, but that punch was for stopping the sound and it isn't an involuntary reaction, it was meant to cause distress and pain to the person who was bothering him...	27
0	Wait...for the girl? **I** would be surprised. If a man did it then of course attempted rape would be on the charges, though.	27
0	Hence the pass was denied.	27
0	This isn't real retards	27
0	To me, this subreddit is JusticePorn but when women use their gender as a right to avoid justice.  A man punching the fuck out of a woman after a prank simply doesn't fill this category. Please don't infest what should be a wonderful and pleasant subreddit with misogeny.	27
0	what the hell misogeny has to do with this??  please, you don't like it, fine.. you don't think it's a pussypassdenied, good! but please do it for a good reason, not just because you want to see misogeny here...	27
0	the fact is she's not even worried: she does not try to run or to keep her distances from him.  I would, if I just pulled off something like that... even to a friend of mine...  what would you do if you jokingly punch a friend from the back? just stand there or protect yourself/take a step back/run away?	27
0	What I meant is that it pretty much promotes it and I don't want this subreddit mistaken for /r/Misogynyfetish. Should've been a bit more clear with my wording.	27
0	While I disagree with some peoples opinion that this sub is another version of "beating women"  Some of the submissions certainly are making it easy for them to think that	27
0	I hereby make you moderator...it is written.	27
0	Perfect egalitarianism in action. She did a shitty thing and he, half asleep and without even considering her gender, punched her.	27
0	Might not be fake. War vet here,  jumped up and swung at my own mother just like this right after deployment ended.	27
0	This how you get tinnitus for the rest of your life. Really sad.	27
0	Oh wow there's only 3 people that use reddit? I could care less if I get downvoted.. the people that downvote me are most likely drug addicts that are mad they have to pay for their drug tickets.	27
0	Hence the pussy pass "I'm a woman, men should make me happy" is denied.	27
0	yeah, because putting someone in a cage for 24 years at the expense of the taxpayer is a great way to rehabilitates someone.  shit, putting anyone in a cage for that long is monumentally evil. I can't believe so many people support it	27
0	It's not PPD, it's nothing, the video is fake.  Ad hominem also does not make me want to debate with you. You have a good day.	27
0	Good fuck off and die in prison cunt, think about the person you killed every single day.	27
0	And there is the problem with the American prison system. For profit prison are a horrible idea.	27
0	You've assumed she does not. ASSumed!	27
0	She killed somebody because of her mistakes, she deserves whatever she gets.	27
0	Again you ignore it, and that's because you're wrong and know you're wrong, and nothing more.  Don't try to paint me the bad guy because you think any video where a woman is hit belongs here. I'm not the one trying to make something out of nothing here.  But yeah, have a good one. Ignorance is bliss.	27
0	Circlejerk here is almost as bad as /r/atheism. I got downvoted to hell over there for saying someone was close-minded, after they said that all Christians are assholes that see everything as a chance to covert people (regarding the earthquake in Nepal).	27
0	Yeah I had to unsub. Ive always heard this sub was bad but this is the first time Ive ever just been blown away by it. Biiiit too much hyperbole here lol.	27
0	While I totally agree that this woman dumb as fuck. She should not be jailed for this post only. Freedom to express discontent with a situation and SAYING you want to kill people does not constitute a crime. I'd say the exact same thing about a man in this situation.	27
0	First time in many years that I've seen any judge actually use common sense and do the right thing.	27
0	You'd be surprised how aware your body is while you sleep. A child placed in the center of the bed with two parents on the outside works pretty damn well. Your body knows there's a child there, you're not going to roll over onto it.	27
0	I don't agree with Twitchh, but I think he's talking more about the changes the baby will experience rather than memories. That baby started breastfeeding, now it will never be breastfed again etc	27
0	I thought there would be previous to the insemination.  This sounds like a contract deal or something to that effect.	27
0	Usually you can't sign away rights to a human who doesn't exist yet, so it would be interesting to see the contract she broke, considering she wasn't supposed to have the baby baptized without permission.	27
0	Hello!   You are reading this because you clearly have no idea how to use sarcasm, so please stop.   Thank you.	27
0	Why does race have to be in the title? I'm sure if the roles were reversed it would just say two women ran over a man	27
0	But if two black women ran over a white man should it still be a hate crime? That's all I'm gettin at	27
0	So all the black on white violence isn't hate crimes. The knockout game for instance.	27
0	I feel conflicted here, but hear me out.    No question,  these are some cunts.  They didn't run over the guy.  The driver should get the chair.    They made racists comments, and possibly egged him on?  How is that criminal? Not reporting it I can see as criminal, sure.  But outside of being toothless bigots, what crime did they commit?	27
0	Eh... this should be deleted. It's a complex tale...	27
0	&gt; white people due to the fact we are 90% (roughly) of the US population.  You'd think with all the people bitching about illegal immigrants from South America the number would be slightly lower.	27
0	Decisions are illusory in a deterministic universe.	27
0	I think that /r/justiceporn would be more suitable given the subject.  :P	27
0	It was a joke.  :/	27
0	I mentioned it was a joke because it involves sex.	27
0	"white knight" isn't remotely over-used in this forum. It's only like 80% of all words. Let's work to get it up to a healthy 90-95% of comments.  And, to clarify, I'm not "white knighting" here. it's not a synonym for everything.	27
0	At 48 the pussy was no where near good enough for a pussy pass anyway.	27
0	And hurting a little girl is a bitch move.  Eidt: reddit does it again, you sick fucks love beating your ladies don't you.	27
0	Of course I would, assaulting someone for no reason is a bitch move.	27
0	Under no circumstances do you *ever* go on stage when someone is performing, and you *especially* do not try to play bump-ass with them while they're performing. She got what she had coming.	27
0	Yep, thats what security is for. Taking a cheap shot at a little girl just make you a bitch. Security knows how to handle this shit, not the drugged up, low iq, dead beat, washed out, wanna be rapper.	27
0	Not that it matters that much, but, Airman, Soldier, Sailor and Marine are generally capitalized when talking about the U.S. military profession:  "I was an Airman for 15 years, while my friend, Dave, is a Marine and Melanie has been a Sailor since 1998."  ...as opposed to...  "We don't have enough soldiers to continue the war; they all quit and are working as sailors, now."	27
0	Leave it to a black chick to try and pull off some shit like this. I'll tell you. I think having criminal Minds are normal in black culture	27
0	is that the teacher at the back relaxing and watching the all thing?...	27
0	Speaking of different threads, is this the same mentally challenged blob from the black Hebrew video where the dumbass gets arrested?	27
0	The system? That is hereditary genetics.	27
0	I found him, guys! I found the southern white middle class religious male!	27
0	&gt; Can you imagine that teachers life?  Sitting in a room and getting paid probably 50-60k + benefits and a pension do to nothing? I'll take her lazy ass useless job and you can feel sorry for me for the same money and responsibilities.  Edit: If it sucks so bad for her, why doesn't she take her skills and education elsewhere? Because they aren't valuable and she has a sweet deal. Anyone else who hates their job and has an education and talents would try to find different work, but she is aware that the free market pays far less than a teacher's union supported job.	27
0	Oh, I apologize. I was merely making an unfounded claim from bias.	27
0	&gt; Bc there is no money. That is the reason the US education system is one of the worst in the world.  You should really read more before you say things that stupid. We spend the most per capita.   http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-education-spending-tops-global-list-study-shows/  We can take this discussion back up when you have a vague clue what you are talking about.  I welcome your citations to the contrary, or acceptance that you don't know what you are talking about.	27
0	That's alright, it happens. Unless you're trying to indicate I'm doing the same [which](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_A) [is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence) [simply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_intelligence) [untrue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect).	27
0	I'm not going to do your research for you when you keep making completely incorrect points. You feel free to prove my cited assertions incorrect. I'm guessing you learned your logic in public schools.  You can Google and get the median salary. You can then make whatever arbitrary distinctions you like from it. You have cited nothing.	27
0	Came here for a funny tirade about how someone hit someone, walked into a troll feeding about teachers unions...blah.	27
0	&gt; Maybe thats why you cant even hold a conversation.  You will be having a conversation when you provide citations for your points. So far you have contributed nothing except an unfounded viewpoint and an unwillingness to educating yourself on a subject that you have twice shown to be incredibly ignorant about.	27
0	Holy hell like landscaping? Which people work far harder at, and get less than half the money for? How about fast food work? How about daycare centers? Many, many people work far harder for FAR less.  I work for myself, but I'd gladly cut my business down to stuff I could do in the off hours to get that sweet pension and benefit package.	27
0	Wtf is the teacher doing just sitting there?	27
0	You might be right but he did seem in physical control of himself.	27
0	Phenomenal post! I imagine it's because he's less concerned about educating others and more because he's an angry racist looking for ways to justify his beliefs.	27
0	Dude teachers definitely make over 30K. This isn't the 90's. I have a lot of friends that are young teachers, in a southern state, so it's not like cost of living is high. They make 40's and 50's. Not great, but definitely pretty sweet considering that after their first couple of years creating lesson plans and shit, they pretty much work like half the amount of hours and everyone else.	27
0	It was more like "da fuck is ronk wit u"	27
0	Gotta love those people who think that name calling bolsters their point.	27
0	This sub already has a bad enough name without Stormfronting the shit out of it, jesus fucking christ this isn't coontown	27
0	Well shit. It's like you didn't even read the article.	27
0	How about the part where she fought the charge instead of apologizing and moving on like the man did.	27
0	DUH , YOU DUMB FUCK , FOOTBALL IS GREAT  . LoL Rofl  since your the idiot who spotted it you get your trophy! hahahahahehehehehahah	27
0	And  there's the teacher...... Just watching.	27
0	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-e-cordell/why-dont-more-men-ask-for_b_3503742.html  Not sure where you got your facts from dude.	27
0	Your karma on this comment leads me to believe that the answer to your question is "no"... most of the people in this thread do not realize that.	27
0	In theory, the homemaker could win the lottery, or stumble onto big bag of cash. In reality, though, 10 years worth of pay raises and promotions takes 10 years to achieve. That's not even taking into account that employers tend to shy away from hiring folks with long periods of unemployment on their resumes.	27
0	Fucking spoken like a fucking man with a dirty fucking house,  and no fucking kids. Fuck.  Edit: Fucking fuck.	27
0	EDIT: Sounded ruder than I meant it to. I saw your point, but I disagree with how you arrived at it.	27
0	I thought it was Louisiana before I read the article. Punctuation is everything.	27
0	In the article it says about 47% of the women work now what about the other 53% of women who actually stayed home to raise the children? Do they get tossed out ? How would that work?	27
0	Looks like the neckbeard patrol is out in force downvoting you for DARING to dissent.  How...womanly of them.  Your reasoning is completely valid, and is basically the same as my post, which I see now will get downvoted into oblivion because how dare anyone suggest that there's a difference of opinion.  Better get rid of it, based on emotional knee-jerk reactions rather than discuss it and examine it logically.  Fucking hypocrites.	27
0	Doesn't surprise me that an active member of the GH community loves watching women get beaten up.	27
0	Well a couple of couples I know have that exact setup.  The woman would have the kid and stay home to raise the kid from birth. And the kids is still under 10 years old. So you aren't able to leave them alone  Edit: there is definitely merit to having the mother stay home to raise the kid as opposed to a stranger who could molest or beat the kid	27
0	Why the down votes for a valid question? Don't be a bunch of pussies.	27
0	Not to change the discussion but I will ask you what do you think has a better chance to happen. A caring parent beating and molesting their kids or a non caring stranger beating and molesting a baby	27
0	Why are you salty? Sound like a sorry guy who got took	27
0	I am not whining I am just calling out pussies and of course none of them man enough to own it.	27
0	Not over protective. I am asking a serious adult question. You are just a woman hating bitch.	27
0	In all honesty do you really believe a stranger would care about a kid they are just taking care of as a job? Be honest. Then again asking someone to be honest on here is a joke	27
0	You're subscribed to /r/rpussypassdenied let's not point fingers as to who hates women because while you may be pointing one at someone else you have three more pointed right back at yourself.	27
0	No one I just have seen too much news to trust people that I don't know. Besides it is just lazy to pass your kids off.	27
0	Prepare yourself for an avalanche of down-votes. The neckbeards are out in force today.	27
0	How long have you been here and how many videos are of women actually trying to use their gender to get out of shit vs a woman getting fucked up for having a big mouth?	27
0	I never said parents could do no harm. I said caring parents. I also never caregivers were bad people. I just don't trust people I don't know. Trust is like respect it has to be earned. But this has nothing to do with the thread.	27
0	Oh no I don't give a shit what you do with your kids. I would just like to be a good parent and raise my own kid not have someone else do it. That's all.	27
0	You have no idea about his personal life but you know you would be mad if you were him? lol	27
0	You and I know nothing about his personal life so how could I know how I would feel?	27
0	This comment thread is actually the dumbest thing I've ever read.	27
0	The point is that you can't take one persons opinion as a representation of an entire group	27
0	Again not whining kid but ok	27
0	[MFW is see a pussy pass denied](http://imgur.com/qS3NjxK)	27
0	Oh no my feefees are hurt because you neck beards don't like me	27
0	You tell me exactly what I am not correct.	27
0	Oh damn grammar nazi. The most devastating argument in the universe.	27
0	To be fair, Los Angeles is in California.	27
0	Nope, the show pays all rulings. And she actually gets money for appearing on the show.   This is pretty much the opposite of a PPD.	27
0	I'm not disagreeing with that.  I'm just saying that it would end alimony in LA.  The mods could always flair this with "All of California"(I'll be messaging them after this to see if they'll flair it) and that would fix that problem.	27
0	I don't understand why people like this don't just comply. By resisting and making the search process more difficult, they just raise suspicion and encourage officers to use force and suspect illegal activity. It's this stupid woman's own fault she was tased. If she just went along with it, the whole ordeal would be over in 30 minutes, but now that she fucked everything up, there's probably going to be a whole legal process taking months.  Moral of the story, if you've got nothing to hide then don't act like you DO have something to hide.	27
0	Nah, for me it was looking like she was just walking in the general direction of a trashcan and he randomly pushed her.	27
0	It's fucking Jameis Winston. All things considered, I wouldn't be surprised if he did rape her	27
0	She has mental problems. I still hate cyclists. This kids is also an attention whore, just walk away asshole.	27
0	And I'd say she also got a pussy pass if anything. If it was a guy splashing that drink on another guy there would be a fist fight and it would be considered self defense.	27
0	Hahahah.  What an idiot.	27
0	Anyone see how disgusting her teeth are?	27
0	the fucking gums on the second one from the right are huge. makes me want to remove those teeth for a proper gummer	27
0	&gt;Ms. Cooke said, adding that she has already gone through the first phase of physical training in the entrance stages of applying to be a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent  That fatty has done no physical training whatsoever. She fucked her career totally for any form of LE regardless of whether the officers were right or not.   Stupid cunt served herself the denial.	27
0	[I like this version better](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/895/704/ffd.gif)	27
0	She could have gone if she wanted to the supervisor said so himself. She couldn't leave with the car though	27
0	It could be argued that she consented to the K-9 search when she said they have 20 minutes to get there.	27
0	I don't care if it is or isn't gender related, the cunt was being a cunt and got her shit rocked, it brings a gentle warmth to my heart. Makes me wish I became a cop instead...	27
0	3 minutes in, that sounded like a chorus of angels.  Well, that or a piggy squealing. One or the other.	27

0	Bwahaha! Dumb bitch. Guess that "law enforcement management degree" failed to teach her common sense!	27
0	Hate to tell you this dumbass but nobody's rights were violated.	27
0	The logic in that is astounding, and the number of upvotes is saaaaaad.	27
0	I love these "I know my rights and I can do what I want" videos, these people don't seem to realize that regardless of the badge and the pledge to "serve the public" these are essentially a group of armed men. You have the rights they allow you have until you are safely away. I'm not saying thats right or ok but it is what it is.	27
0	"ugh, hey idiot."  Sorry, not interested in reading further.  If you think you can behave like grown-ups do, get back to me.	27
0	Logical? ...sure. But perfect? Definitely not.	27
0	I'm going to choose to believe this is real	27
0	It seemed to me that it fit in with PPD. She seemed like she was entitled and was going to tell the cops exactly what was going to happen and they put her in her place. Am I wrong?	27
0	Cops have enough problems to deal with, when some stupid fat piece of shit won't sit quietly and cooperate she gonna get rocked.	27
0	Seems a little bitter to me.	27
0	Try that out with a cop and let me know how that goes for you. They lawfully detained her and then interfered with a peace officer. She was certainly not within her rights to obstruct the police. Now she has a case.  You belong in /r/whitekniting. Good day.	27
0	She wasn't detained. She had every right to leave, every opportunity to leave, and was ultimately ordered to leave and she refused. You might not like it but you don't have a right to drive and you don't have fettered access to the roads.  She was fucking with the cops, not the other way around. They didn't drag her out of her car and shoot her. She walked up to two cops, started running her mouth and got shut down.  The world isn't out to get you. Turn off the Fox News every once in a while.  Reality hits you hard bro.	27
0	You obviously didn't watch the video and just want to argue. You're delusional as fuck.	27
0	I did watch the video, both before I posted it and several time since. Where have I been factually inaccurate? I think we have a difference of opinion, which is fine, but we don't have a difference of fact.  They asked her to leave them alone. She wouldn't. She got taxed. Those are facts which aren't in dispute.  Since they didn't find anything in her car they may not prosecute her for interference with a police officer, assaulting law enforcement, and refusing a lawful order.  Relax buddy, it is just a video, she isn't your sister.	27
0	If I get pulled over, most of the time it's cuz I did something wrong. Using all the shit I've seen on the Internet it seems like a good idea to waste 10 minutes of my time instead of getting rocked. If u got nothing to hide, cooperate, they'll thank you for your time and send you on your way.	27
0	No one cares what you think, fatty.	27
0	So many 14 year olds in here. She got shut down because she showed contempt to the court. That's why she was booked with contempt of court. It's not because the judge was personally offended - the judge isn't just a guy sitting there, he represents the court and disrespecting him in most instances is disrespecting the court. I know you're 14 and don't want to do what mom says, but when you retards grow up - if that ever happens - you'll understand. Probably not though.	27
0	&gt; ONLY POST IF A WOMAN ATTEMPTS TO USE HER GENDER TO GAIN ADVANTAGE/AVOID REPERCUSSION, AND IS DENIED THAT ADVANTAGE.  Stupid rule, rightfully disregarded. If it was actually followed there would be about 4 videos in this entire sub. Most uses of the pussypass are *implicit*.	27
0	No. Through genes as well.	27
0	Some of you really have an unhealthy obsession with your (illusion of) freedom and try to apply it to anything - even against your laws. Maybe they have tasers to offset the vast overestimation of freedom.	27
0	No such thing as implicit pussypass. That would be /r/beatingwomen.  This sub is simple; women *explicitly* trying to use their gender to their advantage and being denied. If a post could be the same with a male or there isn't a clear pussy pass then that shit doesn't belong here.	27
0	"A group of teenagers" are you being willfully ignorant?	27
0	OP, u aware m(9-1)?	27
0	Sure it works... I never said it doesn't. But I was trying to highlight FPH is more concerned about killing the disease via nuclear bombing, while FL is more concerned about therapy and anti-depressants.   Cancer is cancer.	27
0	Yeah, reddit is pretty gullible to believe this.	27
0	I'm 6'3 and wish I wasn't this tall. I have lower back problems, knee problems, and ankle problems... It all came from growing so fast my last two years of high school, my joints just didn't keep up with the rest of my body. People need to take their short stature as a blessing, because you could be 24 and getting surgery on your ankle and lower back.	27
0	A) Not pussy pass  B) The dude is also a fucking moron	27
0	I feel bad for her dog in the car - has to listen to her stupid owner scream like a pig and get traumatized. What is wrong with her? Is she fucking retarded?	27
0	I think you're confused, fph isn't advocating fat people killing themselves, because fat people are already killing themselves with food. If anything fph wants fatties to stop killing themselves with food.	27
0	That's too bad. I don't want you to feel joy.	27
0	Hmm, Barcelona. Well, that sure would explain the [Sagrada Familia](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Sagfampassion.jpg).	27
0	Yeah but I dont hate fat people. Im actually a bit of a chubby chaser. so ill stixk to /r/fatlogic where we make fun of fat assholes and encourage people that break the cycle and want to live a healthier life style.	27
0	Don't you get it? It's all about common sense and less about right or wrong - at that point in time the cops had control. She needed to comply. For her own sake.	27
0	You can't really go against the narrative in this sub, though, obviously. Most of my comments get downvoted by misogynistic twats. I'm totally in favor of denying the pussy pass every time, but these guys just take it to a different level. I'm gonna B out of this sub.	27
0	I can't believe someone gets that much empathy for NOT doing their job. If she's incapable of controlling her students she needs to quit and do something else.	27
0	Nobody's suggesting she should have smashed heads. I don't think she could even if she was allowed to. There's got to be some disciplinary action available to her. This was a shameful dereliction of duty - she didn't even try.	27
0	No if you fight cops on the spot all you get is tased or worse. If there's a systemic rot it needs to be tackled in an organized way. Random people getting their asses busted won't help anything. If you need to fight, fight smart.	27
0	We now know that behaviors of parents can cause certain genes to be expressed in offspring. So by being fat and eating poorly, you are actually changing the gene expression of your offspring and making them more likely to be fat and eat poorly. Regardless of who raises them.	27
0	there is no action other than calling for help on the intercom which is what she did before she sat back down.  they send cops down to correct the issue.  if she gets involved in any other way she is liable.	27
0	This guy is a douche. Sure the other people are stupid for being douches themselves, but a better way to handle it would have been simply stating the double standard, as oppose to attacking the person directly.    just my two cents	27
0	Fair point, but it was frustrating to watch an authority figure just sit there like another student, and not even try to reason with them.	27
0	I agree with him and I'm no hamplanet (will provide proof if requested)  This whole thing has gotten way out of control. I wish that sub would be more like /r/tumblrinaction. I will never condone or support hate.	27
0	"Why am I being detained?" "You looked nervous"  You're getting into semantics for the sake of it bro.	27
0	I can't stand fat people either, but I also can't stand bullies who censor anyone that criticizes their prejudice.	27
0	farsi goes right to left  checkm8'ed, i accept visa/mastercard/upvotes   but yeah, i should have worded it differently with "countries" instead of "languages"	27
0	I know full well there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in public. But you also won't catch me with my shirt off in the street drunkenly arguing with women, or men for that matter.	27
0	That's funny because I'm banned from fatpeoplehate because they didn't like the words I was saying.	27
0	They can dish out the heat but can't take it.	27
0	They don't like being reminded that people are a little more complicated than "fat people baad."	27
0	Unless there's a rule about disagreeing withe the circlejerk, I broke no rules.  [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate/comments/31x7cy/its_good_to_see_that_my_ex_has_moved_on_to_bigger/cq6azcg) the context of the ban, if you're interested.	27

0	sometimes i have no idea why i vote up some comment	27
0	they are aware they are bullying. what about it?     what gives you the authority to speak for a group of people? &gt;If reddit existed 10 years ago, you would be making fun of gay people, but that isn't socially acceptable anymore.	27
0	How is this a pussy pass? This is just a woman being a typical woman and hating short people, she didn't commit a crime and get in trouble for it	27
0	Why is this downvoted?	27
0	Like rain on your wedding day	27
0	I can imagine it.  But you're fat.	27
0	Whelp, it seems disagreeing is against the rules, after all.	27
0	And I like both of you. It's rare to see us shitlords actually being upvoted outside our group	27
0	Those are some impressive mental gymnastics you're pulling off there.  Disagreeing on fatpeoplehate is fine, just don't break the rules, which is not to disagree with fatpeople hate.      I only commented on this because people were talking about being banned from other subs for talking shit about fat people, which is ironic because fatpeople hate does that exact thing.	27
0	I hope your not above age 12... For your own sake.   Really, Get better son...	27
0	Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaah, thats a thing isent it..   Get well son	27
0	I'm saying, if people want to talk about being banned for free speech, they shouldn't look at fatpeoplehate as an example of freedom.	27
0	Pot, meet kettle.	27
0	Because he's likely a shitlord. like most people from FPH	27
0	No, that is not epigenetics, epigenetics is a relatively new field of research. You cannot change your genome or just add/ subtract characteristics, but you can significantly change the expression of your genome. http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/epigenetic-influences-and-disease-895	27

0	&gt;  1. She said that I shouldn't watch Family Guy around my little brothers. They, as a family, watched the entire Breaking Bad series on Netflix.  there's nothing wrong with watchibg Breaking Bad with your family. Other than Family Guy, Breaking Bad is actually of intellectual value.	27

0	That sub is one of the most toxic popular groups around on reddit. I mean if you're not trying to attain 3-5% body fat, they think you're a detriment to society that should die to lower their health care costs. And I'm not exaggerating. Dr. Perry Cox is their god(ok, maybe not so bad)  But I love how they're completely blind to him using the exact phrasing she used in her original post, and just watching the fat rage ensue.	27
0	Her story was true. This has been posted before.	27
0	You just made the same exact joke. How do you not see that you're the neckbeard? You're just recycling the same *epic meme* that's been made three times in a row now.	27
0	No that sub isn't toxic, it's a place completely opposite of the Fat acceptance movement. Two ends of the same spectrum, and honestly if it's okay to make smokers feel bad about killing themselves slowly, why isn't it okay to shame morbidly obese people the same way?	27
0	TIA will get you bounced from certain subreddits, as well.	27
0	At no point in the article did anyone including the woman in question say "women can't be held accountable when they're drunk" she did try to use the defense that she was too intoxicated to remember but gender was never brought up. This isn't PPD and your title is a lie.	27
0	But if I wish all politicians were to be die simultaneously, I'm a terrorist, right?	27
0	Whaaa! My rights! Ohhh my rights! Ohh my rights! Whaaa my rights! My rights! What whaaa! My rights ! Ohhh my rights! My pussy hurts! Oooh my rights! Waaaaa!	27
0	There's a bot they use that checks your post history for certain subs, like FPH, TIA, anything anti-SJW/SRD. It happened to me. I lost a lot of internet points that day, but I shit on every single person who replied to me (until I got banned of course).	27
0	Umm... because we like being free and not having our rights violated. That's kinda the premise of our country.	27
0	Except that it is now illegal for any officer of the law to detain a person while they wait for a k9 unit.  Her property is part of her persons. What they did was illegal, the tasering was uncalled for and brutality.  This woman will sue, and she will easily win.	27
0	I understand your point on the PPD, his title is still a lie though.	27
0	it goes to collections i believe if the ruling remains unpaid after a certain amount of time.	27
0	This is pretty sad really. A child now grows up without her mother figure. Said figure totally drained after using all of her parenting impetus on a man who didn't deserve to die. Yes she was a bit mental, but she had a mothers love. Now there is one dead man, one as-good-as-dead woman, and a severely fucked up child.	27
0	When I read what I wrote I don't understand why you can't grasp what I'm saying. He only got involved because he knew he had a gun and heard women crying. Instead of only saying he just wants to make sure no one gets hurt, he starts arguing with drunkards. He only argues because he is armed. Then when he is chased, he runs across a parking lot and pulls his gun. To me all of that happened because he was armed. This video isn't ppd at all.	27
0	Nah man in my country guns are for losers. No one carries. No one wants to.	27
0	guess again buddy.  Have an upvote, i pity you..	27
0	That's how I know, never had my nose broke but I've seen a few, the guys who box normally reset their nose themselves or have someone in the ring do it for them, depending on how good a job you do depends on how straight it is afterwards and if you go to A&amp;E they'll do a pretty good job. Keep getting your nose repeatedly broke and it starts to flatten.  Been punched multiple times in the nose and the first thing happens after a while is two black eyes or one black eye. The impact on your nose causes your eyes to blacken from bruising.	27
0	border patrol is fucking up too.	27
0	Fuck FPH. I get that this chick is being a shitty fucking person, but fuck everyone in that sub. It's a bunch of fucking degenerates who wouldn't have the balls to say half the vitriol they spit to anyone in real life.	27
0	Would it make you feel better if I call you a sexist pig? I could probably research some better insults.	27
0	I don't see any drugaddicthate subreddits.  also, "FPH is more like chemotherapy, hoping to just get rid of it as aggressively and quickly as possible."  You act like they aren't just weak people trying to feel superior over anybody they can.  Everyone in FPH is living a piece of shit life and they want to find people they describe themselves as "Better than"  they accomplish nothing.	27
0	I'm 5'10“ and I feel slightly more lucky than you.	27
0	"Just do what the people with power say and Dont talk back regardless of whether they are breaking laws."  If cops pulled you over at a DUI checkpoint and then told you they needed to search your car cause they smelled alcohol and stole your laptop out of your car never to be seen again because it is "evidence" would you still be saying that ignorant line?	27
0	Fucking rekt. General rule of thumb: don't argue with cops, you WILL lose.	27
0	Holy shit Shadow the Edgehog, calm down. Thinking that a judge's actions are unjust doesn't make me a mentally handicapped 2edgy4u 14 year old. Your superiority complex is off the fucking charts, but I should've seen that coming in these types of threads. Saying adios shouldn't be contempt of court, but I guess you're one of those weird people who get easily offended :/. Not only was the judge wasting time, but abusing his power as well. If you still don't get this, then I just don't know what to tell you.	27
0	Correct, and if the officer knew the law this video wouldn't be here. The woman knew the law and was rightfully outraged by the officer's unlawful seizure of her property.	27
0	Lol. I wouldnt say "legally denied." Maybe if it was in an actual court of law. It was barely denied at all, considering these shows pay each person money to show up, and they are still no legal repercussions. Oh, and repost.	27
0	this is repost of the third time in this sub.	27
0	So, did you even watch the video?	27
0	The cops contradicted themselves 4 times on the video and manufactured the assault.	27
0	What are the names of these two assholes?  Her mistake was not calling 911 immediately and being more intelligent to frame the arguments correctly.	27
0	Asshole, there are several people here wondering is this a repost.  Why don't you shut the fuck up. boy.	27
0	Are you a 14 year old kid with no live sitting 27/7 on reddit? no, right, i believe you.  Just a no life loser that have to mess with other people shit. get a life.	27
0	Not so fast, she is a fear mongering bitch. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w2ZS231BAQ)	27
0	Has been ruled unconstitutional though.	27
0	Ain't that like a staged show?  is this considered as a real trial in the US?!	27
0	Sorry bud, didn't realise you were already a Fox viewer, carry on.	27
0	Such a fucking white knight, I'm starting to hate this sub.	27
0	Harbouring a good ol' Justice Boner	27
0	Funny that. He is an anarchist until he gets himself in a situation where he needs the establishment.	27
0	Not really. I can get a gun just as easily as in the states I just chose not to. The overall sentiment is we don't want our cops all armed either.	27
0	the actual scary part of this post is the title.  "citizen thinks it has rights"	27
0	then don't comment lol	27
0	Plenty of men gave this sloot shots of liquid...on her face!  It's called a "Facial".	27
0	&gt; Are you one of those idiots who thinks Islamic terror doesn't exist?  Put it this way the American government spends trillions of dollars to destroy a group of mercenaries in a dessert pit and the war still isn't over.  Ever think the threat might be overblown and that Pirro getting on the news and saying that sort of shit is just propaganda to dehumanize/embellish the enemy so you'll blindly think they are a threat?	27
0	AFAI got it from the video, he tased her after he started moving her away from the area and she started struggling with the officer.  Still no PP or PPD though, except if there's some unwritten rule that cops (or feds in this matter) can't tase a woman, well cause she's woman.	27
0	&gt;And I think you're an imbecile, but let's let the community vote who's right and who's the raging imbecile.  *Tips Fedora* *Takes a swig of grape fruit from a large wine glass* *Gets rejected by female but brushes it off as too nice*  Hahah, go scrape daddy's spunk off of your mothers teeth. You fucking cuck.	27
0	Welcome to the New World Order peasant.	27
0	Sorry, but have you studied the quran? I have both read it and taken courses in college over the study of the Quran, and none of what you are saying is true....	27
0	Reminds me of gym class. Wanting to stop running because of extreme pain, but my teacher berating me to keep running.   "Come on, you can do it!"  Who knew death was fast approaching. Though, I was a fat kid trying to finish the mile before class ended, and you know... I lived.	27
0	&gt;And self-deprecation will get you nowhere on Reddit, man.  I know, I don't care.	27
0	She's kind of cute. Too bad she's crazy.	27
0	Ya know, I enjoyed this subred, until you decided to basically take the feminist apprach and defend any body of a certain sex. This guy is an absolute asshole. The girls did not consent, his DNA matched the rape kit. Seriously guys? You want to defend this dbag?	27
0	Just because he feels bad for her does not make him a white knight. If you think about it. Her game plan was sad and humiliating. She looked like an idiot from the start. She knows she looked stupid and she KNOWS people are over the world are going to be able to watch her look stupid.	27
0	So the judge is going to think about using the social media chat records. Please direct me towards their pussy pass being denied. The kid is still facing charges. This is still considered a pussy pass post.	27
0	Fuck off then cunt. No one will miss you betabitch.	27
0	Says one of the mongoloids who doesn't even know what a pussy pass is. Like I care if I'm missed by fucktards like you.	27
0	Okay. See you then. Bye now. Take care.	27
0	Next you're going to tell me you like fat people.	27
0	Thanks, I appreciate that.  You're real faggy	27
0	K, thanks, bye.	27
0	You too friend! Have a great day! :)	27
0	False.  Stand up for what is right.	27
0	Well he said "I'm not the one."  But if you like "I aint the one" then who am I to tell you what your favorite line is.  ;)	27
0	I didn't realize that an organization comprised of many people could be called a woman.	27
0	You can stand up for what you think is right all you want, but it doesn't change the fact that you'll probably get rekt for doing so.	27
0	When does the interesting bit start? I don't want to watch the full thing.	27
0	first 2 mins.....	27
0	That was definitely the 1 train.	27
0	Keep laughing, maybe you'll have a heart attack, you fat fuck. Kill all hams.	27
0	What's the timestamp for the good part?	27
0	Do you know who the da was who refused to charge him?  An fsu alum,  Right before the national championship game.  Come on man connect the dots	27
0	Thanks, I've been working on it recently. 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏼👍🏽	27
0	I think it was wiped off for a brief second or two, bb.	27
0	His timing of that train door was on fleek!	27
0	Implying I care about Karma you 🚬	27
0	I don't care, I pm'd you because I didn't want to upset any SJW overlords by calling you faggot.   You even screen capped that because you know you'll most likely get upvotes for it and therefore you can fill the emptiness from the missing attention your mother gave you and you can finally feel somewhat accepted.  I pm'd you because you're  a prick.	27
0	What the fuck are you talking about, I said she probably did get entitlement wiped off for a second or two and you took that as me disagreeing with you.    And in one of your other comments you mention me editing a comment which you have just done, probably expecting to reply sooner and then you could go and change it for extra Karma you fucking cunt.	27
0	How much you wanna bet it's a German Shepherd?	27
0	&gt;  You were dumb enough to say that because a large number of people disagree with me, that means I must be wrong.  Must? I said that it is very unlikely, not impossible. Reading comprehension 0/10. Keep going bud, I enjoy listening to stupid teens ramble along.	27
0	we shall go-eth toe to toe in the center of our cells.	27
0	It was a shit post, OP. A swing and a miss. Just accept it and move on. Better luck with your next submission.	27
0	Off course there's a fucking white knight.	27
0	You are blissfully ignorant of how powerful college football is.  But I guess you are going to blindly defend any man at any time so there is no use with arguing with you, it's just like arguing with a feminist lol	27
0	I couldn't agree more. It's mens fault that women think they can act this way.  Stop defending these stupid cunts just because you want to fuck them.	27
0	That's like rape yo	27
0	You are so confident to defend this guy, I actually think that you just hate women. Not a big surprise.  I'll bugger off as there is not really a way to argue with somebody like yourself	27
0	Welp. While I agree the whole situation was escalated and unnecessary I sincerely doubt shes winning any court case.  by her own words  &gt;Now they are trying to put charges on me federally for assaulting an officer when I did it in self defense after he pushed me!!!!!   There's obviously a struggle when shes moved to the car, could assume she tried to turn around or elbow him or some shit. But she admits it in her own words, welp. Good luck have fun.	27
0	Watched the whole thing. Would've made perfect sense if I had only seen the last 2 minutes.	27
0	&gt; I was paraphrasing   Lol. You put the statement in your title in quotation marks. You understand how quotation marks work, no?	27
0	It sounds like a laugh track/canned laughter.  I think people might be getting had on this.	27
0	Most of Reddit is very big on "social justice" as a codeword for a war on the "patriarchy".  Letsnotmeet is a similar hivemind where men are always bad and women always good.  Probably most subs are like that.  Only a few, PPD and TRP coming to mind, are not caught up in that "reject normalcy" crap.	27
0	Good lord, you are just as bad as a feminazi! Don't trying to reason with your ignorance, keep hating on women it'll get you far	27
0	I'm pretty sure cops would want to check someone who has a gun on them to see if they are licensed to do so or if they are out for trouble. Honestly, if an average Joe saw someone with a gun in public, they would be a little unsettled. It's not like you are being raped of your rights because a cop wants to ask for your permit and let you be on your way, it's just their job to enforce the law and protect the citizens.	27
0	First of all, we have a bad name? Didn't know this was actually FPH. Secondly, it was a meant as a new trend called jokes.	27
0	yes but one can easily falsify that, but if you have yourself and 3 officers all concurring that the time is now 02.48pm etc just before turning the camera off it has more credability	27
0	thats what i am saying you idiot, you are protecting yourself from the police. re-read the comment	27
0	Often in live shows like this they use laugh tracks to initiate laughter from the audience.  This is also used in the sense of getting a more accurate level from the audience when it comes to the audio production side.	27
0	I personally think it's ridiculous that people even bring 2nd amendment rights into open carry searches, there's no reason for it, nothing is going to come from it and best case scenario is that after an hour of pointless arguing the cop will just walk away, but what does that prove? When cops ask someone for a permit when they have a loaded AR strapped to their back they're not trying to take away their rights or challenge the 2nd amendment, cops have better things to do than abuse one open carrier's rights, they just want to know why he has a loaded AR on his back and if he's legally allowed to do it	27
0	&gt; I don;'t believe you, prove it.  Stop being a lazy dolt	27
0	&gt;  Find the post and read the article and you will understand.  You don't recall what was said?  I'll find the post, I will, and I'll read it. If I can express what this is supposedly PPD in fewer than 34 words, I'll be disappointed in you.	27
0	You have a real knack of trying to abstract things, linking to your own comment that tells you to look up the article, congratulations for costing me 10 minutes of my life to read that article and find _nothing_ PPD in there.  Why would you even do that?	27
0	/yawn. You have a lot of time on your hands.	27
0	Hahahah stupid cunt. Respect the authoritah!	27
0	I'm pretty sure she had something in that car. Why else would a human act like that? OP's title suggesting she was standing up for her rights is a little fucking stupid.	27
0	after the hearing her belch for 15 seconds straight i was laughing like it was a joke...  sorry	27
0	Heavily downvoted because you were wrong, so there is that.	27
0	there is no question. there is the observed consensus that you and the people agreeing with you were wrong. hence the downvoting. so you couldn't be seen. because you were wrong.	27
0	You are wrong. Detain = arrest. Just like with a traffic stop you were not being detained	27
0	Actually with borders your rights are: let then search things they want to search or don't enter the country	27
0	Definitely not PPD, everyone was wrong in this scenario, she is a stubborn sovereign citizen dumbass that is just begging to be suspected of hiding something, and they are entitled, abusive wannabe cops that couldn't enforce the law right if they fucking tried	27
0	Probable cause is still not necessary to detain.	27
0	Those are the rules. Follow them or don't leave/enter a country	27
0	Because IT's a woman, and women are always, implicitly or explicitly, trying to use their PP. The sooner you learn that, the better.	27
0	Dead people can speak?  Don't be an idiot. On most people tasers aren't deadly and they are not classified a deadly weapon	27
0	I won't argue with an idiot.	27
0	Nope I said and meant idiot. I guess you also consider aspirin, cars and the flu deadly too. Those kill people.  http://definitions.uslegal.com/d/deadly-weapon/	27
0	I disagree with your interpretation of events.  She disobeyed a lawful order and escalated the situation.  That's not defending your rights... she had no right to refuse his order.	27
0	Does this mean peanuts, staircases and wet shower floors are also deadly weapons? They have killed and will kill again.	27
0	It's funny. this guy is one of the people who blow their loads everytime an excessive force situation comes up, and demands police accountability.  Yet, rather than pull some mace out, or a tazer or some other non-l means of defense, he almost killed an unarmed young man who was in a verbal argument with another person.  I mean, he wasn't a black guy so no one would have cared if the cop shot him anyway, but ya.  tldr; /r/irony	27
0	Yes, and that bears no correlation to today.	27
0	Nervousness can not be used as probably cause.  There were cases where an officer pulled over someone for driving properly at the speed limit, with hands at 10 and 2.  He had drugs, but it was thrown out because that is not a reason to stop someone.  So someone acting normal is not probably cause.  And driving up to a Border patrol checkpoint where people have guns and being nervous is normal.	27
0	You are right. There isn't much room for argument. The law is very specific and what "you consider" has no basis in law or the courts.   Carry on with your little circle jerk and sensationalism.	27
0	Well said, and yes I think I referenced the K9 law.  I've seen similar videos and she was clearly given conflicting information, I hope there's a hearing on this.	27
0	I agree with this, well said.	27
0	It's PPD because she thought she could simply disregard the instructions of border patrol officers near the border.  This is typical princess behavior.    She also thought that no one could ever "touch" her.  Did you hear her screaming "you touched me!!!"?  Wow, yes.  They touched you.  She was living in a fantasy world created by feminist rhetoric, believing that she was invincible and untouchable.  She got her comeuppance.	27
0	Possibly, I went over the char limit typing something up, not wanting to redo some text because I was pissed as fuck that the top mod on this fucking sub made me spend 7 minutes chasing an article that proved he was a liar.  So I chopped the title up a bit. Seem ok, [read this debugging comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/comments/35ya92/lets_discuss_border_patrols_and_ppd_i_was_irked/cr9g5g8), tell me where you crash out, and I'll explain. 20 GOTO 10.	27
0	She did wait, they approached her.	27
0	There was another one with a black guy getting his window broken, but he was doing what another guy did (another black guy) almost textbook, which is a shame - I just think people on here might need to sub to some nodonut/copwatch subs.	27
0	I was away for a few days, but came back to a reply from the mod linking - I think I did see some voices, but yeah generally downvoted, like I said, I don't really care, I am just kinda surprised that people are finding it normal to blame the person standing up for their rights ... rather than the abusive cop, I think they'd do this even if it was a guy. Even that crazy guy who was tazed, got up and ran off, I love that video.	27
0	Not a denied pussypass, just someone being an asshole to an idiot on facebook.	27
0	&gt; His point is that after those 5 seconds. The pain subsides. It doesnt keep coursing through her body for a long time, like she was acting.  Having a fat dumb cop lying on your back is enough to make you angry, especially when you know he baited you into it.  Now you're advocating for people who stand up for their rights to remain quiet after being tazed?	27
0	&gt; her contention isn't enough to disrepute the 3 separate officers observation of nervous behavior.  Feel free to link to that law. They do this shit to me all the time when I'm recording. Walk up while fingering their guns and being inherently threatening. When my hands shake, because I'm scared of being beaten and robbed by them (again), they start asking if I'm on drugs or guilty of something. Its bullshit 101 copsucking logic.	27
0	&gt; On most people tasers aren't deadly  Good things cops will use them over and over until you die, even when handcuffed or in custody. Do you read this sub?	27
0	Jesus. Don't implode your lungs as you copsuck with all that force. Get an education before you say dumb shit like this.	27
0	&gt; we're   I didn't realize you were having a tea party with your dolls. Enjoy that.	27
0	She was told she was detained, then not, told she could go anywhere, then immediately he strode towards her and told her to back away, this was baiting her. It's illegal to make someone wait an hour for a k9 unit, there's a whole thing about this.  They were being assholes and bullies, and they made mistakes and when they verdict comes in, we'll have another conversation.	27
0	&gt;  She was asked multiple times to move  Go get the transcript of the recording and post it all, then bold all the orders she was given, then write out to me explaining each one, count them, and tell me how many times, QUANTIFY how many times she was told to move, where and how, and if they were conflicting.	27
0	If those "officers" did nothing wrong, they wouldn't currently be lying about what happened in this situation. Being annoying isn't breaking the law.	27
0	Is using TAILS a sign of being a pedo? lol	27
0	Everyone knows it's the standard that you are going to make a claim that you should post a source otherwise you are just making empty statements. I don't have to look up if there's a quota because you are the one saying they have one. so what I want to know is where YOU are getting your information	27
0	Stop being an idiot making statements with no facts to back them	27
0	Stop being a lazy idiot then	27
0	Stop being fucken moron and making up bullshit and expecting everyone to believe it	27
0	So what?  It's about the attitude, man.	27
0	&gt;  gave her multiple opportunities to leave the situation  Why does she need to leave? They approached her, so you're agreeing with their schoolyard bullshit? Controlling behaviors? bullying tactics?  You heard no conflicting information?  &gt; but they chose to wait for a K9 unit   Oh bless  &gt; They could have searched her car right then and there.  Yeah, but then they have a whole other line to fill out on their report, so why do you think they didn't? You seem grossly misinformed.  &gt; antagonism  Don't be vague, explicitly state what she did.	27
0	I've heard that before. xD lol	27
0	I have multiple degrees. If you had an education your writing might not be so bad	27
0	I have served my country. Have you? Guess you are a coward  Just because you feel something is unjust, doesn't make it so. Talk to me when you have actually done something for this country other than just complain, coward	27
0	I dunno, the cop being fat is on video, and so is him being dumb. You are exposing your own bias.	27
0	This subreddit is rife with folks who just plain don't like women.  I am 100% entertained by the original intent of this subreddit. Women who overstep their socially obligated bounds because they think they get away with it based purely on their gender... but I often see videos and comments that have nothing to do with this and are just examples of abuse.  I find myself hovering over the unsubscribe button at least once a week.	27
0	That girl was an actor, dumbass.	27
0	I'm too lazy to look it up right now, but I know that there was in fact a federal case regarding the whole "looked nervous" bit, and the civilian won that case.  I don't remember where it took place either, but I do remember reading about it and thinking "woohoo, things'll change a little for the better!" and then being sorely disappointed.	27
0	She came back? She didn't leave with the money?	27
0	You are a coward that does nothing for his country and his way of "standing up to authority" is arguing on the internet. Big man  I know you have only tried to insult instead of logically discuss. Big man  I know you are pathetic sniveling fat porkchop in mommies basement with nothing going on in real life. Big man  A quick browse through your history shows a conspiracy theorist that hates cops and abuses psychedelic drugs. Keep doing nothing in life	27
0	Not everyone agrees with the premise, do you understand that? For example, I think the idea of this subreddit is so laughable and ridiculous that it is actually embarrassing. You've got it completely backward; in a world where men dominate women, you complain about women having power. It's unreal.	27
0	I'm pretty sure this was in Nebraska, which does not border any other country. If this woman never left U.S. soil then she never lost any of her constitutional rights.   edit: Was not in Nebraska. I was thinking of the case Rodriquez v US. I'm not sure where the video took place.	27
0	&gt;The orders he gave to her were lawful,  Telling her that she could not taker her car was unlawful.  If she was free to go so was her property.  Unless they have a warrant to search the car it is unlawful.  Sure they are the border patrol and sure they have a right to search things coming across the border but looking at the map she was a couple miles away from the nearest bridge across the border and would have already been cleared by border agents there.  Thus her rights as a citizen take precedence and they need a warrant to search her car and take possession of it.	27
0	Yet another good reason. This was obviously filmed with the girl being an actor who acts that way everytime while the other two mouthbreathers just sit there and get trucked. Its like the point.	27
0	Mayweather teaching the next generation his proven method.  Avoid the men, hit the women.	27
0	A thunderstick is in inflatable plastic stick you bang together to make noise. You can't harm a fly with it. Seems like a bit of an overreaction to punch someone over it, but she was in the wrong. Should have let security deal with it.	27
0	Nobody is ignoring it. I said she was wrong, but the adult thing to do is to let the people responsible for dealing with unruly fans to do their job and remove them. Escalating the situation further is just childish, just like she was acting.	27
0	&gt; This should have been posted as a comment to the original post, it doesn't need it's own post.   What do you mean?  It was days ago, I forgot about it except some other moderator (now just seeing you've posted and opted to click 'acting in "official" capacity' and then not say much) had posted a reply much later and I saw it, spent 7 minutes of my time getting to the bottom of this.  Why should it have been posted as a comment? you trying to bait me?	27
0	She essentially hit him with a pool toy and he decked her.  I'm no white knight, but there are degrees of provocation.  Would you knock someone out if they hit you with a snowball?	27
0	I agree, I hope she wins and it signals to tax-receivers that they have a job to do.	27
0	Who is contesting that? Link to the comment and quote them.  I posit nobody agree with me is contesting that. Why are you making up strawman arguments? Do you not understand the points being made?	27
0	Hey, dickhole, [answer my question and stop being cowardly](https://www.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/comments/35ya92/lets_discuss_border_patrols_and_ppd_i_was_irked/cr9g5g8) - if you didn't understand something, fine, but don't be a hypocrite, take the time to convey something more meaningful yourself. I want to know where you assume the failing is, or if you were in fact the point of failure in this.	27
0	&gt; who just plain don't like women.  I don't doubt that, but I am more astonished that it's people who seem to genuinely to understand how how police work... I mean, this is a NWO wet dream, citizens that cheer on the police as they taze non-compliant citizens who won't be ordered around.	27
0	You're the pathetic one who said you couldn't understand it, now either you're lying, stupid or lazy, which is it?	27
0	No. I love equality as much as the next PPD browser, but read the fucking article. She hit him with an inflatable tube and he punched her in the face.	27
0	Yep cause logic, it's okay to fuck with people as long as you don't do damage. Just keep that shit to your fucking self. Hardest ducking concept I ever dun saw	27
0	Not a weapon, an inflatable tube.   You could beat a child with one of those and they'd just giggle at you.  He clocked her in the face for it.  In this case he was definitely the asshole.	27
0	Keep going to the bottom jackass	27
0	Yes,  you're right,  she's a fucking bitch.  BUT!  Escalating is still Escalating.   If he'd just shoved her away or something this would be a very different conversation.  But "hitting"  someone with a 2oz. blow up tube in no way warrants getting a fist to the jaw.  Im not defending her hitting him, shes a bitch and put her own damn self in a bad situation. But he's still a fucking asshole for bringing it up from no one being hurt,  to someone being hurt.	27
0	There is something called proportinal response.   Granted if something is harsh enough the response you dilver doesnt have to be proportinal but there is still a limit. Someone slaps you? Killing them would not be an acceptable response. Punching them would be.  Someone hits you with a soft object that causes no more pain than a poke then laying them out would be but pushing them would be.  Now if the witnesses are correct in that she punched with object in hand rather than hit with soft object then fine.  Touching someone doesnt warrant such a violent reaction.	27
0	Yep. Used to say "Floyd Mayweather hits woman at warrior's game" or something implying that Mayweather threw the punch.	27
0	Why don't you people learn to not bitch about the stupidest shit	27
0	Welp, I dont know who changed it, but it's been edited.	27
0	Pretty stupid comment. Generalization at best.	27
0	Because its one study and it's not particularly a fact outside of just one study looking at internal dating data.  So if you go by the compartmentalized environment through which the study was done (okcupid),  it's easy  to draw a correlation.  There is simply not enough data to make it a 'fact', hence why it's stupid and a generalization.	27
0	Sigh... I guess for clarity sake,  correlation does not equal causation. In this case,  not even close... Meaning the statement listed above does qualify as a 'generalization',  given that a small sample was used to classify an entire demographic.. But you know.. Reddit != logic	27
0	Did you read anything i wrote?	27
0	You're gonna argue over this while posting what you posted in this thread?	27
0	No, you can't just stop someone indiscriminately for no reason and then use their behavior after they've been illegally stopped to justify reasonable suspicion or probable cause. The Supreme Court has spoken on this. The checkpoints have been deemed legal (with certain restrictions) and if the stopped person decides to admit to something or consent to something, then it's their own fault for waiving their rights. If they assert their rights though, they need to be let go.	27
0	How about you go post racist shit somewhere else.	27
0	Tell me what a Tu Quoque is and why it's wrong. Then I'll tell you.	27
0	Dude, I completely agree with you, fat people are disgusting.	27
0	What?  I said nothing about women's rights.    I just think Mayweather is a bigger pussy than the women he beats.	27
0	And the sample size is way too small to make an overarching statement.  You can downvote me,  but that does not suppress the logic.  It was a generalization,  regardless of if it was a 'statistic'.  Just because something is quantified does not mean it's meaningful. Especially in the context of that guy's statement.	27
0	This has to do with both self-perpetuated negative racial stereotypes as well as a preponderance toward outspoken religious belief.	27
0	I'm curious to know what makes me a moron outside of the irrational response by some of you.	27
0	25 millions accounts on okcupid.  That's not representative of the population at large.  It's a good analysis of how people feel on...ok cupid, and from that perspective,  that's a fair number.  Yet,  to say 'men date like to date black women',  and then validate that statement with a proprietary data set that is specific to a very specific demographic (people who use OKCupid), is not correct.  You can say 'men on okcupid prefer not to date black women'. Like it or not.. That's the case.	27
0	The video is PPD material. She is wrong.	27
0	So the reaction wasn't exactly equal lol not defending this hoe but rather Newton, that analogy doesn't work. This is  a clean case of "you push me, I'll shove back harder".	27
0	&gt;not at the time and place that they are infringing on those rights  Better get busy, you got a lot of boots to lick	27
0	totally agree.  ... but proportionality is a factor both morally and legally. this guy wasn't defending himself from harm, he used extreme violence against a weaker person to "enforce respect" (and ironically should be respected by no-one for doing it)	27

0	arguing about whether or not posts belong is dumb and pointless unless youre a moderator	27
0	And where is the teacher? Would hoodie have been better off just getting up to move? Sure, but she shouldnt have to. Was she wrong in dropping the dumb bitch disrupting class? Definitely not. Will she take a beating for doing it? Probably.	27
0	Who wants to fuck a silverback?	27
0	Nor have you provided any evidence to refute the assertion that you are a cowardly henchman for the parasitic global bankers. You kill people to help them get richer. Fuck you.	27
0	Do you feel like you made a point? Does this post make you feel better?	27
0	It's redundant but it's correct. "it" is used for other animals like dogs, I may get downvoted but unless i'm factually corrected I dont see how i'm wrong here.	27
0	People who are civilized and not racist, are not, because they've never encountered/interacted with them enough.	27
0	This is such an overreaction...that kids just an asshole	27
0	It just sounds odd to me is all. And you're definitely right. It's not incorrect.	27
0	"They" is 100% grammatically incorrect. "They" refers to two or more people.	27
0	Meanwhile your posting history is something to put on a pedestal...	27
0	Not even trying to hide the racism. Basically just saying "blacks are inferior in behavior."	27
0	&gt;any school with lots of blacks  Giving the anecdotal account of a single teacher from one school isn't exactly a reliable citation for such a bold claim.	27
0	Literally you have no concept of sample sizes and why that's important... Im done with this conversation though.  Keep the downvotes coming.	27
0	I... Just...  Fucking hell, I'm not even going to explain why your a fuckface, as it is so obvious already. Enjoy your sweet world of ignorant racism.	27
0	Literally just google video "white girls obnoxious dancing" and I can guarantee you that there will be obnoxious white girls dancing and annoying the fuck out of other people.  Before you even do that response: no, I am not going to spend my night googling for an exact copy of this video with races reversed, because that is ridiculous and I shouldn't have to explain why.	27
0	Yes, an ad hominem fallacy is what is needed.	27
0	I can just as easily Google "white people fighting" and copy a bunch of URLs. What's your fucking point? That blacks are inferior? If so, then you are the definition of a racist.  Even if we ignore the glaring fact that you are a racist who doesn't belong in the 21st century, how the fuck are you gonna fix poor behavior by poor black youth? Berate them for it? Punish them?	27
0	lol, it's a fact, not an opinion.  Advocating... no one can advocate that a red car is red, it's a fact.	27

0	I'm willing to bet the white girl's been bullied before, and as a result, has no idea how to react in normal social situations - let alone a level 1 chimpout. Someone sets on/near her hand, she acts impulsively, niggress will be having back pain the rest of her life.	27
0	From the looks of it, that's a school campus. Pretty top notch security they've got goin' over there.	27
0	Right, so you can just pull someone down and hurt them a whole lot worse...she wasn't trying to step on him	27
0	I used to work in a school with lots of blacks. This is pretty spot on for how they act at any given time. Literally animals.	27
0	yes.some facts are very racist.	27
0	So you're basically saying that a certain race is to be hated or looked down upon, but not everyone does so because they haven't interacted with said race? It's not like it'd set in stone that this race or that race is a pile of shit. Maybe you've just been with individuals of a certain race who were assholes and you decided to group an entire race and associate them as assholes too.	27
0	You really need to shut the fuck up and stop denying reality.  Glad to see your heartbleeding liberal bullshit doesn't fly though, people know you're an idiot.	27

0	You just dodged my question.  What is the solution? Yours seems to be berating them, which doesn't usually work out too well.	27
0	Hey ass clown,  in your haste to make yourself look smarter than you are,  you forgot that I had mentioned that the original Commenter that used the link was the one making the generalization. Are you that fucking stupid? It's in writing. Next time actually read the comments,  instead of trying  to pile on for extra Internet points.  You are the real muppet here.	27
0	Absolutely. Generalizing your beliefs of an entire race to something negative is absolutely not OK just because there are some statistical studies suggesting that the group may be less "civilized" than another.   Rather than simply making it a question of "is a certain race 'bad for society' or if they should be 'punished for their unlawful behavior,'" your thought process should run deeper than that.  Being degrading towards an entire race of people based on a couple of Stormfront copypastas does not help anyone, neither yourself or the ones that are being "uncivilized."	27
0	look at them doing their tribal dance lol!	27
0	Nope, just a year spent as a teacher's aide. And some of the teachers were so pathetic. Kids would be dropping f bombs, getting in shoving and screaming matches, flashing gang signs etc and they would ignore it even though no one could get any work done.	27
0	shut up, nobody cares	27
0	some facts are idiotic too.	27
0	it's become a dominant culture, and it's entirely artificial. it exists to sell these people shoes, rimz, and incarceration on for-profit prisons. so fucking gullible.	27
0	But you know for damn sure that they wouldn't be described as a tribe if the people dancing were, say, Asian tho	27
0	I see why sjws get so much material from this sub.  How do you even get through a day?  Do you leave your house?	27
0	Oh we're calling niggers people now?	27
0	Raw data doesn't,  but intent behind the use of it does. You really are dense.	27
0	No.. But you don't read at all.. Everything you desire is in the comments. I'm not rehashing again. I've explained countless times... Your reading comprehension is quite abhorrent. And the population is 25 millions accounts... Not 65 million you dunce cap. You didn't even read the fucking article. I'm done with you.	27
0	Thats something you're going to have to find out on your own.	27
0	Because rape is crime known for it's successful conviction rates.	27
0	&gt; Holy shit. What is it the feminists are fond of saying? If you've had so much as a sip of beer you're too drunk to give consent, and it's rape?  Definitely a real thing that feminists are fond of saying and in no way an absurdly obvious legend that makes no sense.	27
0	It's an overwhelmingly obvious lie.	27
0	Like most "feminist ideologies" it's literally something just made up by assholes on the Internet who habitually lie about what feminists actually believe	27
0	&gt;In a victim impact statement the 23-year-old serviceman said he was worried about his future as a soldier, adding he was proud of representing the country.  &gt;He said: “The lasting effect of this case will follow me for many years and perhaps the rest of my life.”  &gt;The 24-year-old said: “I was petrified and couldn’t believe this was happening to me. It changed me as a person and I have become a lot quieter and less confident.  &gt;“My family were distraught about the allegations and the worry has been the biggest thing for me.”  Don't drink and fuck. Dumbass.	27
0	&gt; the decades that each of them would have done if they had been found guilty  How are you not just making up stupid bullshit in your head? It's unlikely they would have served decades if they'd *murdered* her. It's completely ridiculous to suggest they'd get decades for rape. Jesus, [the maximum sentence](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/s3_sexual_assault/) is a decade. Christ, you're a lazy, dumb hack.	27
0	Thanks, that vid gave me a semi.	27
0	It has a successful conviction rate because so few cases ever make it to trial. The only cases that get tried are ones with physical evidence, are promptly reported, and promptly investigated.   Trials make up 2% of rape police reports. And as wrong as it sounds, that's the way it has to be. There has to be evidence to toss someone into jail.  Let's not pretend that someone shows up, cries rape, and the accused automatically gets thrown in jail.	27
0	People seem to forget we're trying to evolve out of animal nature	27
0	Oh well, if you say it's *nearly universal,* and add that you really don't like feminists, clearly that satisfies my objection.	27
0	Wow! You've totally convinced me with your eloquently written argument! The swear words especially helped! Thank you!  But on a serious note, yes, it is his fault "some cunt" tried to ruin his life. If he hadn't gotten drunk and fucked her, he wouldn't have been in this position.  It's very simple. Don't drink and drive, don't drink and fuck.	27
0	I very well might be.	27
0	I suppose I'm meant to take statements like these more as pronouncements of faith &amp;ndash; "Jesus Died For Our Sins" &amp;ndash; because as factual assertions they're too ridiculous to even discuss.   Feminists aren't *capable* of rational thought? Not "feminism is wrong" or "feminists are irrational about feminism," no, feminists are *literally not capable of reasoning.*  At this point what are you even left with? You might as well just say feminists worship Satan. There's no daylight anymore between yours and that kind of a position.	27
0	I am not a "false rape accuser defend"er.  Perhaps you should pull ~~that stick~~ *your head* out of your ass and give yourself some time to stop being so butthurt before you go on reddit.	27
0	&gt; You are placing the blame for this on the victim.  No, you're continuing to keep your head up your ass, and are overanalyzing my words.  Did I say it's his fault she made a rape accusation? Did I say she shouldn't be punished?  No. But I do blame him for being stupid enough to put himself in the situation in the first place.  ***DON'T DRINK AND FUCK. IT'S COMMON SENSE.***	27
0	&gt; If feminists were capable of reasoning they wouldn't have become feminists.  But even if you accept the proposition that being a feminist was as crazy as being, say, a Nazi; still clearly most Nazis aren't even diagnosably mentally ill, let alone "incapable of reasoning."  How could it be that *all* of the adherents of an *entire* political standpoint are not only wrong but fundamentally lacking a basic human characteristic, that of reasoning ability?  Seriously, will you just admit that this is just your way of saying "Boo on feminists!" and ditch the stupid factual claims?	27

0	Jesus Christ, this is just incoherent. You're a very foolish man.	27
0	No.  They soldiers never were convicted.	27
0	Colloquially, the phrase 'thrown in jail' refers to a sentence of jail time, not the time spent awaiting trial.  But yes, they were jailed temporarily until they were found innocent of any crimes, just as the justice system is designed to do.	27
0	Yeah, because getting drunk and having sex is such a great idea.	27
0	Per the story, she is 7 months pregnant and this could easily be a shot from her in her third trimester.  Not saying you are wrong, just saying she could have looked different at the time of the incident.	27

0	Degrading remarks to another group based on their place of origin isn't racism?	27
0	Fuck off, we don't need that bullshit here. Stop trying to infect everything.	27
0	&gt; That is literally what they're preaching in schools, groups, what ever.  Name "them." Name the "schools" and "groups" and "what ever." Document that you are not just talking out of your ass and/or seizing on some ambiguous or foolish statement made by some rando.  Sexual assault prevention and education is a huge field. There are literally thousands of books, pamphlets, posters, web pages etc. you should be able to cite to document this "feminists say a drop of alcohol negates consent" fact that is just so *obviously* and *widely* known that *only a high person* could deny.	27

0	Fuck police dogs.  If the police [like shooting peoples dogs so much](https://www.facebook.com/DogsShotbyPolice) ... maybe we shouldn't feel too much for police dogs.  Police dogs are monsters wrapped in fuzz and exterior familiarity.  They are trained to destroy and menace.	27

0	Ohhhhh how I wish this would happen to me	27
0	God dammit, is everyone who posts content in this sub legally retarded?	27
0	How ironic.  Just to analyze this...  &gt;Don't judge him.  Okay, a statement about how we should not judge people...  &gt;He's probably very, very lonely.  Uhh... You realize you're extrapolating extra information from what he said using personal experiences... i.e. judging.	27
0	He said not to judge. Then he judged.	27
0	What else was there to say? You spouted off some judgmental nonsense.	27
0	Yeah, we know half of male redditors dream about this happening to them, but they would talk differently if their dick started changing color  Edit: forgot to add male	27
0	This is the most retarded comment thread I have ever read. I feel raped by reading it.	27
0	Why would you post this here if you agree that it's the opposite of what this sub is? This sub is a retarded mishmash of things that have nothing to do with a chick trying in vain to play the gender card.	27
0	without body cam's how can police give you a good beating?	27
0	I doubt she'd have custody.	27
0	&gt; "I, an ethnic minority woman, cannot be racist or sexist towards white men because racism and sexism describe structures of privilege based on race and gender  I've heard this before, but usually as sarcastic parody of either opportunistic race warrior or genuinely misguided youth.  Firing her would just make her a martyr, not the answer. People need to get in the habit of dealing with this.  Also she looks like [Blackie Lawless](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/12/9c/bc/129cbcb1d7546e35862190c2ba9618cb.jpg) so that's funny.	27
0	What I'm saying is that she should have some time to look in the mirror (like maybe a brief suspension with pay) she might get it right, rather than sending her off on a crusade to reinforce her position. Consider how we handle police who get temporarily mushbrained due to stress. How we choose to deal with people still matters.	27
0	If you know her history better than I do maybe you're right.	27
0	Usually when people say put in a window, they mean like, thrown through it.   I was very disappointed. :/	27
0	I don't feel like doing this.	27
0	I hate when girls do this to me. I'm glad she pleaded	27
0	Agreed. Imagine a situation where she was simply buying a bag of Cheetos and complaining to her girlfriends about the price...  then she gets pimp smacked. And it was all because she said "The price was too high...  Hello!!!! :::head wobble:::" and what that guy heard was "That guy is high as hell Yo!!!" ...	27
0	People of color can't be racist?  Tell that to Al Sharpton and just about every black in the US.	27

0	You're a Beta Buck.	27
0	I'm gonna get downvoted to hell for this.  But whatever.  1: how does a woman overpower a man? 2: if the man gets aroused then he will get a boner, which is the only way intercourse can occur.  3: How the fuck do you sleep through being banged by a woman on top of you?  Like really?  I'm sorry, but I just don't see how a woman can rape a man.  I'm a man, and no woman could rape me.  If one did "rape" me, I'd probably enjoy it.	27
0	I have no idea what youre talking about. Was that comment meant for me?	27
0	Well the language that she uses....makes me think she probably acts a little too badass at times..... she messed with the wrong guy....better education/manners might have helped her....sometimes people take really bad when you call them a bitch....	27
0	&gt;There are border patrol check points miles away from the borders in southern states not just at the border.  And my same point applies.  Once a citizen clears the border their rights as a citizen take precedence.  Setting up a secondary checkpoint miles away to check everyone is improper and unconstitutional.	27
0	&gt;Well illegals and drug dont stop just at the US border.  Yes but our full constitutional rights start right after the border and we have a limited set right at the border.  Fourth amendment rights don't go away just because there is illegal activity somewhere in the nation.	27
0	&gt;So if all the drugs and illegals make it past the border thats it they win? We stop looking?  No, we continue to look using legal and constitutional measures.    The point being that doing a search just because someone is nervous does not fly as probably cause.  It would fly AT the border but once you are past the border you need to do better than that.	27
0	If they were suspicious then the search is not unconstitutional.  And if they found drugs then their suspicion would have been correct.  If not then they missed on that one price to pay for living in this country.	27
0	For the sake of human social evolution please quit using that phrase. It's making us all dumber.	27
0	So what law school did you go to?   For all I know the stuff you are saying could be right or not I just dont care enough to verify.  I am happy the woman got tased though I love when people with shit attitudes get that.	27
0	You people = all of you acting like she had 0 attitude and was just showing off her culture.   That type = typical asshole teenager know-it-all.   None of these things were hard to infer from my post and the surrounding thread. Stop trying to pick it apart and escalate anything higher than need be, thanks.	27

0	Alright man, calm down. I've made a simple statement about some stupid misspelling on a commonly used word. It doesn't make me Satan, or give you the right to be a rude dick about it.	27
0	Agreed. There's just a problem regarding privacy. If a cop is on private property and videoing citizens in their homes, it becomes a little hairy.	27
0	I like towards the end of the video when the other girl submits herself to him and just wants to make him cum.	27

0	Well I guess tonight's the night bitches die.	27
0	She is probably a liberal.  That is the common liberal defense mechanism.	27
0	Same for in here where the woman is being called names?	27
0	“You made a determined and prolonged attempt to weave a picture of deceit to further your ends and you were prepared to make wholly false allegations of attempted rape against these innocent young men."  I know he means innocent in the legal sense, but two soldiers who come home on leave and double team this beautiful flower are not innocent.	27
0	Erections often occur involuntarily during sleep. If you were a man you would know this.	27
0	Wearing a shirt about something unrelated is the same as telling a judge to literally go fuck himself?  You're brilliant. It's clear you're going to keep talking in circles and attempt to speak over someone's head while still looking incredibly ignorant.   Keep thinking she was just exercising her culture by saying adios or whatever.   You can consider this case closed.	27
0	Maybe it has to be thought. If dealt the right way, we can all  apologies when we're wrong	27
0	BRO THIS SHIT IS PERFECT AAAHAHAHAAA "YOU DIDNT SAY NOTHING"	27
0	I love when monkeys fight	27
0	I agree with you. The problem is that a lot of guys will bang anything that moves. Usually guys are the ones chasing women for sex. So when a woman is freely taking the wang it is not a big deal. Just like the woman teachers fucking their students	27
0	What's true is that racists have been shown through studies to generally be less intelligent.	27
0	Im not going to state my IQ like some asshole, but I am pretty intelligent.	27
0	As someone who thinks she made up the story and is 95% full of crap...this just seems a bit far.	27
0	Fuck no.  Jumping is just another way of saying "don't fuck with me, nigga, you'll get fucked up.  If you fuck them up yourself that's great but if you got your boys involvedm.. maybe that nigga shouldn't have talked shit.	27
0	He's a fairly well known libertarian.	27
0	If someone sits on you, you wake up. If you were alive you'd know this.	27
0	Yes, there certainly is. As I said I dont consider myself a racist, I consider myself a race realist. Out of 100% of blacks 10% are genuinely good people, out of that 10% probably 2-5% are more intelligent than I am.	27
0	You can't think of any circumstances where someone might not immediately wake up during the act of rape? Really? A quick Google would have helped you here. And even if they did wake up, are you seriously suggesting that a rape hasn't _already taken place_ if someone wakes during the act? Or is that only the case if it's a man being raped?	27
0	I already wake up when someone touches my bed, so I imagine you'd have to be seriously conked out if you don't notice someone fiddling around with your junk.  But if someone jumps on you like a mechanical bull I guess that's still considered rape.	27
0	Where did you get that info from?  The article says nothing about it, and in her picture she looks pretty damn skinny.  I can see a woman attempting to rape a man, but successfully doing it?  Even if she made it on top it would not be that hard to push/throw her off.  You would have to be pretty damn still for a successful woman raping.	27
0	Well, just because something's natural doesn't mean it's good. I think we, as a species, have evolved past former ways of finding potential mates, or the need for finding potential mates.  Also, women don't look their best for other guys and many will echo that sentiment. That's saying that women are trying to look good just for male attention, which is actually kind of offensive and a very androcentric viewpoint.  However, I do agree that this girl's a complete cunt and that no one should be shamed for looking at someone or something they find attractive, that's fucking stupid	27
0	always some nigger yelling worldstar	27

0	Fuck an eight month sentence for any teenager for punching someone. Just the result of a couple generations of bad parenting and a nanny state.	27
0	That's not radical feminism, radical feminism isn't actually that bad, or anti male at all. [If you're intrested this sums it up pretty well](http://womenshistory.about.com/od/feminism/g/radicalfeminism.htm). What you described is misandry disguised as feminism.	27

0	my family took care of that and i don't bend over to get my ass kissed. that a privileged act and one needs to put effort to bury their face in that golden spot, it's their desire if any... "mate" lol keep dreaming	27
0	To be completely honest I wouldnt give a shit, I would brush you off like I do all radical feminists as you should to me if you dont believe in what I post. Your little switch from race to feminism is completely non fact based, while mine is. Blacks make up a small majority of the population and fill up prisons, commit the most crimes and generally fuck up everything everywhere they go. Look at detroit, look at the now Baltimore, look at Ferguson.	27
0	Oh my god, the british should be exterminated and britain should be repopulated with a better class of people. I can't believe these are the filth the US broke off of. But what do you expect from fuckers who still worship "royalty" in 2015.  That little bitch needs to grow a fucking pair and knock the little cunt out.  I thought the french were an effeminate lot, the british aren't any better.	27
0	&gt; Haha, trust me , you haven't dealt with this type of trash before.   Bullshit. If that girl tried that kind of nonsense in the US, she would have been taught a lesson and knocked out. I still don't understand why that idiot didn't smack her hands away instead of letting her drag him along like a fucking dog on a leash.	27
0	You are completely fucking blind to what is going on, our conversation is over.	27
0	Diversity is increasing and along side that trend the world is getting better regardless of this. The link I provided below shows this, Someone who is "completely fucking vlid"  would not use any data or articles in his claim:  http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272929/charts-thankful  Now I will leave the conversation at that , since you provided no argument and have decided to leave.	27
0	Body builders in general are terrible fighters. Simply Arrogant, but they have potential due to discipline over their body. Always take the trained athlete over the zero conditioning person in any platform. There is so much false info in this thread regarding strength and body mass it's laughable.   Although I'm sure the guy you replied to is laughably stupid lean body mass is a thing. It's just the ratio of fat in your body, but that's it. Doesn't means a thing for fighting or most anything really.	27
0	Or how about we don't punch anyone? I wouldn't punch her, not because she's a girl, but because she's a human. You will always be the better person if you don't resort to violence. Don't fight fire with fire.	27
0	I can't tell if he's trolling or serious or a mixture of both. The "utters" thing is confusing. If I had to choose, I'd say they were all three of them fuckwits.	27
0	No I am not going to check lasts weeks posts. Do a search and see if its in this sub before and read the reddiquette sometime  *Complain about reposts. Just because you have seen it before doesn't mean everyone has. Votes indicate the popularity of a post, so just vote.

0	http://nypost.com/2015/05/20/woman-guilty-of-hate-driven-fatal-subway-shove-gets-24-years/ I see a bit of sasha grey in this photo. But back on topic, after reading the article i felt a bit better about what she did since she killed a muslim for 9/11	27
0	"You were wrong, but hey props for not freaking out while being wrong!"  What?	27
0	Nope, white trash fight, and they are just as equal as these people who are fighting. And by equal I mean worthless	27
0	These caliber of people will never contribute anything to society.	27
0	Don't care, could give a shit, let the orangutans fight!!! We should use that principle in Boston just take all enforcement out for a week and let everyone kill each other then clean up the mess.	27
0	and people think racism is dead...	27
0	...  A bit harsh for a kid that punched someone, isn't it? I punched a kid in the face when I was that age and got detention...	27
0	&gt; The boy is being the better person and resisting fighting back.   That's not called being a better person. It is called being a coward and a pushover.   &gt;  If he had have done, no doubt he would be sentenced too.   No wonder your shit country is shit. Defending yourself is a crime?    Fuck off you worthless fucking faggots. No wonder muslims fucking rape your girls like nothing. Your country is filled with gutless morons.	27
0	You are right. But still. Praising her for staying calm - which should be a minimum standard - is like you're looking for something nice you can say.	27
0	You might find that the sentence was because she failed to obey the court, otherwise I am sure she would have got probation.	27
0	Rational adults don't freak out when they're shown they're wrong.   0% of your assumption applies to 90% of anyone.  I too like to make up statistics out of thin air.	27
0	Props for her for being calm? She's littering stickers and spreading her bullshit.	27
0	Cops have murdered more than one person who pointed a camera at them this year.	27
0	All we need for the police need to start all wearing body cams all the time is for something like this to happen in a very high profile way.	27
0	so what am I supposed to take away from this video, exactly? A feminist makes a shitty point, then a racist counters it with an equally shitty point?	27
0	So, I'm not wrong, just an asshole? I'll take that.	27
0	This sub has hit rock bottom if the people here think this guy is being serious.  This is grade A trolling.	27
0	does this clip exist anywhere without the fucking memes	27
0	You told me to bend over, glad you proved my point in resorting to name calling directly. Patronizing won't get you very far.	27
0	As a feminist... I FUCKIN HATE FEMINATZIES	27
0	haha i'm not a feminist or anything, I just don't understand his point. It was funny, but it was a derailment that came from nowhere.    "Yeah, the countries that you say are better than us are full of white people! Checkmate!" ... it doesn't counter her point at all. It was a non-sequitur that made her laugh.	27
0	I absolutely agree. I'm a liberalist Feminist which means i believe in total equality. No special treatment for women and no special treatment for men. Equality among everyone, period.	27
0	eh, i was going off the comments i read and didnt bother to watch	27
0	-shrug- spent an entire semester studying this shit. That is the explanation given in the book. I think the difference between the two is that although liberal feminism believes in equality for all, it works primarily for the equality of women while not over reaching or blatantly fucking up the fight like the feminazis do.	27
0	Everyone else said it but, I want to also.   This never happened.	27
0	*That's* a great point, but he didn't present it that way. He  baited her with the "The greatest system in the world?" and had her in a corner when she refused to acknowledge that America is great. She could've held her ground and said "Yes, we should take responsibility for what is thus far the greatest system in the world." But she fell for the derailment. Because he's a master trole.	27
0	It wasn't a criminal trial - you misunderstood the whole thing.  Yes, he was mad at the cops in the beginning and threatened to sue them.  He probably could have sued them for false arrest since they had no real probable cause, but that's debatable.  What happened was that the cops agreed to testify on his behalf in his CIVIL suits against the white knights and feminazis.	27
0	I don't think change through bad information is what your really looking for though, is it?	27
0	I just beat (heh) my 4th assault charge. Broke my hand, though.	27
0	They have every right to arrest you during their investigation and can hold you.  They released him once the mother came down and confirmed his identity.  Just because the cop's are wrong when they arrest doesn't automatically qualify for false arrest if it can be demonstrated that they acted in good faith with sufficient probable cause.  If the cop's make shit up or otherwise arrest you without probable cause then that is false arrest.	27
0	Oh really?  I guess until I hear any counter to the contrary. I'm just an asshole.    If you'd like to point out where I'm wrong,  I'm ready to hear it.	27
0	Its about  a woman being publicly hated on. WOOT WOOT FIRE UP THE HATE SUB WERE TAKING RED LINE	27
0	The word is "contempt" fag. Not "content".	27
0	Thats a huge turn off. You try it, if she responds well- she likes it. It will be quite clear if she doesn't like something.	27
0	Is a bro-argument the white equivalent of a [nigga moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhgwy9y5ttA)?	27
0	Judges can award damages in criminal suits and they can assign punishments in civil ones, especially in a case like this where it was a series of criminal acts that led to civil damages.    Source: Just one undergrad law class, so I'm probably not completely correct, but based on that I'm not convinced that it's entirely implausible.	27
0	This totally fucking happened. How did you guys not burst out laughing "DADDY WILL SAVE YOU BABY DON'T WORRY"???  Seems like a fucking trailer for the next Taken movie, Jesus was that embarrassing to read. [/r/cringe](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe)	27
0	It's unfortunate what this subreddit has turned into. Most of the content doesn't even have a pussy pass attempted, this is just turning into a hate breeding ground.  Just scroll down. People in the comments are attack people just for saying they are feminists? And then people are upvoting those people?   Come on guys... think about what image you are portraying here.  Flame me and downvote me too, but I'm unsubbing.	27
0	TIL common sense is "conservative." haha.	27
0	I think he payed her to act that way, no one is that stupid.	27
0	I would think it's representative of most people with nerve endings, which are, strangely enough, required for erections.	27
0	I dunno, she was pretty drunk.	27
0	A week late, but you are right.	27
0	equality bitches :^)	27
0	Then you need to get off the internet and visit the real world.	27
0	The toxicity in this thread is quite bad. it's satisfying that she got shut down, it's good justice but no need to start attacking her.	27
0	But... MUH GENETICS!	27
0	Fair enough, except i've spoken to at least a hundred feminists, all of which fall under this category. This isn't even considering reddit. That'd probably shoot this number into the thousands. They're very vocal and prevalent here.	27
0	Height is actually genetics, not weight. At least she can change her weight. Hobbits can't get taller.	27
0	Well.. if you're a guy, that's pretty short...	27
0	That's not pretty short, that's ridiculously short.	27
0	Probably something to do wit the fat hate trend	27
0	I think I heard somewhere that models do that. Geez I'd never do that. What they did was add some sort of wedge filled with bone (or marrow, can't recall as it was long ago) and waited for the implanted bone to connect with mine.	27
0	Dude, you're the one who said he didn't think 5'3" is short. I'm just telling you like it is, sorry.	27
0	god damn, my highest post ever!!	27
0	Am sure she will forget your hight if you pass with a burger. But be sure you don't get any on you or she might gobble that up aswel	27
0	I think she's kind of cute, but holy fuck that's hilarious.	27
0	Less.  Idk how true this is, but I've heard the reason Americans are shorter than Europeans,  is because we eat too much.   American teens eat too much junk food, and your "growth spurt" burns itself out, and we stop getting taller sooner.  Whereas,  if you have a proper diet,  you'll continue to get taller into your early 20s.   I have no idea if there is any truth to this,  just a rumor I heard once.	27
0	Yea but short guys are still gross.	27
0	It's fucking everywhere... The new /r/atheism	27
0	God job, you missed the joke.   Enjoy your woosh.	27
0	I know. But I'm 23 already. When I was younger I was too busy with stupid games.	27
0	You do realize diet soda doesn't have sugar, right?	27
0	Lol "shredded" http://i.imgur.com/ULGPc5c.jpg	27
0	&gt; He fought in WW2 and was a professor in a university.  Well thank you for that piece of information	27
0	nah  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yENNqRJ2mu0	27
0	why are we celebrating some douchebag being a douchebag to a douchebag  oh because it's /r/pussypassdenied that made it to /r/all because reddit is a terrible place for terrible people	27
0	As an average sized woman (5"3) married to an average sized - and btw gorgeous, athletic, and extremely well endowed man who stands at about 5"9 - all I can think is "Wtf?"  How tall IS this girl?	27
0	we do have quite a few of spys ;(	27
0	Read his edit. He said 5'3" is not short. For a man, it is.	27
0	Saying diet soda is healthy is silly. Soda is not healthy.  Wanna be healthy?  Chill with the sweet drinks. Chill with the processed foods.  Diet sodas have more processed artificial crap than regular shitty sodas.  I think that pure cane sugar is better for you than artificial sweeteners that trick your tastebuds and then your digestive system.  It makes yr body react in unintended ways - it expects sugar/glucose/fructose and gets aspartame or sucralose and your body doesn't know what to do with it.  Bullshit it's better for you.  Just lay off The fat people drinks and you'll be less fat.	27
0	I was made fun of growing up and it made me a bitter adult. Now that I'm an adult and 6'3 and good looking I love reading this kinda shit. Most short guys I know have a chip on their shoulder and were pricks. It's funny as hell when they get all sensitive like little girls.	27
0	"Haha women are dumb"	27
0	Says the king of the manlets	27
0	5' tall women here, if you could also help me figure this out that'd be great. I don't have a height preference at all but most of my most serious relationships have been with guys over 6'. I just thought it was fate/maker/god being funny.	27
0	So many salty short guys in these comments	27
0	I'm 6' 3" what does that make me?	27
0	I'm drowning in puss aparently.. (I really am though thank gaben)	27
0	tbh i was having a super great hair day, but it started to rain here and I dont have an umbrella.	27
0	Eh I mean to each to their own if you have a fetish for short guys, but don't try to argue they're attractive.	27
0	I don't understand why people care so much. It's a personal preference. You're allowed to have them. Men and women alike can hate on fatties all they want too.   Regardless, someone taller tends to be stronger as well so the woman feels safer and their partner is more capable physically (carrying heavier things). They also have an increase in reach capability.   Everyday situation: Tall man lifts big heavy couch. Small woman scurries to vacuum/sweep/retrieve something under it. Teamwork.	27
0	5'5" guy here. Totally reasonable reaction for her to have. I feel somewhat similar about taller girls.  Also grew out of being insecure of my height by around 15 years old.   She should probably go for a jog though.	27
0	Both.  Source: Science	27
0	The pure *hate* in Reddit is becoming ridiculous. She's a teen, they say dumb things - I'm seeing a bunch of stupid shit spewed in this post too. I guess kids are bored and on the Internet.	27
0	I made a comment on genetics. Womp.	27
0	I did, and do understand that, but you're forgetting the times when she's out alone, spewing her ignorance to anyone who will listen, with no counter argument to be heard anywhere.	27
0	What does it have to do with Western society?  Lol fucking idiot	27
0	that's not in fph. any sign of fatness and you get banned. you are thinking of fps or fatlogic	27
0	They still do though.	27
0	Like how addicts can use methodone which if used properly....  End up on it for life.   It's an addiction too, and adding a processed crap drink to your diet to lose weight is ridiculous. It's just another thing for coke and pepsi to sell us. You sound like a shill.	27
0	Doesn't matter when it was taken. He said "in high school."	27
0	It's not just because though. I'm assuming you've never been there and just come up with your own reasons.	27
0	Fucking awsome I love my life	27
0	Lol no. I'm a 5'9 female and I much prefer a guy around 6'2 to one under 6 foot.	27
0	&gt; yet when i say back, its okay i dont date fat chicks they act as if i was more rude then they were initially lol get fucked fatties. atleast im shredded	27
0	Mai kroh Dong is that you?	27
0	Neither of these things are approprate and the point should be to shame her for being an ass without behaving the same exact way.	27
0	6' 1" is the perfect height. Any taller, you're a freak. Any shorter, you're not really a man.	27
0	A) There's nothing from this video that tells you that.  B) Did she then use the fact that she is a woman to try and justify it?  C) You're a sick fuck.	27
0	Well most angry comments here are from offended redditors under 6ft. Just like any thread about penis.  But ya make sure we shame her anyways lol	27
0	At least fat women can change their weight and be better, short "men" should just go into hiding they honestly creep me out	27
0	who is that shes hot man	27
0	Good sleep and sunlight helps too.	27
0	Well you beleive fatties should go to gym, I believe leprechauns so stay a myth.	27
0	Lmao what's it like being looked down on by girls?	27
0	5'6? Lmao have you considered gender reassignment surgery? You'd make a better woman.	27
0	No you misunderstood me, retards are mentally challenged, smurfs are vertically challenged. Both are not desirable and often make people uncomfortable. Honestly the women who breed with these "men" passing on their genes are just as accountable	27
0	Aww is the little midget triggered? Don't worry I'm sure lesbians ADORE you	27
0	Are you implying there is a 'reason' for murder?	27
0	Midget?  I bet you're some fat ass over 250 ibs and only 5'8 at most .	27
0	The sub got popular and jumped the shark into hardcore circlejerk.  You can post literally anything and no matter how logically inconsistent the story or utterly unbelievable the claim it will be greeted like Cesar as long as it's about someone fat.	27
0	Ah yes assume I'm a cockroach and unhealthy like you. It's ok if I were like you I bet I would be insecure too	27
0	Ah yes I'm crazy because I understand that midgets are undesirable. If that's crazy then I guess the whole women's population is too. I know you're all three but Fatties midgets and retards are undesirable get over it.	27
0	People are shaming her because she's talking shit about guy's height, which is predominantly controlled by genetics and minutely by environmental ractors, like oxygen availability. Which to her is a-ok. But when someone mentions something about her weight, which is determined vastly by environmental vs genetic factors, that's ironically completely unacceptable.	27
0	I shame degenerates all the same, fatties and umpa lumpas are just the visible ones. Just because people find you disgusting doesn't mean they're like you, you know?	27
0	It's alright no need to lie and off to the concentration camp with you	27
0	&gt;If the persons overweight then yea she's overweight. However that's no reason for you to be rude or try to change the person as its not your business. By doing so you're being an unnecessary dick. Grow up.   A quick glance at your comment history. I think you need to grow up a bit.	27
0	Idk I can't find one your size, might as well slaughter yourself, you sound like a piggy do you taste like one too?	27
0	Eh I've found fatpeoplehate since then and been enlightened. Wonder why there is no midgethate, they're breeding too much.	27
0	Also I'm surprised you took the time to look through my comment history, thought your be defending a pot of gold or something	27
0	Sadly it's not, but there is other communities in other websites I can point you towards.	27
0	What's wrong with that? Short people, like fat people, are undesirable. Stop shaming people who won't date your degenerate ass.	27
0	Aww it's ok. I'd tell you not to breed, but I doubt no reasonable human being would anyway	27
0	Because you're not a hobbit? Otherwise this story makes no sense.	27
0	Meh midgets fatties gays retards people without limbs, the list expands	27
0	you seem to be trying to deflect the conversation by looking through my comment history. Kind of useless because opinions can change	27
0	i totally agree with the dude and i'm literally drowning in pussy. LITERALLLLLLLYYYYY ^^PLEASE ^^^SEND ^^^^HELP	27
0	This is reddit, they're not out to be a safe haven	27
0	Incredibly stupid, dangerous and illegal to have that type of glass there.  LOL, fuckin construction company owner here freakin out about liability and shit.	27

0	If you had a worse diet your growth would have been stunted.  They fed you well and you were able to realize your fullest abilities.	27
0	I've never seen that particular 2pac video before. When he says "she told me i was to nice" he sounds like a super soft spoken nice guy. Then in the next clip he's clapping his hands telling people you have to fuck these bitches hard and smack that ass.	27
0	we're all the same height... horizontally.	27
0	I hadn't seen it before	27
0	I just like a little bit of [curvy meat](http://i.imgur.com/4hWjr8E.png) (NSFW) instead of skin and bones.   Attacking somebody's taste in body type is pretty pathetic and wreaks of your insecurity.	27
0	I don't get the joke. Or maybe I do and it's just not funny. He said "No we don't" and then had to sign the ticket. It's justice, but it's not funny. Can someone explain to me what I'm missing.	27
0	Actually, you can.   http://www.makemetaller.org/	27
0	He's not racist, it was just a dumb reply. She didn't say that white people make the worst systems, she said that America didn't have the greatest system in the world. He's the one who made it about which colored people are making which kind of systems.	27
0	Basically what I said. I was just mirroring it. I'm not trying to argue or start a debate. There's not much arguing fat people can lose weight. Short people can't get taller.	27
0	I didn't present a version of his question, so I'm not sure what you're asking me. I think America is pretty much on par with or better than the rest of the world as far as racial integration, but "The greatest system in the world?" a wide invitation for criticism.	27
0	The conversation on the whole started as being about race, but at that point in the conversation they were making a general comparison. He re-introduced race and applied it in a way that was not being applied before.	27
0	Sounds like someone is an old ass hat. You're better off not being around other people.	27
0	this girl is like 16... Its probably just something she already saw and is mimicking. Or she means it, but why are we laughing at a 16 yo oppinion. I feel we can be extremely harsh to young people.	27
0	With your panties that tightly wound, I would suggest so.	27
0	Anonymous gets it wrong often enough. They've harassed people that turned out to not be who they thought they were. This is why vigilanteism doesn't work.	27
0	They're fake actually.	27

0	What a fucking stupid response lol. No I'm not but this white boy could beat ur ass u ignorant bitch.	27

0	it wasn't really about rape it was about spontaneous sex… no one plans there day and adds sex time at 730 after work its the idea that you just go for it when the times right not being all robotic about that shit	27
0	Yes, but you don't just assume a female wants a rape fantasy and carry it out without having ever talked to her about it, because talking about it is a turn off to you. No one's talking about scheduling sex.	27
0	Wasn't aware it was a repost, only been here for a couple days. Sorry	27
0	If I had a dollar for every time this was posted	27
0	Or maybe he has an individual opinion that isn't necessarily indicative of a culture containing over 220 million people? Shall I conclude that because you are from the same culture as this woman that you are a belligerent bitch?	27
0	Wait, so hobbits aren't real? Because this is what I actually thought. Sooo embarrassed. Thanks COCK_MURDER, I think some firm words were appropriate in this situation, it will help me to remember in future. You twat.	27
0	Wait, people actually *steal* things Target sells?	27
0	Its... not a joke. cis means not trans. So cisgender means not transgender. Its not that hard to grasp, nor is it offensive or even stupid.	27
0	It's just like the words gay and straight. Just because straight is the overwhelming majority doesn't mean there can't be a word describing the condition of being not gay, aka straight. Its true, nearly all people are cis. That's the norm. Creating the word cisgender doesn't change that, it just describes the condition of not being trans. There is no redefinition of gender, and I don't understand how describing not trans people as cis is hate speech. I don't understand how it's remotely offensive. Are you also offended by the word straight?	27
0	Well, yes, part of her mental illness is hating on people.  It's not really a chosen hate item like a fully-functional drooling Nazi.  She's just insane.  So I can't agree she is 'shitty'.  Her severe illness has led to some type of behavior that is animal and beastly  Not that she shouldn't be sentenced.  Indeed she should be.  Clearly she's batshit insane.  I wouldn't call that shitty.	27
0	She didn't even appear drunk or intoxicated to the point of being unable to operate a motor vehicle.  DUI is a money-making thing, and the cop knows it.  Non-crime, he reels her in, and her way to fight back was dirty as well.  I don't see any pussy-pass or denial here.  Just a couple of scumbags dicking around with bullshit charges against each other.	27
0	OK, this is fucked up. He's a fucking dollar store employee, not a cop. Take their license plate number and call the police. Spraying someone is assault.	27

0	I'm sorry but I'm not clicking on any video titled "the plight of men". In fact I'm downvoting it without watching it. It doesn't belong in this sub and even if it did it's fucking Grade-A fodder for everything that critics of this sub want to mock it for. Use your fucking head, man	27
0	Ruined his life seems a little extreme unless you're referring to ongoing emotional trauma. I could give 2 fucks what my old highschool classmates think. I'm not trying to downplay the situation but it seems to me that he'll be able to find a job, given no charges sticking, even of he has to drive a ways to get there. Seriously fucked up and distressing? Definitely. Life ruined? I'm not so sure. I'm not trying to be argumentative	27
0	You think that was trolling? He said in the video how he's an actual feminist. I'm sure he cares about the real issues. Oh wait, the women couldn't come up with a single legitimate feminine issue	27
0	In theory. Although in practice it depends on the cost of his lawyer.	27
0	I was thinking it was over 9000.	27
0	He's a foreign student from Germany so maybe he never intended on staying here. Hopefully this won't affect him too much if he goes back. (I never heard what his major is.)   One article said that his nondescript looks and low profile meant he actually was able to go unnoticed much of the time, but his college experience certainly wasn't what he surely hoped for.	27
0	I know. People are all like "This guy's a hero." and I'm sitting here like he was acting totally ridiculous. Following them to their car, the way he screamed and stomped his feet. Spraying them and being the first to start something physical. That was awful.	27
0	you sound fat and female	27
0	Good thing he was recording this. He could have gone to jail for slapping this poor defensive less women or just this spoiled little girl.  Real women don't act like this.	27
0	99% lard, 1% perpetual victim.	27
0	"They started it" isn't a valid legal argument.	27
0	Nope. When you can reasonably get away from the situation you are not allowed to just pummel someone.	27
0	I'm not saying he would 100% for sure be convicted in this case. I imagine the chances would be low. But the fact remains that "They started it" isn't a legal argument.	27
0	No problem. Just be on the lookout for shit like that happening, since it seems like it'll be happening more often now. Don't let them fool you too.	27
0	K bro. Try it out and see how it works for ya.	27
0	I think a good lawyer could argue that the more reasonable response would be to back away. He got up in her face which prompted her spitting on him. Maybe a big scary black man getting in her face made her feel threatened. That would be enough to legally shoot him in some states.	27
0	It's a real fucking law dude  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-your-ground_law	27
0	But he started the aggressive move. Do you not see how much closer the camera gets to her face immediately preceding the spitting?	27
0	Reddit is retarded sometimes.	27
0	The wedding was the next weekend.  They stayed married for 32 years until she passed away from chronic bitch disease.	27
0	WHY DID SHE SPIT?!?	27
0	Yeah but he was baiting her pretty hard, I want some backstory	27
0	To be fair, he was instigating that incident and should be arrested for assault. He approached her aggressively before she spit at him. Like most black people, he was looking for a conflict. And with a white woman no less. Pathetic and typical.	27
0	Yeah I guess, some people become very irrational when angry and do stupid things, some people are stupid enough to stand in the way when stupid things are likely to happen, I'm torn	27
0	So he starts off recording her, getting in her face, barraging her with questions, gets spits on, and then goes nuts and starts attacking her. I'm not saying she wasn't acting like a total cunt, but I'm pretty sure he's gonna get in more trouble for 1) initiating the issue and 2) assault.	27
0	Women aren't all the sudden girls when they act like entitled bitches Women do shitty things, get over it. Smh	27
0	Not only that but I'm pretty sure tgis now qualifies as a hate crime.	27
0	My point is that if he hadn't hit and taken that video to the cops, he may have been able to claim that. But he didn't just slap her, he starts beating on her when the video ends, so he wouldn't be able to. And even still, when spitting is considered assault, I do not think they would agree that slapping was self-defense.	27
0	saying "real women don't act like this" seems a bit white knightish	27
0	Yeah I'm not sure is it was restraint. I feel like the slap was good enough, but combating racism with violence like THAT may have been a little too far. However, I get why he would do that and it was satisfying nonetheless.	27
0	it's not just "real women", real people don't act like this	27
0	Just a question - and let me preface by saying this woman is obviously dreadful - but why do black people lose their minds over this pejorative term? Racist terms are shitty, and I prefer never to hear them, but they're all equally mean by nature. You just don't see anyone else lose their shit over racist terms.	27
0	That sub and that site are fucking vile  Edit: Downvote all you want, you know its true motherfuckers :-p	27
0	Sure it is.  State's have their own laws, but the common law definition is pretty well defined.  Ex:   &gt;Simple assault can be distinguished without the intent of injury upon another person. The violation of one's personal space or touching in a way the victim deemed inappropriate can be simple assault.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault#United_States	27
0	Reddit = Cop hate.	27
0	Why censor your post?	27
0	So you agree with me that he would get in trouble ;)	27
0	Yea.  I mean he may be justified, but he wont get a free pass when the cops show up.	27
0	op, where did she try to use her gender to get out of this situation?  Right... she didn't. **NOT PPD**  you can downvote me all you want, send me these stupid PMs but **THIS ISN'T A PPD, GET OVER IT**	27
0	those girls? You mean black girls? can you fucking not  by that logic, every girl would have ran and started crying when the brawl broke, instead, they all jumped in.	27
0	It's nice if the person has a particular point in mind. "By the way, you're praising white people right now..." it just seemed like a bit of fun	27
0	I don't think they took bacteria into account when they included spitting on someone in the range of things that are assault. It's just some fucked up shit you can't do to people unless you pay them an extra $60.	27
0	Wait, did she do it again when the camera was moving around? Sounded like another spitting noise	27
0	How's the unsatisfying life feeling?	27
0	No its not. I seriously don't understand why you SJW come to this sub. Just leave. No one is keeping you here. If a man was acting that way he would have got a way larger ass kicking.	27
0	Well you're dead right about that, but a pea-sized biological weapon is a bit of a stretch...	27
0	She clearly called him a nigger before he started filming. Which is why he started filming.	27
0	Edit: I wasn't saying the man was in the wrong at all. I just think continuing to beat her senseless may have been the wrong move considering the current political climate.	27
0	I mean, it's relevant o the site we're on. Not the thread specifically but I saw a few comments here saying the cops were gonna arrest him because he's black and america cops are assholes.    To each their own I suppose.	27
0	I still say he was sort of asking for it by suddenly getting right up in her face. Do you not see how that happens right before she spits on him?	27
0	And stand your ground is bullshit. I would never expect the law to exonerate me based on "self-defense". If you want to roll those dice then go for it. I personally would try to avoid it.	27
0	Oh, not at all. I'm not defending this woman, she's a fat, ugly, racist cunt and I don't feel bad about seeing her get slapped. But this guy didn't just record her, he continually engaged her, and that can be used as an excuse of provocation.	27
0	Yes...black girls, those on the screen are retarded monkeys.	27
0	Try living around a bunch of monkeys and see if you come out ~~racist~~ hating them.	27
0	Unless you're acting like a nigger.	27
0	Yeah that's what I said ;)  And agreed, switch the story and they would have got his ass jailed straight, and mostly the story going mainstream the media talking of outrageous attack because a dude attacked a girl	27
0	No I was agreeing with you and disagreeing with Evil because they are obviously in a weird bubble of stupid lol	27
0	Yeah I don't know why he brought up race here nobody's make any comment that way. Whatever stupid as you said lol	27
0	Do you really think he just decided to hit her? You don't think for one second, before this video started recording, that she was pushing him and harassing him? Are you that dense. You really think she was in there minding her own sweet business not trying to start shit? If that's the case you're a moron. It's obvious she went in there with her friends trying to start shit. That's the reason she called on her friend when shit happened. Only thing is the friend realised they were fucking with the wrong guy and she didn't do shit.	27
0	Ah, compared to worldstar yeah. At least its not just people getting sucker punched and beaten to within an inch of their life while a bunch of retards scream "worldstar".	27
0	Appropriate reaction from the cops but I can't help to ask myself, especially after all these stories that went mainstream of black people getting gunned down by police officer   Would this situation have turned the same way if the gun owner was black?	27
0	No. I'm not talking about black people in general either, I'm talking about the thugs/niggers that are rampant in my city. They're a special kind of horrible people.	27
0	&gt; such down to earth  So much so that she believes the moon landings to be fake...	27
0	The good ol' days of Chop Suey.  I don't wonder what happened to her.	27
0	F'ed this up a bit ago. Trying again.  I'm up in the air as to whether this is an attempt at a pussypass. He definitely doesn't seemed concerned about her gender. Seems a strong possibility. You tell me.	27
0	I think the worst part is that lazy ass slacktivists like this are given an equal voice with legitimate sociologists, psychologists, and people with degrees in gender or racial studies.   These people have absolutely no message other than getting their voice out there, and do nothing but parrot what other people on the internet say.	27
0	That was the dumbest "game" ever made.  That shit was like what pop's up on a browser page trying to spread awareness about depression, but poorly.	27
0	That's the worst part about any nightlife/club fight video: the chorus of apes ooking and eeking in the background.   Fucking infuriating.   They're perpetual children. They get off on instigation and making things worse, so much. It's like their favorite pastime.   They're mob mentality bullies. They love fucking with people who've already been hurt or fucked up. They love to see if they can piss people off more.	27
0	She was talking shit and not expecting a reaction.   If I start running at the mouth to some volatile dude I'd be prepared for a whack. She assumed they're would be no repercussions.   This is the epitome of ppd.	27
0	Are you here to prove my point?	27
0	Lol. It's cute you see this as "teams". I'm not wasting time on a troll that was almost a month late.	27
0	No, but this isn't a cop she's dealing with. Legality doesn't seem to be a concern here.	27
0	I agree that this video doesn't belong here, but you're a fucking self righteous snitch.  Like you're the only one who sees a problem with this video.  These videos get down voted and shit on in the comments.  Why you got to take it up another level in the chain of command prematurely?  We can handle our own shit.  Fucking snitch.	27
0	These reposts are getting ridiculous, this was literally on the front page yesterday	27
0	Right, except these posts ARE getting down voted and shit on in the comments and AREN'T getting removed.  So yes, you are a self righteous piece of shit thinking you're the only one "inciting change" meanwhile getting nothing done.  Fuck yourself.	27
0	What you're talking about is misogyny. If you think because a woman is saying something you don't like you have the right to hit her, there's something wrong with you.	27
0	Well, we don't know if she was talking shit because the video starts exactly when she's trying to get him to back of. At which point he already seems like a riled up moron. I mean, she probably didn't expect it but it's not a pussy pass because I don't think it warranted him striking her even if she was a guy.	27
0	This is brutal. Not the 'feel good' PPD I come here for. I actually feel bad for the woman. Lacking context of what happened before, it looks legitimately like the dude in the video crossed a line.  Not at all what I come here for. This is a woman getting smacked for little more than telling the dude she doesn't want him around.  Not cool.	27
0	Someone skullfucked her?  edit: you people are fucking morons - it's "rediculous"     &gt;balling her eyes out	27
0	Yeah, how dare those intelligent, opinionated young black men go and peacefully recite scripture and exercise their constitutional rights? They are black, we can't have that shit  Seriously, though, that woman deserves to be arrested and shoved around for starting all that shit, assaulting a couple of them, etc. The guys seemed very peaceful until provoked	27
0	How is this PPD? You have a woman standing up to a group of racist, terroristic morons; and she is pushed away because she stood between them and the camera?! Has this sub been renamed to /r/imafagandhateallwomenforeverything ?	27
0	This is shockingly stupid... I'm unsubbing.	27
0	Do white people alive today really have to carry that guilt / consequence? Is that relevant now? I just kind of feel like it's time to get over it. There are going to be people that say shitty ignorant things, and it has nothing to do with slave owning, whipping people, stealing culture, etc. It's just ignorant people living in a world of preconceived prejudices, which is shitty but it isn't the same as slavery. Again it's appropriate shame this mentality, not assault.	27
0	She had no right to spit in that other black dudes face because she admitted he did nothing wrong but if I don't like someones behaviour and they're acting like a racial stereo type I will not hesitate to call them out on it.It's not hatred of a race it's hatred of someones actions.	27
0	How is this not illegal, it's hate speech right?   Edit: Okay guys, I'm not an American, I don't have an in-depth knowledge of your laws. Regardless these guys are scum.	27
0	She is arrested for disturbing the peace and assault, not for arguing with them. In America people have certain freedoms, and an individual violating them is arrested. In this case, she shoved one of the men when she couldn't get her point across and was arrested for it.	27
0	Man that was so satisfying.	27
0	it's already been deleted, gtfo	27
0	I'd side with the woman before i sided with them.	27
0	Um, they threaten to rape white women.	27
0	I used to think this sub was about women thinking they can get away with slapping someone and getting smacked down. The more I see of it, however, makes it appear to be videos of black men assaulting annoying women, regardless of what the man was doing prior.	27
0	Agreed.  I also hate everyone in this sub.	27
0	The worst thing about the rights granted by the First Amendment is that those rights are given to people we disagree with. But you have to deal with that if you value the basic principles of a free society.	27
0	This was just hilarious, her rape claims were.. I mean you're arguing with someone that can use the race card and no one told you to go bitch at them. Maybe she learned a lesson or maybe she didn't. But the way she acted after the fall... holy shit.	27
0	Everyone in this video deserves a bullet between the eyes.   Or a noose. That's fitting.	27
0	They both should fuck off and die.	27
0	These guys are black Israelites OP. You should look up their other videos before you try to defend them, and give them notoriety by posting them in this sub.	27
0	Everything I said was a fact until the end which was my subjective opinion (that many, many, many people obviously share).   Those first string of statements are 100% fact.   But I forgot, you're the one that don't facts.	27
0	i love how as "empowered" as she thinks she is, her first defense is playing the victim.	27
0	&gt;No.. What you said is not facts. We aren't going into that because I was done with this 'conversation' a week ago.   They are facts.   You are welcome to run away from them.   Toodle-loo.	27
0	lol...there is no point having a discussion about stuff that is a week old.	27
0	So I can tell people I'm going to rape them at a later date and time then? Because that makes sense /s	27
0	Lol, whatever boy.   Facts don't just stop becoming facts because they are "a week old".   See yah!	27
0	I'm 100% sure im not racist. disliking someones actions and hating an entire race are two completely different things. there's even a south park episode that explains this	27
0	You know, an opinion different from ours.	27
0	You're trying *so* hard.	27
0	"Terroristic?" They're retarded. Not terroristic.	27
0	Well, since you obviously run shit here....	27
0	U disturbed peace isn't guaranteed in the constitution, though.	27
0	I absolutely hate the WBC and what they say, but I will defend their right to say it.	27
0	Ah yes,  the 'ol "stoop to their level" angle.	27
0	You call that peaceful?	27
0	I'll answer for him: No.	27
0	&gt; peaceful assembly  Well it's clearly all about what YOU would call peaceful assembly.	27
0	Well that's exactly what they did. Way to keep defending these fucktards.	27
0	Oh please, as if this comment section hasn't already told you how stupid this post was.	27
0	Oh please, have a sense of humor.	27
0	Lol I was jus joshin ya buddy! But still live life :D	27
0	Being able to recognize sarcasm will improve your reddit experience, greatly. Sorry I didn't spell it out. I'll fix that....  S-A-R-C-A-S-M	27
0	they are not just voicing it. they are harassing people who walk by. i've seen them yell out racist shit to people just walking by. that's not legal.	27
0	it's not peaceful and so many idiots on reddit think freedom of speech means you can say whatever you want in public. it does not.	27
0	You don't recall the police attacking protestors? Convenient.  Occupy was physically shut down at the assembly level. You're going off on tangents not related to that. Understandable, you never had a point.	27
0	Haha, yeah.  Each word seemed to have a distinct meaning and got different responses.  In America, everything can pretty much be summed up with "Fuck You!"	27
0	Why is that? For being a fan of topgear?	27
0	I don't know if she hit his bag or him so can't really say for sure that smacking her in the face was justified.	27
0	wtf? yelling out racist shit directed towards specific people who walk by is harassment. have you seen their other videos? they yell profanity at anyone who dares to come up to them to rebut. they basically bait people into arguing. they have some political entity behind them and that's why the cops let them do it. any random guys would be chased off already.	27
0	I can't understand you kids. You make fun of people just for being trans or having triggers or for reacting badly to rape? Who mocks people when they're at their lowest and being treated so awfully that they're haunted by it possibly forever? How do you find that funny in the slightest? This goes way deeper than just having a low bar for humor. Please explain, how do you find any of that funny?	27
0	The other person's comment talks about "toerape" but *I'm* the moron? But yeah, I'm a lobotomized spineless white knight. I still want to understand how rape and triggers could be funny no matter who you are. Beyond my comprehension.	27
0	If you would shut up and let me finish, i can actually work on this response. Please, and thank you.	27
0	Yoe fuckin burnin it you dirty condor	27
0	Just look at his username and post history. His favorite sub is r/coontown and his username is whydoblacksrapealot. It's a pretty safe assumption that this guy is a racist motherfucker.	27
0	Insert additional original witty English phrase here.	27
0	If only the Jews had taken your advice.	27
0	This. Plenty of cops love to yap at, and argue with dipshits. They think they are there to instill their profound wisdom on idiots, thereby curing them of their terminal dumbassery.	27
0	Oh my god. Sorry, I don't have time to explain. Try reading the whole thing again from the top. Maybe read it aloud and go slowly or something, apparently that helps.	27
0	I hope black people watch this and shut the fuck up.	27
0	Yeah, maybe she had committed a hard crime that victimized innocents, like smoking weed.	27
0	Get this man a badge	27
0	I think cops not being vocal about what's happening and what they're doing is exactly why many officers are accused of excessive force when they're doing their jobs just fine.	27
0	Another horde of dumbshits shows up to pretend that police abusing a female has to do with their retarded notion of 'pussy pass'. Cops were abusing their power, pussy pass nothing. Fuck you retards.	27
0	We all know you're the bigger one.	27
0	At first, yes, she would  be. There is a time when reserve air, depleted of oxygen, remains in the airsacs of the lungs. You can push it out, but you aren't taking any in, replacing the depleted oxygen. You can still talk, and even scream. But not for long.	27
0	You can have breathing labored by which you can inhale but not enough, or deeply enough, to replace depleted oxygen.	27
0	I remember that one. There was no issue with the recording until other cops show up, and it was a female officer who told him to put the camera away. I'm not sure why, the cops didn't seem to be doing anything wrong.	27
0	You didnt forget, you probably never knew. Its completely accurate.	27
0	Canada isn't a police state where the cops think their job is to "destroy all resistance". Public relations is part of the job and why we don't have a hate/fear relationship with cops like you Yanks seem to. A few polite words to the bystanders goes a long way toward humanizing the LEOs and disarming the situation.	27
0	You think people never ever get away by resisting?	27
0	What the fuck does this have to do with a pussy pass? It's literally two male teens fighting.  Get this shit outa here you dumb fuck.	27
0	I'd like to see what the black guy did to piss her off.	27
0	While our outspoken friend is a little extreme, I personally believe in the whole "to protect AND serve" motto. I personally believe officers should be approachable and citizens should not be afraid of asking them for help. While many great officers are this way, there is much room for improvement which is obvious as people feel the need to learn to talk to the police just to cover their own asses. So while no, police who focus on the arrest aren't retards, I do wish "to protect and serve" stood for more officers.	27
0	Id hit it. Fuck whatever.	27
0	Dumb fucking sheboon. shocker	27
0	They protect and serve the state, not individuals.	27
0	Youre just lashing out without having any idea why youre angry or at what. I hope you find direction in your life	27
0	Just had to clean the coffee I spat on the screen to write this.   This is why I love Reddit	27
0	I love how the comments try to justify her by saying whatever noise the child was making was fine because it was laughter, when the OP herself stated he doesn't laugh normal.  My laughter is exactly the same terrifying sound and eardrum-bursting volume as an adult howler monkey, but don't you dare judge me while I'm rattling your fillings our of your head for 2 hours. It's laughter, and all laughter, regardless of how shrill or loud, is a gift from the angels. Sir.	27
0	that starbucks goer snot nose white knight...iam done with this..we deserve to be invaded by islam, russians or the chinese	27
0	Oh fuck off with your attempted gender war. she was part of the group and they didnt just stop once. 2 things to consider here:   1. what about the people behind HIM? They could smash him just as hard if they caught up.   2. did you SEE how fast she stopped?!?!?! who the fuck has those reaction times?!?!	27
0	So is this brigading now?	27
0	this is not PPD video. she hit his bag, he hit her face. not the same thing.	27
0	I have not lost the game. This is mostly due to a refusal to remember what we're talking about, but I am remembering that last time this happened this is what I was suppose to do.	27
0	...that tired ass saying again.	27
0	Have you never heard of the first amendment?	27
0	She's half white half turkish, which is basically white. Get your racism right faggot.	27
0	Im surprised she touched the student, they get fired if they get involved to a point.   She probably sent/called for the resource officer to handle it.	27
0	Nah I'd rather fuck her with something that actually exists.  [Disclaimer: Yeah white people, at least in this part of the world, probably do have certain privileges. I just couldn't resist making the joke though]	27
0	She must have 2 mothers.	27
0	But at the same time you're limiting the ability for them to express themselves through their own attire. Limiting freedom of expression only results in more radical expression. On another note though, people will find anything and everything to make fun of you for in school. It's just an unfortunate hierarchy of growing up.	27
0	Thats a fair point. I read this story right as it came out, not recently. However, I still think it is ridiculous to prosecute someone in a democracy for a political/social stance that was obviously hyperbolic. No matter how stupid that statement is. I agree she should be fired though.	27
0	The pussy pass with always remain to a certain extent because women are simply more valuable to a society survival. It kinda sucks but it's nature man.  1 man and 100 woman could repopulate a society a lot faster than 1 woman and 100 men could.	27
0	Not the point. The point is that she didn't try to use her pussy pass. She's just a belligerent idiot. And the guy is an idiot too if he knew how shallow that canal is. Imagine she landed on her head and broke her neck?	27
0	I support this cause 110%. ☺	27
0	I'm not advocating for women to have the right to go to school in nothing but a sports bra and short jeans. A dress code is necessary in schools, but I don't believe in stripping a part of a child's identity away from them by requiring them to wear uniforms. People don't have to be raised wearing uniforms in school to be able to wear proper attire in the work place.	27
0	&gt; Imagine she landed on her head and broke her neck?   Then it would be her own damn fault for starting a fight. When someone is grabbing onto you and swinging full force like that (seriously, her punches looked genuinely dangerous) you defend yourself any way you can. It's not the victim's responsibility to consider the safety of the *person who is violently attacking them.*  Plus, if you lose a fight and everyone around you starts applauding, maybe you deserved what you got.	27
0	TBH I don't see what the big deal is here, let people wear whatever they want, they want to walk around wearing a bra, let them, why the hell is it a big deal?. Now I don't believe in that equality bs, but why is her wearing a sports bra an issue?.	27
0	"The most reposted dumbshit garbage for the stupidest of people to enjoy."	27
0	Bullshit. Teachers can totally break up fights with there hands. Have seen it in person and in videos.	27
0	..you are a moron...	27
0	Why are you so offended?	27
0	eh. yes. i mean. pretty much. i dont really care though. most of the vids are just a woman getting the bad end of some scenario with a veeeeeery faint pp attempt or not one at all. but the mods are very open about their laziness. i agree its a bit shit but it doesnt bother me.	27
0	Wait, he can't copy and paste the text from another link, but you can?	27
0	What text did I copy?	27
0	&gt;Judge orders woman to walk 30 miles, the length of trip, for bailing on cab fare  Someone else posted the link in another sub, you feel like you can copy and paste, fine.  But don't freak out when others do the same thing.	27
0	That's the title of the article. Looks like you didn't even bother following the link.	27
0	I did, what I am saying is that you copied a post that someone else made.  Just like he did.  You freaked out about him doing it, but apparently it's okay for you to do it.	27
0	And referring to a book by its title makes one a plagiarist too.	27
0	Sure, doubt they will though, just because they can wear whatever they want doesn't mean that there won't be repercussions for wearing those things. If you dress in something that seems really absurd then there's a social backlash within the school and people will make fun of you. I don't see why them wearing something is supposed to bother me, unless they are representing me in some way.	27
0	Although I don't necessarily agree with you, I thought she was in college and not high school.	27
0	Complaining about reposting a link? Lol, it's like a little kid screaming "You can't repost a link! It's MINE, I saw it FIRST!"	27
0	Appropriate, no. Should they be allowed to wear it, sure, if they wanted to wear a superhero costume I wouldn't be against that either. Let their parents and them decide how they want to dress.	27
0	Her problem is her cunt has not seen a dick like ever.	27
0	When I read the headline I instantly thought of the Middle-East. I didn't know mediaeval stuff like this was legal in America. Seems extremely weird. Aren't there laws about it? Normally a crime has a legal range of possible judgements attached to it, no? Either in money fined or time spent in jail. How can a judge do this?	27
0	Then fuck off out of the sub you whinging cunt. You have done fuck all to get us mods focus. I do not remember your name from anything like a message to mods.  As for this video I think the crowds reaction says it all. If you enact violence expect the same to be given regardless of gender. Just because the person who ended up in the canal was female means nothing.	27
0	&gt;So you're saying that if she had broken her neck from being thrown off into a shallow canal for being belligerent she would've deserved it  Yeah fucking right she would have. Your moral compass seems to be driven by the person was female and she lost the fight she started. You are either a dumb fuck feminist or beta white knight.	27
0	I am kinda for this movement. I think we should support and go for no top Tuesdays for all women.  But ban the video maker as she is ugly as fuck. No one wants to see her tits.	27
0	Doesn't that fall under the unusual part of cruel &amp; unusual punishment?	27
0	Do you not see the difference or are you autistic?  Nobody assumed OP created the link. We don't think he's a journalist. He doesn't receive credit for the article.  The comment, we assumed was written by the user. We mentally gave him credit for the work even though he stole it.  No difference there? None at all?	27
0	Hahahaha real mature. What a shithead.	27
0	So which are you? Cunt or white knight.	27
0	&gt; You on the other hand seem to just plain hate women  If the person who got chucked in the canal was a belligerent male you and I would not being having this discourse.    &gt;You hate women specifically  I quite love women. But because I called your ass out you say such things is terrible.  &gt;I've defended this sub before, but no more  You have defended it to nobody you stupid fuck. The unsubscribe button is just -------&gt; Click it fast	27
0	&gt;Safe to say you're neither class president nor valedictorian Ditto  Just do not pretend you have in any way shape or form you had anything to do with this sub other than being a subscriber. You have not interacted with any mods here and we have our focus quite clear.  /r/quityourbullshit	27
0	&gt; No, my moral compass is driven by the fact that a person doesn't deserve to get crippled for life or killed just because they were belligerent.  What if that belligerent person chucked a cop just doing his/her job into the canal and he/she was crippled for life? I as a person have a right to be safe. If you as a person threaten me and I defend myself from you and you get hurt then problem is yours, not mine.  But you are stuck on it was a girl.  Go on. You have more to say?	27
0	The way you express yourself when talking about clothing doesn't have to refer to how expensive your clothes are. There's all different kinds of unique styles of clothing, ranging at all different prices. I was raised in a very poor household with my dad not working and my mom working at K-mart. I may not have had brand name clothes but I could still express my individuality through the patterns, writings, or general style of the clothes I wore.	27
0	&gt;person who got dangerously chucked  Forget PPD and this sub. Lets get to violence. What is the level of protection you are allowed when someone attacks you?	27
0	Man...like 90% of the crap submissions here have nothing to do with the subject at hand. This is not /r/misogyny. Women do not have primate based pussypasses. You are dumb as fuck.	27
0	op confirmed dumb as fuck	27
0	Not sure she used her gender to justify anything here, but great find nonetheless.	27
0	Where the denied part? This is fucking stupid  yall just watching to hate and it's not relevant to the sub.	27
1	Look at that poor guy, he is scare and confuse.  While the rapist are showing her junk telling he to obey her.	28
1	If there was no camera he would be charged with rape and his life would be over	28
1	Women are women.  Political divisions have no impact on base female nature.	28
1	Most importantly not paying helps filter out low quality women looking for a provider.	28
1	Yeah, tell me again how women are not prostitutes.  Actually, lower than such.  Imagine being wealthy but going to a food bank.  Strong and independent my dick.	28
1	Not so sure about that. Muslim men are basically groomed to be simps. they believe paradise is at the feet of the mother, and mother is 4 times more important then fathers plus how women are jewels that need to be protected and hidden from view. Dont let muslim women feeling oppressed fool you, they are taking full advantage of the situation	28
1	Never go to online dating, like match, tinder, okcupid. There are bad news for men. Women on there are all feminist on steroids.	28
1	In my time I've dated women from all 5 continents and, whilst there *do* exist *degrees* of cuntiness, basically....... **AWALT** and *they only get worse the longer you stay with them* so do not, for fucksake, believe their initial 'best behaviour'... AWALT. AWALT. AWALT. It's a shame but true nonetheless.	28
1	It's sad we need cameras to prove innocents, women are trusted with anything they say though videos coming out are showing we should do the contrary. What ever happened to innocent until proven guilty anyway?	28
1	Are you kidding me? Australian women are known worldwide as some of the worst.   Funny thing about that map is that the most mgtow searches are coming from British Commonwealth countries. All those particular nations are known to have the most disgusting women on the planet.	28
1	Don't pay for dates, any date, ever. If you're paying to take a girl out, its generally for one reason, to get laid.   You're better off either getting a prostitute and actually guaranteed getting your moneys worth, or go to a bar, get drunk and find a girl to take home for the night, never buy drinks for a girl at a bar either.	28
1	Oh seriously! I used to think UK women were so charming until I discovered some of the porn they have coming out of there. If you've ever heard of dogging you'd never give a UK woman a second glance.	28
1	"Very unusual case"  The only unusual case is how she beat herself up and got caught. Other than that, pretty normal.	28
1	&gt; The Cossettes married in 1979, when he was 20 and she was 21. They separated after 22 years of marriage and in a 2006 court settlement, he agreed to pay $1,000 a month in alimony for an indefinite period.  Women.  The more you give them, the more you are legally *required* to give them.  Should have pumped and dumped her decades ago, and had just *one* child with a surrogate.  He'd be off climbing mountains right now.  Never live under the same roof with a woman!  Source:  retired in my forties.  No kids, no wife.  Life is easy.   :)	28
1	"Parties cannot sidestep support obligations by unilaterally deciding to leave the workforce"  sure is a funny way of saying you believe in slavery.	28
1	This is my first post to this subreddit. I am aware that MGTOW is more of a lifestyle than "an organization." Still though, seeing this was a pleasant surprise.	28
1	I discovered the manosphere a couple years ago. I'm not a MGTOW but I have a lot of respect for you guys.	28
1	I live in Toronto. Stop by sometime and all your questions will be answered. Totally vapid, personality-less, boring, entitled, ugly, socially inept, unsexy, masculine lowlives. And the men here are total manginas.	28
1	Maybe we should get organised and design some stickers we can put up everywhere?	28
1	So, you're mourning the loss of what exactly?  You want a girlfriend?  Why?  What can she possibly offer you?  Let the bitches alone, their hypergamy will keep them unhappy, childless and remove them from the gene pool.  MG motherfucking TOW!	28
1	I needed that today lol.	28
1	It's true bro.  Look 100% of the bitches are chasing the top 10% of guys. So most women will never get what they want. And now that even the beta boys are waking up, their providers are walking away. So they won't even have any beta bucks. You want poetic justice, wait 25 years from now when retirement home property skyrockets. Invest now and make money off these same bitches. LOL. They get to be unhappy for life and we get to make money off it!  Now ain't that better than a few measly scraps of used pussy?  I thought so.  MG to the fucking TOW!	28
1	They think its fight club.	28
1	They obviously forgot the first rule.	28
1	From what I've read it's Canada, Australia, the US and the UK that are the worst, presumably because of the growth of feminism combined with a popular culture which encourages vapid materialism and zero responsibility for women.  Feminism is huge in Scandinavia as well but their culture values more than just the Kardashians, so while it's bad, it's not quite as bad as the four nations I mentioned specifically.	28
1	The answer is simple:   1) Go deeper into MGTOW. If you're still looking on OkCupid you haven't found your internal value.    2) Take a nice trip to a prostitute. You're doing the exact same thing you would be on OkCupid except you will get something for your efforts and money, you will be 100% less frustrated, and you wont waste an absurd amount of time listening to the most boring stories known to man (if you've been on a first date with a modern woman you know what I'm talking about).	28
1	Life is so much sweeter when the delusion that females are human dies.  Welcome to freedom my brother!	28
1	A PUA thinks he's red-pill, but the truth often is that he's so blue you think you're looking at a Smurf. It has to be that way, the only way PUA can work is to try to give the woman what you think she wants so she'll give you a good time in bed tonight.	28
1	You read right. They don't have the virtues that separate man from beast (empathy, honour, love, integrity, sacrifice, respect, respect for personal freedom, etc). They still think on a caveman level.  No matter how privileged or fucked up a man is they'd never do some of the disgusting things women do. I've never heard of a man killing his kids for attention. Women dominate child abuse and child murder. I judge humans by how they treat the most vulnerable.	28
1	They are children. The sooner men start thinking of them that way the happier they'll be.	28
1	Errrr---ahhhhhhh---- I have to respectfully disagree. A dog seems to get the "pecking order" fairly quickly, and once he/she learns it-- which doesn't take long-- you have a faithful friend for the life of the animal. Women seem to be far more mercurial, even the best of them aren't fully to be trusted from what I gather.	28
1	I unsubbed from Red Pill. Too much PUA desperation in there.	28
1	Stay strong, Brother. We are here. We are listening.	28
1	Girls today have unrealistic expectations...	28
1	Disagree about red pill because it's ultimately gynocentric: all about appealing to women at all costs. You can accept red pill facts without engaging in red pill behaviours.	28
1	I've done the same.  The only thing sadder than a slave is a slave that not only thinks he's free but that he's the master.	28
1	Q - What do we really want from women?  A - Sex.	28
1	&gt; The only thing sadder than a slave is a slave that not only thinks he's free but that he's the master.  Or as I heard it said by someone recently *"the beggar who foolishly thinks he's the chooser".*	28
1	same here, bro. been in few LTRs in my 20-30s life and every single time I was the one who was losing something at the end. Girl just changed me for newer version. They don't want to 'work' on relationships, just saying like that. It's a common hook. They don't need to, because then they would need to work on *themselves*. Why do that if they can easy get someone else who don't yet know about their flaws and repeat the whole pattern? ;)  Relationships *are* limiting.	28
1	If you are in a public place and get attacked by a woman you should just run. Seriously. There is no way that you get out of there in one piece if you try to defend yourself. You are on your own.  If she follows you alone you can fuck her up in a quiet side street and go on with your business. If white-knights chase you then you should run a couple of blocks around a corner and ask some people for help. They don't know that a female is involved and will most likely try helping you.	28
1	Because teenagers are brainwashed by their own brains into thinking it's the goal of life itself. That's a problem I guess. And I say that as a teen myself.	28
1	Precisely. If prostitution were to become legal across the country all of the "societal power" women enjoy ....their entire "system" would evaporate overnight.	28
1	***If it Flies, Floats or Fucks, it's cheaper to rent.***  Is it "cheating" to rent a boat instead of buying one?  You know there is the other old saying that there are two REALLY happy days in the life of any boat *owner*, the day he BUYS his boat... and the day he SELLS the damned thing.	28
1	He's screwed... pretty much at HER whim (or the governments' if she goes on "assistance").	28
1	Never understood why anyone would ever pay money for a "cam" whore.	28
1	Or act now men and stay single and not have to do any of that...!!!! And you will have more than enough scratch to pay for play!!!	28
1	Despite the fact that the Guardian is a feminist rag, most of the comments thanfully deride the author	28
1	Your rights end where MY feels begin!   I wanna have a baby NOW!!!	28
1	And don't forget, we're supposed to pick up on her subtle cues and read her mind as to which of those bullet-pointed demands she wants from us.   That fact alone keeps me single.	28
1	look up assault cases where a man is assaulted by a woman and how the judge rules in those cases.  your option wont work	28
1	So we can say the incidences of rape is 7 times greater in a country where prostitution is illegal.   Nuff said. Legalize prostitution. Any female against this is supporting rape.	28
1	I thought that guy was intelligent at first and thus knew those embryos should never see the light of day, but if you read till the end, the idiot gave up his principles for $400.  He chose a short term gain of **FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS** over his financial freedom in the long run.    Shes making such a big deal about how she was victorious and will never need to see that scumbag again, but as soon as the children are born she will be back at his doorstep and demand child support.  This time the courts will be on **HER** side.  What a fucking idiot.	28
1	The problem is that women view men like we view a video game.  According to their logic, we are there to make their lives better.  When we fail in this purpose we are disposable.  It comes back to the socialization of women, we are portrayed as a life accessory, not a life partner.	28
1	Whatever it is they can't have it.	28
1	Forget about that list, women are like teenagers. They are driven by hormones and absolute clueless when it comes to knowing what they really desire.	28
1	I find it rather entertaining and scary at the same time how the power of the pussy is able to manipulate hard working men into giving women money. Cool list btw haha...fuck that shit.	28
1	Sadly you are wrong :/   I don't have the links to the cases but i know there are multiple where males that donated sperm to sperm banks anonymously were ordered to pay child support after the parent found out the name.   Idea is that you can't sign away someone elses rights. Pretty super retarded that a women can decide to have a baby and then decide she wants support.	28
1	As i've posted before, the Youtube channel, Feminism LOL, is run by a woman. Of course she's fairly intelligent and doesn't want feminism to go too far and lose ground, but she states in one of her videos that to find the attention whores in any male dominated group; you look for the women that do not add anything to the subject and only repeat information that has already been stated by others. Women can add to male spheres, and the woman that runs Feminism LOL, has quite a bit of good, thought provoking videos. You just have to notice when you're watching an attention whore.	28
1	Camwhores really think sitting on cam and rubbing their genitals is hard work?	28
1	Women have been infiltrating MGTOW for a while. There was a woman who said she wanted to make a video on mens issues, and requested that men send their own footage to her. Basically she wanted men to create her project for her instead of going out and meeting and filming men. Pathetic. I bet a bunch of weak ass MGTOW helped her too.   Men, even MGTOW, underestimate how designed they are by evolution to aid and sacrifice for women. We have to stay vigilant and question the situation whenever a woman asks for our help. Feminists want women to be independent and I agree. Let them earn their own way.	28
1	&gt; aka she can't go to court to get child support.  Yes, she can.  See "child support" isn't viewed as HER right, but rather as the right of the "child", ergo in the courts eyes she had no standing to sign that away, especially not before the child was born.  Is that a fustercluck of insane pseudo-logic? Why yes, yes it is... welcome to the legal system.	28
1	Man you know what women want most of all? *More.*	28
1	Has nothing to do with justice. It is women crying wolf too many times (rape) and women choosing abusive partners and staying with such in spite of the abuse. Women fantasize about rape and love abusive men. That is gospel truth. There are enough people, politicians and tax dollars available to care about women.   Now I think you need to water your horse, white knight motherfucker.	28
1	Fuck off white Knight. It doesn't matter what moved her to say this shit. These words were already inside her. Mangina cocksucker.	28
1	Canada is out. They made prostitution illegal (for men only) this year. It is legal to sell sex but illegal to purchase it. Remember Canada is a feminist shit hole.	28
1	I hope you are being sarcastic.   Prostitutes are people.   It's the "develop" part that really bothers me, though. You can't possibly be on a MGTOW subreddit without understanding that this very process of "developing" relationships with women IS the problem.  You can also stop acting like the entire thing is as simple as "just go socialize."	28
1	Women in general hate gays. Women hate any man who doesn't want them. Sure they appear to like them on the surface but they use gay men worse than they use beta males and laugh at them behind their backs. Glad to see some gay brothers joining up with mgtow. It was, after all, a gay man who had the BALLS to write and publish the Sexodus articles in the mainstream. Those articles are the catalyst of this movement and were hands down the most popular articles on Breitbart.	28
1	That is great to hear, thank you.   I have many stories to tell.  Will be posting them up over the coming months.	28
1	I would recommend trying mindful meditation. It takes a while to get the hang of but by being more mindful you will be able to catch these sexual desires as they arise in your head and let them go away before you end up acting on them.  I like to think of women as the worlds greatest distraction. They have such beautiful bodies designed to steal your focus and make you desire them. When you realise that its all in an effort to manipulate your thoughts and feelings to make you want to procreate with them you'll be able to rise above your most primal urges. Be strong brother.	28
1	I wont help either of them. Ill just do my own thing. Go.....my own way.	28
1	I'm with oldredder here.    What do women want? Who cares!	28
1	Lol.   In case you didn't notice, she's was a US pilot.   Still, since we're what protects Canada, you're right that incompetent women in the US military are a threat to you.   As for the Muslims ... your immigration policy is on you.	28
1	True. Another thing is learn to ignore them in their presence when they whore it up. It drives them INSANE. I've been doing this for years and its hilarious. And the best part is it makes them dance even more for that sweet sweeeeet attention. Remember, you are the prize. Make the woman dance.	28
1	Here's a key point in the article: "the women are going to graduate regardless of how they performed"	28
1	I thought that too. Ahhh what might have been! No sooner did she have my last name than she managed to get fired from her job-- she blamed her supervisor but 20/20 hindsight tells me she was more likely fired for gross insubordination. She never even tried to look for another job, and as far as I know was still unemployed the day the divorce became final.  Good luck, you're gonna need it.	28
1	Tell me again how women are not inherently parasitic.   Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand go!	28
1	You may have been asleep but with women, what's hers is hers, what's yours is hers, and what's between the two of you is hers. And the courts back this. Think about this the next time you rationalize excuses for dealing with women.	28
1	It's a shame, her death could have easily been avoided. Affirmative action can have fatal consequences in the military.	28
1	How many of those benefits could be enjoyed by just having a roommate to split your bills with?	28
1	He did have a particularly repellent wife in Winnie. But your point stands.	28
1	He was just worried she’d get him one of her famous neckties for his birthday.	28
1	There's nobody to like in this story. A pox on all their houses.	28
1	Don't worry. It's probably just because of education.	28
1	My uncle was successful and well-to-do before he met his ex-wife.  She took the house, his car, and half his money when they divorced (idk how long it was in the marriage).  His alimony payments were more than he made every month.  He's now an alcoholic living in a tent in the Australian bushland.	28
1	Nothing wrong with being friends with women, as long as they aren't using you.	28
1	I am the lone single dude in the middle of a sea of cohabiting and married couples and in all honesty I:   -am in the best shape -by far the least stressed/most relaxed -happiest -get to spend the most time doing the things I love  They are always stressed out, stuck doing one thing after another that they would rather not be doing, eating bad foods, bitching about their partners or not wanting to go home, and saying "I wish" when they see/hear about the stuff I get to do.   No thanks.	28
1	If these laws applied to women then every single one of them should be locked up. Everything about women and their nature is a lie. Women are personified lies. Everything from their makeup to their style of dress.	28
1	In my biology lecture yesterday, where there is roughly 100 students, the professor said something he thought was funny...  We're doing arthropods, and a student asks why female spiders are much larger than males. He says some bits about protecting young and carrying eggs... etc etc... and and then he says:           **"The males are really only used for their sperm".**                After he said that 1/4 of the class seemed to cheer quietly, as if our society should replicate the spider kingdom... Sigh.	28
1	She's married, and she said it makes guys buy her free drinks?    Women provide sex; taking it forcibly or under false pretenses is rape.   Men provision; so isn't taking that forcibly or under false pretenses rape?	28
1	Seriously, she shoves socks in her bra to make her tits bigger? Us guys joke about shoving a sock in our drawers, but chicks actually do this shit.	28
1	( . )( . )  --&gt;  (  . Y .  )   . . .   Don't want. Maybe it would work even better if you wrote "cheap bitch" on your forehead.	28
1	WTF? So, answer this...  She gets naked with a guy, and then she knows he instantly sees the obvious deception.    How in the holy hell can she look herself in the mirror and not be disgusted with her ingenuine, deceptive self, let alone not realize she'll never, ever be taken seriously due to her obvious lack of self-esteem?  Oh wait, she's a woman...she doesn't care.	28
1	&gt;Men provision; so isn't taking that forcibly or under false pretenses rape?  Of course not! But, you can bet your ass, if women start paying for dinner on dates and they want sex and he doesn't "provide" it, they'll try to enact a law wherein they can sue for damages.	28
1	Fake hair, fake lips, fake eyes, fake nails, fake boobs....FAKE!	28
1	Fake charm, fake enthusiasm, fake sincerity, fake concern, fake...	28

1	Implying women are capable of self reflection.	28
1	What. The. Actual. Fuck.  As an aside. Yeah, I'm pretty sure women could get hit with that Much more frequently than men.  But I'd take bets on who's gonna use it more.	28
1	I always enjoy telling women "you all start your day off with a lie". They get all huffy and puffy and as soon as I say "you put makeup on in the morning" ........ Silence	28
1	I love how panicked feminists are getting over losing their biggest bargaining chip.	28
1	Well duh. Rich ugly guy will be her BB and she will fuck some unemployed hot AF on the side. Then make the BB pay for it LOL.	28
1	&gt; the separation of childbirth from a woman’s body will also give the anti-feminist Right terrifying new points of leverage at a crucial moment in feminist history.  oh you mean this chip? squirm ye feminists!	28
1	Well she's certainly not gonna be choking on any cock any time soon.	28
1	Is she really one to be complaining about being surrounded by stink?  I'm sure everyone she's ever known in life feels the same.	28
1	Well she says she helped him $, and then he would later return the favor. So sounds kinda even?    They way she worded it doesn't make it sound like he owes her.   Also there's no way he's made very much progress financially since he's only been working two months out of college.   Ultimately, they're both kind of young and probably clueless	28
1	In order to defeat the patriarchy we must make ourselves repulsive to its members!	28
1	They do that, y'know. But, there's a reason she's your ex.  Mine tried something similar about 6 months back. Trying to stir up old feelings of love and so on. But, that was outweighed by the last months of that marriage. Nobody should have to hear words like that spoken to him, about him by the one who supposedly loved you. Even apart from the physical violence (I got the broken nose and the bloody tee-shirt). So--- nope. There's a reason why she's ex- and it'll stay that way.	28
1	Yeah, it's like she forgot about leaving me for the other guy... I guess her new Prince Charming isn't working out. Not my problem, we had our time together but that time is past.	28
1	There y'go. If she did come back what would you have? A woman you don't dare trust again. She'd leave you for another, sure as the sun rises in the morning.	28
1	I don't get it. Several of women's "hardships" are fully optional, like giving birth and wearing high heels! No one makes them do these things except for themselves.	28
1	She's trying to PLATE you!  haha.  She may have also found herself recently impregnated by some low-life and is hoping to rope you back in, sit in your dick, then claim that its your baby.  **avoid at all costs**	28
1	Let this serve you to gauge how much of a MGTOW you are. The quicker you reject her the stronger you are. Purge what's left of the blue pill sludge in your system for good.	28
1	Well it took about three hours and two text messages for me to reject her this time. Still too long!	28
1	Lol.   The MGTOW Olympics. 😁	28
1	Im tired of that word patriarchy. I say if a woman thinks she wants to work county maintenance with the boys she is welcome to pick up my garbage on Tuesday. Does she want to build her country? Then break out the tool belt or the welding whip and get to work... but we all know they dont want any part of that. They dont want anything to do with something that will make them sweat or stink or just filthy in general... lol what they really want is a nice managerial position as your boss. Whats equal about that?	28
1	Trust, I asked my sister and some female friends why they wear high heels and shoes that hurt them if they hated wearing them so much.  They all laughed like it was obvious and just replied, "One, it makes pronounces our calves and makes our butts look tighter. Secondly, it's also to make other women jealous. It's totally worth looking good for a little pain."  Children.	28
1	At this point I just want them to go away. With that in mind, i'm laughing about the artificial womb I saw posted. Keep it up cunts.	28
1	Feminism must be seen as a defensive position for some women that explains why they dont have relationships and validates them rather than dealing with the fact that they have let themselves become unattractive to the opposite sex. Not that all feminist are in this condition physically but Id say it fits those that fit the description.	28
1	Ironically, she has no problem stuffing her mouth with food that is provided for her by Male farmers, and transported to her local grocery market by Male truck drivers. Patriarchy is just a purposeful mis-characterization of female privilege in the west.	28
1	What a load of bullshit. Clearly written by a girl. Of course they don't want to reveal the truth about abs. They love abs. My plate told me she didn't like sculpted abs, then 3 days later tells me she likes it on me. HAHAHA	28
1	Feminist are easy to spot. They all have vacant crazy eyes.  They "lost it".	28
1	Thus Rome fell not to its hordes of barbarians or its incompetent Emperors, but to its women.	28
1	More proof that women are just like children.  They never know what they want.	28
1	&gt;We know what we are getting into when he's got the same exact body type at the age of 22 that he's going to have at 45.  Yeah, funny how that *doesn't'* work with women's bodies over the same timeframe....   And oh my flying spaghetti monster, the sheer, distilled *entitlement* felt, to a deeeep level, on the part of a scarily huge majority of women...it's *other-worldly*!	28
1	Actually I think in her case what she is "surrounded by" is *cellulite,* and as others have noted, that (and the fungal growths in the various cracks and folds) is probably the source of the "stench" that she smells.	28
1	This might be just another shit test to seperate beta males (providers, getting free drinks) from alpha males (actually the guys who make their 'ginas tingle), respectively to make it easier for women to distinguish between both types. Fuck social engineering.   I don't think I have to even mention this but stay in shape guys if you enjoy working out.	28
1	"Plus sized" women like the dad bod. Gay.  Dad bod also says, "Beta male right here! Let me know when you're done with the cock carousel."  Yeah, do whatever you want is my advice.	28
1	Fuck off, sluts.	28
1	&gt; This might be just another shit test  Damn, I think you're right! lol	28
1	'It wasn’t always this way. In the 1800s, men typically got custody of the children in the event of a split — not as a result of privilege, but because they were solely financially responsible for them. They got the children, but they also got the bill. Benefits Britain didn’t exist, encouraging single mums to go it alone. Now, 200 years on, women get the children, but men still get the bill. Sometimes, men even pay for children who aren’t theirs.'  This.	28
1	"Chad Thundercock won't marry me!"  "Oh, those other weirdo creeps want to though? Eww! I'm a STRONG INDEPENDENT WOMAN!"	28
1	I thought they don't need no man!   Women are so fucking stupid. It's a wonder they're able to breathe without easy to read, Lego style instructions. 😆	28
1	Enjoy your feminist equality bitch!	28
1	I like how she got all upset,  like the man was supposed to give that box to her or something.	28
1	20: I'm strong and independent,  I don't need  no man. Get out of my face creep.   27: I'm strong and independent, but I feel kinda lonely. Why won't Chad Thunderbolt call me back?   33: Where did all the good men go :'( Sorry I called you a creep all those years ago,  will you please accept my loose,  dry pussy as an apology?	28
1	Feminism is one giant shit test. Anything a woman tells men (through the media, etc) about what they like is basically a shit test	28
1	Hahaha, Why Does the internet hate women? I wonder.	28
1	LOL the white knights are in full force this year. Why? Because so many men are ignoring women. And of course women love it and chase after us to try and lure us back. Which means dickless, blue pill invertebrates have to put in overtime for their affections. LOL.   Let's keep the manginas workin'!   I love being a misogynist!   I hateeeeee alllll womennnnnnnnnn! 😀😀😀😀😀	28
1	lol the internet is hard on WOMEN? you've got to be joking, the internet is hard on EVERYONE.  Women are not immune to anonymous critics saying mean things on the internet, men shrug that shit off, as should everyone.	28
1	Women don't like being treated equally under the label "anonymous" and want their girl bonus points back?   [There are no girls on the Internet](http://i.imgur.com/NArL0KHh.jpg)	28
1	They've never been treated equally until they've taken on someone online in an anonymous forum where their looks don't give them a bonus to conversation	28
1	So, according to this mangina, anything anyone says that he disagrees with is "bad".  Fuck you, bud.	28
1	I like the cut of his jib.	28
1	White Knights are the blight of humanity.	28
1	The only person talking sense there is that old woman.  She said to one of the white knights - "Why don't you pay her taxi fare then?"	28
1	&gt; Men need marriage like a fish needs a bicycle  Ah yes, that old feminist quote recast. I always thought the corollary to "women need men like a fish needs a bicycle" is "men need women like a bicycle needs a fish". I checked my bicycle, no fish needed.	28
1	Plus notice whatever they have to contribute is 80% emotion, 10% boasting, and 10% shaming.	28
1	He's one of the biggest blue pillers I've seen since Terry Crews and that mangina rulebook he wrote a while back. Seriously, the female CEO of Reddit tried suing for gender discrimination since she didn't get something she bellowed and he wants to go on record recommending her as chairman for life? GFTO.	28
1	It's the only place where women don't get treated like special snowflakes without nazi-like mods (SRS, offmychest, etc)	28
1	Vice.com is a SJW circle jerk.  They got that domain name to fool people into thinking they are so edgy and bad-ass.  But they really just latch on to whatever is the hot "cause célèbre" of the week.  Too bad a porn company didn't grab the domain name first.	28
1	manginas and white knights will eventually die as women realise they can't get what they want through them. they never respect manginas, remember that. they need us. and we can show them our middle finger ;P	28
1	**Feminist:** Kill all men!  **MRA:** now is that really appropriate?  **Feminist:** Stop policing my language, you misogynist!  **White Knights:** Misogynist?  **Feminist:** MISOGYNIST!!!	28
1	wow, men advocating for the right to be allowed in their own family or not get pieces of their dick cut off w/o consent is being equated with stuff like "gasthekikes"?  Also no mention of feminists who are calling for genocide.  I wonder if that will still be allowed in these so called safe spaces.	28
1	She was gonna do that anyway--- who is she trying to kid? The lack of flowers is just an excuse--- sorry, not buying it. Now then--- let me try something like that as an excuse for cheating-- she forgets to give me something for Father's Day so I go find some stray. Uh huh--- you just KNOW what's gonna happen next, don't you? No way in Hades I'd ever get away with that.	28
1	Women think on a very low plane akin to that of cattle. So when they see this excuse they will immediately disregard her infidelity and place blame squarely the man. Women will deflect guilt for anything up to and including 1st degree murder. It is a survival mechanism from their primitive minds. If women are perceived as anything but babies then they will have to fend for themselves.	28
1	This will be happening worldwide as men continue to go their own way. You better be prepared to either die or kill them. They will stick you with child support with this and you better believe the judges will grant it. A woman just got off scott free for breaking into a man's house and sexually assaulting him. You better be mentally prepared to kill a woman if you have to in the near future. MGTOW will literally drive them insane.	28
1	Men all around the world have to understand that the female aversion to guilt is a crucial part of their biology and an ugly reality. It's a defensive reaction invented by nature to let a woman override presented (potentially dangerous) logical facts by her feelings, usually to keep her emotional life stable and thus increasing the likelihood to provide offspring for the human race.   Once you've realised this the only logical conclusion is:  **You can't actually trust any woman at all.**	28
1	Esther Vilar is a very wise woman and smelled this whole social engineering bullshit decades before it even reached its full dimension. I sincerly respect her. I've watched that "debate" between Alice Schwarzer (a german second-wave feminist) and Esther Villar where she spoke out against feminism. She wasn't afraid to kick that feminist hornet nest back in the 70's.	28
1	reading that article made me want to vomit.	28
1	Yeah this article is just confirming what I am finding to be true of women. They cannot be trusted and men who enter relationships with them are asking to get burned. I am 29 and am done with women, maybe some one night stands if I get bored of beating off, but I see no reason to have women in my life	28
1	Ha, that's what you get for marrying bro. Women are likely to cheat anyways, so why bother comitting? Hit it and quit it, she can go bang other guys and you can forget about her and continue going on your way.	28
1	If anything this shows that women are not inherently fucked, its just that nowadays most have been raised this way and even the ones that are aware of their behavior continue to behave the way they do willingly. I am honestly surprised this was written by a woman. It's actually nice to see, reminds me that there is always hope for people to act the right way.	28
1	I reject personal relationships with women and keep my civil interactions with them public and at a minimum. I only will deal with them on a workplace setting. It works out great considering the fact women don't really matter in a man's life. What could I possibly be missing? Lol	28
1	Yup. School is an indoctrination centre. You were just manifesting the indoctrination back then. Thankfully you know better now and have broken the brainwashing.	28
1	I am celibate. I am so disgusted by female nature that they do not arouse me enough to pursue sex with them. Not saying it is a bad thing for mgtow to pursue sex. This is just my personal situation.	28
1	They are better at it and also allowed to get away with it all their lives	28
1	I've never actively talked to people of the opposite gender. Girls used to talk to me first in high school but nothing came out of it because of other issues I have.  I just don't want to make the effort. Too much work and and not enough return. It took some time to accept that there is no Mrs. AugmentedFury out there, my ideal woman doesn't exist. With that said it's been fine. I have to worry about other things besides women.	28
1	My problem is I love pussy. Thankfully pussy don't love me all that much LOL.	28
1	Funny thing about that is that one reason men go to Brazil-- specifically Rio-- is that the women there have a rather loose reputation. About the other thing--- seems like a lot of us have had the "pleasure" of having to deal with a violent, crazy woman. They hide it so well until they've got you hooked--- then all hell breaks loose as soon as she thinks her victim is trapped.	28
1	The second I saw the word "whiny" I discarded the article. Shaming language and "man up" sentiments have no place in the MGTOW community .	28
1	they're all so proud of their whoredom	28
1	No one gives them any reason *not* to be anymore.	28
1	She wants that Christian Grey fellow from that BDSM rag and movie.	28
1	My mom in a nutshell.	28
1	Get a vasectomy early and single. Woman aren't happy about it, but that's their problem, not yours.	28
1	I actually respect her.  She told it to him straight.  No "its not you, its me", no "I need some space" (which is what an ex-gf of mine told me) not "I think we should see other people".  She gave it to him un-sugar coated: "you won't make enough money to keep me happy."  I'd rather get that answer, its at least honest.	28
1	Mine too. She had 3 kids and got child support for each of us. After I was 18 and not living in her house (I actually never lived with her, and she never supported me) or being supported by her at all, I never saw a DIME of that money that was supposed to be for me going to school.   Then my brother moved out and she kept child support going for him and made him go to classes for a few weeks to make it look like he was in school so she would keep getting child support money.	28
1	This. I respect prostitutes and escorts more than the average woman.	28
1	Unless you have whack job parents that would "honour" kill you then tell them to fuck off. Nothing on earth is worth that bullshit. Unbelievable. And people actually think there's salvation in women outside the west. Lol	28
1	Thanks for your advice... This subreddit, along with r/redpill are my first steps to join such a network.    I'm taking all the necessary steps to get the hell out of where as soon as I can... honestly I'd take racist bigotry over a backwards society any day.  The thing about western culture/society is that ~~corrupt~~ media raises the volume of bigots voices.  You can find groups/communities of sane, thinking people if you look hard enough.	28
1	Who cares. Parents aren't infallible. You're the one ultimately living your life, not them. So you make your way. If they don't like it, tough. You should read the book The Manipulated Man by Esther Villar if you haven't already. It is the first homework assignment of MGTOW. It is basically the MGTOW Bible (or Quran). In there is a chapter on how we were raised to be addicted to praise. You can download a free copy in pdf format if you search the title and "pdf".  This book will cure you. Literally.	28
1	Fucking idiot could have given that money to charity and feed some starving kids. Come to think of it, the amount of money manginas waste on women would end world hunger. Puts their pathetic selves in perspective.	28
1	lol bake ur own cake bitch!  erm...... don't use my oven please!!	28
1	I don't think he did it to win her back, but rather rub her face in it. Still fucking blue-pill, since he's inflating her ego by demonstrating that after 7 years he's still hung up on her.	28
1	Yeah, it's hard to be well educated and not support feminism.	28
1	Girls--- do you want your BF to go MGTOW monk? Because this is how you get your guy to go MGTOW monk.	28
1	I am glad that I, as a male, am strong and independent enough to spend 15 dollars on my own pizza (including drinks). Feminists have many more barriers to break.	28
1	A fool and his money are easily parted. At least this way the guys don't actually waste any time dating these pigs.	28
1	MGTOW are more zeta than alpha. Alphas try to impress women with domanance. Zetas DGAF	28
1	I cannot imagine what must go inside a man's head to make him regard buying pizza for a random tinder girl as a good idea. Completely unfathomable.	28
1	The thing is women get off on this on covert power, they're afraid of actual agency so they mock it.	28
1	Thirst for female affection.	28
1	Look on the bright side, before long one of these sloots is gonna dupe a legit psychopath and she's given him her address... Let the games begin.	28
1	Honestly im ok with this. Women will fuck over most men eventually  that is unavoidable but this way many guys get introduced to female nature while only losing a single pizza instead of half of everything they will ever earn.	28
1	And these girls are getting fat on free pizza! I hope they get so horribly obese that not even the most desparate man will give them the time of day.	28
1	I'm not so sure. Some betas/whiteknights will never learn until they're living on the streets.	28
1	Those kinds of men need to lose a lot more and get burned a lot worse before they even consider MGTOW.	28
1	Step 1: Buy pizza.   Step 2: Sprinkle tiny bits of dried dog shit on pizza and melt cheese on top. Step 3: Find clothes that pass as a pizza delivery driver's uniform.   Step 4: Deliver pizza and take tip, if offered, with the biggest smile on your face.   Step 5: ??? Step 6: PROFIT!	28
1	you get charged with rape, assault, trespass, stalking, hurting the feelz, terrorism, etc.	28
1	No one is being "scammed" these guys are just pathetic losers.  "A fool and his money are soon parted"	28
1	This is what happens when desperation becomes your job.	28
1	&gt;I am not risking men's lives so I can live my selfish dream.  I like this one.	28
1	&gt; The determined 35-year-old   Too old	28
1	Shes attractive enough to still garner interest but is a horrible person in real life so the men who show genuine romantic interest at least in part because of her looks spend one date with her and go from "NAWALT? No, AWALT" and walk away.  The second type are the quick lay guys who were lured in because shes a slutty retard leading on in her profile and they think "easy pussy" and when they get on the date they realize shes an entitled princess that expects them to work for 35 year old snatch.	28
1	The amount of entitlement from that pumpkin looking creature is beyond belief.	28
1	When Israelis experimented with women soldiers on the front lines in the 70s they experienced 3 times as many casualties. Women are cowards and a liability in everything. Political correctness is more important than safety in this blue pilled culture.	28
1	Another entitled dime a dozen post wall bimbo slut with an over-inflated view of herself. Lets just sit back and laugh.	28
1	She could have been married again within ten dates. But, no man will ever be good enough for her.	28
1	I think the key is just going your own way, and letting society evolve on its own. I do hope more men realise what is happening and one day, maybe the tides will shift and women will be forced to change their behaviours. But I'm not holding my breath.  That said, the planet is overpopulated up the ying yang, so the last thing we need to be worrying about is procreation.	28
1	It's such a laugh when these women ask "where are all the good men?".	28
1	I don't really care what happens to the human race after me in all honesty. We do enough damage to the planet as it is. I don't care what happens to the mangina's, simps or bp's, I actually quite enjoy reading their horror stories for entertainment. I'm just gonna crack open a beer, enjoy MY life, enjoy reading about my brothers here enjoying their lives.. and ofcourse enjoy watching the downfall. Things are getting interesting.	28
1	Your step 4 needs to be amended. There will not be a tip. The tip is the pleasure of her company.	28
1	let's face it, you didn't want to get married.  Just date and have fun.  There's no way you have made it to 35 as an attractive woman and didn't have opportunities.  You just didn't want to take them.  It's so annoying when people make a choice and then bitch about the choice they made.  I know she's a woman, but be a fucking man and own up to the choice you made and be happy with it.	28
1	&gt;she believes the perfect man is still out there.  *Everyone has to believe in something. I believe I'll have another drink.* -Oscar Wilde	28
1	"Woman goes on 130 free dinners.."	28
1	Quickest way to shut down a feminist about women in the military is one word: draft.   Until women have to sign up for the draft they should be banned from all combat positions. Opportunity comes with responsibility. Oh and don't let them play lipservice to being against the draft. How much of their precious time or resources has gone to abolishing the draft? Fuck all.	28
1	The amount of money and food wasted on relationships with women could end world hunger and poverty tomorrow.  Dogs are superior to women. You don't nearly have feed them as often. Give a dog one biscuit and you'll have to pry him off.   Who wants to spend their lives with some permascowled used up whore with emotional baggage when you can have one of these beautiful, faithful creatures with a permasmile?   http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/images17/SamoyedHolly3YearsOld.JPG   Dogs ARE better than women.	28
1	Lipstick on a biological waste bin with tits is still a biological waste bin with tits.	28
1	Oh I imagine she does want to get married. But her entitlement and hypergamy won't allow anyone that "honor" unless he's Chad Thundercock with a trust fund.	28
1	I could ask "Where are all the good women?" but I'd be branded as a sexist, misogynist monster. Whereas if a woman asks that question, she has no problems whatsoever. BS.	28
1	Any man not marrying her is dodging a very big and bitchy bullet.	28
1	And good old chad isnt dumb enough to marry a 35 year old when an 18 year old is attainable.	28
1	This female veterans' comments will fall on deaf ears because it doesn't follow the feminist narrative.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/05/08/all-remaining-female-soldiers-fall-short-at-ranger-schools-darby-phase/  Yep...	28
1	I always reply "with the good women" the dagger looks i get are priceless, i just grin.	28
1	In the comments section, one of you guys wrote this:  'Gentlemen.  Get a dog.  They are infinitely more faithful and cheaper to feed.'  Nice one!	28
1	She expired 10 years ago.	28
1	The entitlement of western women has entered the stratosphere. There's no signs it will ever come back to earth. Looks like they'll be floating out there alone in space with their spinster girlfriends and cats.	28
1	Butters is speaking a lot of wisdom there.	28
1	Awwww poor, scared little chickies losing their monopoly over male sexuality! They're not going to like it when the Oculus comes out next year and the artificial womb shows up in probably the next 25 years.  I just popped a schadenboner!	28
1	yeah that is what I mean.  I've seen this happen a lot - attractive woman wants to slut it up during her 20's and wait till the sun is setting on her before thinking about anything more serious.  I feel a little sorry for these girls because no one is telling them the truth anymore, which is of course that the best time to find a man and start a family is when you are young, beautiful, and fertile.  This is like me planting my garden in october and cursing the bees for not being there to pollinate it.	28
1	Butters just described why prostitutes should be legalized.	28
1	This gem from the comments section - "Love all the men commenting on here that assume the reason she is still single is all down to her. Not even one has considered there might be some real crappy men out there......" Yup; 130 of them in a row... Seems statistically plausible. /s	28
1	This is what happens when you try to Zerg Rush your way into a woman's heart	28
1	Hey. 60 years ago they said that only the richest people on earth would have a personal computer. And consider that DVD players in 1997 were 700 bucks. I saw a 42 inch flat screen for sale in 2000 for 30grand! Lol	28
1	I'm curious what these are 10 "make or break" factors are?  &gt;Must be 6'+  &gt;Must have a Master's degree, or higher from a prestigious university   &gt;Must make 6 figures  &gt;Never married  &gt;No kids  &gt;Nonsmoker  &gt;Age 34-36  &gt;Must have a passport/be well traveled  &gt;Must live in nice part of city  &gt;Must be fit/athletic   I genuinely am curious. I'm trying to think like her/others like her, and I'm being ridiculously picky. I don't know what's real, and what's trolling anymore.	28
1	and you're making fun of yourself. ;) no offence but if you were in at least few relationships you probably noticed how the patterns are always repeated. if you didn't, then you should.	28
1	No.  It is coming from any honest man or self-reflecting female.  A whore is a whore even if she isn't asking for straightforward payment and ultimately there is always a form of compensation to be had.	28
1	So Zimbardo thinks we ought to look at how men are opting out, but now why (factors such as: false rape allegations, society's view of men as toxic would-be rapists, the general gynocentric roots of civilization, the realities of marriage as a futile slave contract, financial rape, etc.).  Let's debate the effects, but not examine the causes.  Sounds like an articulate diagnostic dissection to me.	28
1	"I predict that in 20 years, computers will be twice as powerful, 10,000 times larger, and so expensive that only the five richest kings of Europe will own one. "	28
1	Or continue to be banned if you're a female emotional parasite	28
1	#13123 "Ladies, do future generations a favour and teach your sons to cook, clean and do laundry so they don't grow up to be the kind of useless assholes most women on this site seem to be married to!"  Another reason im glad to be MGTOW.  Go ahead, teach your sons how to do all of that. That way when they grow up they'ill realize that they dont need a women for anything at all; making it easier for them to take the red pill.	28
1	&gt; schadenboner  Fantastic! I'm 'avin that term! :-D  Edit: talk about motherfuckin *value*... I've caused 3 laugh-out-louds in other people by the correct use of this word in just the last 3 days!	28
1	&gt; own up to the choice you made  Jack Nicholson put it very well in 'As Good as it gets';  &gt;"[for a woman's perspective] I think of a man, then I take away reason and *accountability.*"  As much as I agree with your sentiment, and the rest of what you've said, you need to get past the expectation of women behaving in such a responsible way.	28
1	Or maybe the modern woman is a spoiled brat.  Maybe it's that simple.	28
1	40s is not the 20s. I just found it amusing that manginas actually believe in those shit	28
1	If you're a good-looking dude who doesn't drink like a fish then your 40's can be your new 20's. It just doesn't work for women though. Never ever will.	28
1	Translation: porn and video games are becoming threats to my attention and validation sources!	28
1	That's an excellent point. Women don't mature (mentally) past age of about 25. Those older women saying she's immature? The only response is to laugh in their faces.	28
1	yap. with age they only learn how to deceive and lie better. but they don't mature. important point! :)	28
1	Don't forget the baggage. They usually accumulate more of that as time goes on.	28
1	&gt; pumpkin looking creature  +1 for that descriptor.  :-)	28
1	8:48  "But still... it works, because he's got his shit together, he *provides resources*..."  Why the fuck is this traditionalist horsecrap getting upvoted?  Since when did MGTOW become PUA heaven?  You might as well call me Tom Leykis and say I just need to neg a bitch to show her I'm alpha.  If this is the kind of cunt-craven sycophantry I should expect to find on /r/MGTOW, this subreddit is a fucking disappointment.	28
1	&gt;Stephens was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in jail, to be released after three months.  Seriously?	28
1	Hey she's a woman!  The patriarchy made her do it.  Seriously she's be dead if that were me. No woman is coming at me with a weapon and living.	28
1	Jesus H Christ one  a stick. He described my ex. I live a 13 year nightmare and have no idea how I did not kill myself. Walking away from her is the best 100000 bucks ever spent. I just thank Crom I did not have children with her.	28
1	That is one ugly hambeast.	28
1	Too much effort. Not enough reward. -- *relationships in a nut shell*	28
1	We all take risks, and no matter what woman you experiment with it's going to fuck with you.	28
1	SOLVE their problems.  That is the key. Ruminating over feelings all the time doesn't solve anything.	28
1	&gt; The Red Pill recognizes the way society is, but **then accepts it and tries to adapt to it,** rather than rejecting it outright.  Bingo.  Even the TRP'ers who believe they can successfully be "alpha" -- admit that they have to continuously "hold frame" (ceaselessly, never for a moment letting down their guard) -- which is to my mind, a recipe for a disaster... it's akin to "playing" with poisonous snakes as pets.  That doesn't strike me as very bright -- especially since I really can't see any benefits from all the effort it requires.	28
1	It's an entitlement attitude.  They know that no matter what they look like, there will be plenty of thirsty simps to praise and validate them.	28
1	The problem with your though experiment is that you are assigning typical male thinking to a women. They don't think like that. If they are smart, they will get a degree and marry a rich guy or a guy with potential for getting rich. They will have kids so they cal play the mommy card. They will resent their husband for supporting her and divorce him if bored with life. They will cheat if it is not damaging to their reputation and remarry a richer guy if they can (most can't because older women have less value). Maybe the kids won't even be her husband's.	28
1	GROSS. Environmentalists should be outraged.  Seriously, what is overeating other than selfishness and proof that you're taking more than your fair share? And today it's proof that you support cheap junk food, anything and everything processed, and you're failing to READ LABELS.  People like this make me double down on my efforts to buy fresh fruits and vegetables. Things that don't come in boxes with 60 ingredients. A banana, apple, and orange only have ONE ingredient each. And there's no fucking box to open or box to throw away.  Fucking nasty.	28
1	My favourite thing about these land whales is they would scoff at their lb for lb male counterpart.   Literally everything these days empowers women. It begs the question, if women are so sure of themselves then why do they need constant reassurance that they're great for 'who they are.'	28
1	This is why its best to be self employed.	28
1	Hit the nail on the head there. If they *were* so confident with themselves, they would not be shoving it in our faces with the "LOOK AT ME! LOOK HOW CONFIDENT I AM WITH MYSELF! THIS IS A REAL WOMAN. LOOK!!".   Make no mistake, they *despise* themselves deep down. They've tried every fad worthless diet (without ever actually putting in any real effort mind you). And they give up. Because they're too dam lazy. They're too dam greedy. They're too dam worthless. Thats the truth. And they will never admit it.	28
1	When the reporter says that she found she could not believe that anyone would say that "to a Woman", substitute "Women" for "Noble" or "Wise Guy" or "Lord". Food for thought.	28
1	LOL I never thought I'd see a Brosciencelife video posted on the MGTOW reddit page. This guy is gold, his satire is prefect. The funny thing is, his actual personality is really quiet and relaxed and he has a steady GF of several years, so he's not an MGTOW or a classic "hook up and move on" Red Pill guy, but his ability to spot social BS is great.	28
1	&gt;We don't even have to know a guy to help him out.  The various programming language subreddits are a great example of this. Ain't no girls in there giving free advice.	28
1	Women do not have the ability to concern herself with anyone but herself. Women live in a bubble. And that bubble is on a stage. And everything and everyone in the world are props, stage hands, extras and she is of course the star!	28
1	And when they do they always have this smug arrogance about them. They like to lord their acquired knowledge over everyone.  Men are more humane than women.	28
1	That is a nice thought but the ultimate irony is that you might have helped a guy get a girl's number when ultimately she is going to bleed him dry, cuckold, take his assets and future earnings.	28
1	Very interesting. It is a rather harmless little experiment. But I doubt a teacher could get away with declaring "boy's day" in class in the West without getting fired and shamed for "oppressing".	28
1	Read about the 1st paragraph, but possibly illegal termination in 95% of countries.   If you are not  at working place, why should you care about code of conduct of the working place? It s not like they own you? Are you a slave?  The code of conduct of society is the law and there are courts for that.	28
1	&gt; Are you a slave?  This is a question worth careful consideration...	28
1	Well, that isn't actually true. There are a number of cases where matriarchal societies existed in human history. You've never heard of them simply because they have never accomplished, conquered, built, or invented anything of substance.  There are still matriarchal societies today, but you would have to travel away from a world of creativity, ambition, work ethic, and strength to a backwards hole in the dirt.	28
1	This thread has been linked to from another place on reddit.  - [/r/justneckbeardthings] [Beards have a discussion on whether or not all women are whores](https://np.reddit.com/r/justneckbeardthings/comments/35w4np/beards_have_a_discussion_on_whether_or_not_all/)  [](#footer)*^(If you follow any of the above links, respect the rules of reddit and don't vote.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger/wiki/) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose/?to=\/r\/TotesMessenger))*  [](#bot)	28
1	Serves him right.  Captain Save-a-hoe's get what they deserve.	28
1	&gt; in the debt collector's minds her and I are equally responsible for the loan  Lol no shit	28
1	I don't feel sorry for him one bit. He asked for it.	28
1	A beta and his money are soon parted.	28
1	He literally signed up for it.	28
1	Dumb twats.  This shit gives me a perpetual schadenboner.   Every woman thinks her little pussy is the only one on earth and whatever man she wants will be waiting for her after she's gone through miles of cock.	28
1	MGTOW rule number one, ignore what women say, observe what they do.	28
1	Guys around here will give zero fucks about your disappointment.	28
1	&gt;I have enough dates and flings and past boyfriends to confirm that I’m not a complete monstrosity.  So she thinks riding the cock carousel is something to list in her PRO column?  &gt;I’m bangable. Fun.  A Whore is both bangable and fun and probably would bring more to the table in a relationship than you do. Like, for instance, a steady source of income?	28
1	Yeah.  Sloots are stupid like that.  They think Prince Charming is waiting just around the corner after they've let themselves be used by every thug in the neighborhood.	28
1	so in the same breath she says "Its more complicated than that" followed by "never mind, no its not, its just about equal rights."  That is a pristine example of George Orwell's "doublethink"	28
1	**Some have even described "Fury Road" as a feminist film. "Vagina Monologues" writer Eve Ensler consulted on the movie, working with the actresses playing the enslaved wives.**  Lol, Pass.	28
1	Her face has so much makeup, she is for all practical purposes a porcelain doll , and not a human being.   Also, Briony later admits she had regularly turned down all the, "so-so" guys - and could have married an ex.  So here we are once again. and again and again. These women are all playing like a broken record. Their problems are so easy to diagnose, but yet they still hold out for that Chad who pumped em and dumped em.   Kinda looks like a boy too: http://www.torontolife.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_6205web.jpg	28
1	Yeah,  and we're not man enough to risk our health and security from paternity fraud for the sake of these cum landfills and them alone.   Man up and gamble with hepatitis and HPV, fellas! Or else the wymyn will make fun of you!	28
1	She is aging awfully for her age.  Imagine her in 5-10 years. *shudders*	28
1	&gt;So much feminist propaganda crap, and I'd had such high hopes for this Mad Max movie.  I couldn't finish the new 300, because it is female centric to the point of absurdity. I can't stand these movies with the female-warrior protagonist. So fake	28
1	I guess the ladies aren't as big of fans of being WGTOW as men are as MGTOW. /s  edit: added words for clarity	28
1	Fucking eye bleach warning next time, dude.  Disgusting!	28
1	The thing about women like these is they have zero understanding of basic economics:  ***Low prices attract the most customers.***	28
1	I've seen better in National Geographic.  5 on a good day with makeup.  EDIT: I just saw the website URL. AHAHAHAHAH HOW DID I KNOW THE BITCH WAS FROM TORONTO!  AHAHAHAH we have the ugliest pieces of shit that call themselves women in the history of mankind. Toronto women are legendary and known the world over as being the WORST on the ENTIRE PLANET!	28
1	LOL maybe you need to save your bread and go to central or south america. Get yourself some REAL women. Not these Toronto, Wal-Mart equivalents of womanhood.	28
1	When a woman is introduced as the Editor of a magazine and also with a twitter hashtag that is our collective cue to turn the other way and run.	28
1	WGTOW!  I love it!	28
1	Toronto is one of the most anti-male places on Earth.	28
1	lol deluded bitch. Bangable = after a few beers some bro will want to stick it in as an *alternative* to having a wank... Which is why you've only had "dates" and "flings" you absolute fuckwhit. YOU'RE NOT.GOOD ENOUGH.	28
1	TriggerWarning: My god, she's suggestively lifting that woman's skirt from behind!  That heinous action promotes #RapeCulture, #MaleGaze, and #FemaleObjectification.  /sarcasm	28
1	TIL: My standards are below the bar raised by highly respected member and contributor, "SCROTAL-SACK"	28
1	Top Facebook comment on the article:  &gt;It's called MGTOW ladies, learn to live with it." - Cary Harris  It's growing and going mainstream.  Men are becoming bolder and prouder.  I love it!	28
1	oh christ.. those glasses. When are these twats gonna realise how ridiculous they look.	28
1	Thats a bs fluff article.  She said it herself, shes banging 22 yo's on tinder every week.  And shes fine with that. Of course shes always single, none of those guys are going to commit to her. This is nothing more than satire with some humble brag thrown in. Shes going to ride the CC for another 10 years easy.  Nothing to see here.	28
1	It's so bad I never eat pussy anymore and I liked eating clean fresh pussy.  Pussy is like wild fish, it's contaminated. If this trend continues sexbots will be the norm.	28
1	Yeah, you can get cancer from that now.   Women are the gifts that keep on giving,  eh?	28
1	&gt;I'm fun.  translation: i'm an obnoxious cow who thinks she's interesting because some idiots laughed at my unfunny jokes to get into my pants. (back in the days when she actually was bangable)	28
1	Yeah I saw that. That was EPIC!!   MGTOW will be discussed in the news hopefully and then the WALL will hit like a Tsunami. Expect free blowjobs for every man.	28
1	&gt;I’m bangable.  She trots this out as if it's an monumental achievement for a woman.  There is an old saying that describes how the challenge of obtaining sex differs for men and women: &gt; The key that opens many locks is quite valuable.  &gt; The lock opened by any key is worthless.	28
1	The only way to win this game, is to not play.	28
1	I **loved** the original, because it was a pure unadulterated, unapologetic masculine action film.  Art like that is getting rare in our culture.	28
1	This app actually is good for men.   It only gives 24 hours for the female to initiate the chat otherwise the match is gone. That means as guys you don't have to hit up all the girls for a reply. You can sit back and relax and workout. If she speaks to you it means she's interested.	28
1	Special side note: Suppose you DID win this woman to be your wife, what would you have? She will never be happy with you, quite simply she can't be happy with you. Anybody who drives cattle through their bedroom is a poor choice for a marriage partner.	28
1	HPV in women leads to throat cancer in men so fuck eating pussy.	28
1	There is also this gem (any press is good press): &gt;What is MGTOW an acronym for? ~Inge Gregusch  She's in man-hell Toronto, no less! I bet she was utterly mind-fucked when Googling "MGTOW" for the first time.  Eventually, the mainstream media will be forced to acknowledge its existence.  It will be a breakout moment as millions of men learn how to control their own destinies!	28
1	Oh WGTOW exits bro,  they even had a website and their symbol was a rip off of the MGTOW symbol except it was with arrows in a roundabout. Many remarked it represented a hamster wheel!	28
1	She can speed up time!	28
1	&gt; Eventually, the mainstream media will be forced to acknowledge its existence.    They will, but how is the question.. They need to maintain the narrative so they will probably call MGTOW a cult of misogynistic losers or something like that.	28
1	Yeah Michael Douglas got it from Catherine Zeta Jones.	28
1	Then we men get to choose who we want to engage with not them. I wonder if they will like the outcome of this? Perhaps not as the author of the article finds most are not interested in her after chatting. Probably more Betas on the app than Alphas.	28
1	Sounds like she views the husband hunting process the same way a normal person would view job hunting.  She's trying to build up a long resume of men she banged.	28
1	Sorry, but I'd rather go to Ukraine and find an 18 year old wife.	28
1	Or, "I dance with my arms over my head."   "I stick my tongue out in pictures."	28
1	It is very weird to me that women view "banging" men as a bragging right. While many men have the luxury to be picky now-a-days, there are still droves of men who will jump at the chance to stick it in any hole a woman offers. From my perspective, I would rather know how often she actually orgasms from these sessions (if at all). I would like to know if she feels used or validated when a 22 year old cums in her and never calls again. I would like to know if she feels accomplished for doing something rather easy and mundane.	28
1	I would estimate that at least 80% of men would pork anything over a 4, when you get down to it.  Lots would say no, but if no one would find out theyd be there. If you are familiar with the term hamstering, its where a woman can make any reality suit her defined objectives at the time. Cognitive dissonance.   Id say thats exactly how she does it.  Theres any number of possible ways she could explain it away.  Its how women work and part of what makes them distasteful, IMO.	28
1	Great post.   I know a lot of guys who have this delusion. If it isn't South America then its either Mexico (lots of Mexican descent around here), "asia", or Eastern Europe. Men from all these places report: AWALT.   My favorite phrase was   &gt;Known gringos	28
1	Although WGTOW seems like a parody of MGTOW, I really hope the movement goes somewhere. I hope that it forges some truly independent women that support each other going their own way.  I will actually be disappointed if they waste the opportunity and turn WGTOW into a MGTOW bashing forum.	28
1	&gt;Women Going Their Own Way (WGTOW.net) is for women who have no interest in male chivalry, and no interest in being damselled or pedestalized.  Unfortunately this is not the female version of MGTOW. It's not about going their own way in life and disregarding men. It's about dismissing sexual stereotypes.  There is already a movement for that and it's called Feminism.	28
1	I took a look at the subreddit. The latest post was 7 days ago with no comments and post after that was 5 months ago. It died before it ever started.	28
1	This of course does not apply to women.   This is an excuse to close down subs that they feel are "offensive (to wymyn only)".  Be on guard boys, we had better be prepared to migrate.	28
1	Mel Gibson only had 16 spoken lines in the Road Warrior. Max not speaking is not a new thing. Complain about something else.	28
1	IMO there's no right or wrong choice. There is only better understanding yourself so you can make the decision to lead the best life possible, for you. After you think you understand what that is, you go your own way to achieve it.   A lot of guys who get lost in fantasy worlds do it because they lack the perspective on how to improve in other areas. I've met a lot of guys like that who lead unfulfilled lives, usually serving some kind of ideology they never chose.	28
1	This. I also felt superior when I was getting laid a lot. It only caused me to disgust myself later. Good thing that you realized that you don't need to be an asshole to be a man. Good thing too that you took care of your body and eating. That ultimately benefits yourself. Whatever you chose to do in the future, you are informed and free.	28
1	Also, freedom for me meant understanding male need for motherly love. That is a hard pill to swallow but leads to enlightenment.	28
1	These laws will contribute to MGTOW and weed out the thirsty pussy beggars.	28
1	The funny thing about this is women will still think they are worth risking jail and a ruined reputation for them. They're in for a very rude awakening. They better stock up on Melissa Etheridge CDs and get themselves a crew cut because that's the only road left for them besides professional cat wrangler.	28
1	Many men will go to prison and get raped for real there in the meantime and nobody will raise an eyebrow.	28
1	I see women got bored of the sub, not surprising considering that going their own way is almost impossible.	28
1	They can't jail anyone who doesn't put himself in the position to get accused by these heifers.   Always look at the glass half full, brother. This will aid MGTOW and free men while women will have a dwindling supply of dick. It won't surprise me at all when women start raping men as a result of these laws.	28
1	They priced themselves out of the market. I'd rather put my balls in a vice.	28
1	hahaha "it's not you"  YES IT IS.  Women of value don't make it to 32, unmarried and wanting to be married/coupled. Period.  She's got shit wrong with her she's hiding and when she dates it is obvious and men run.	28
1	MGTOW bros then yeah because otherwise there u have ordinary blue pill bro who will choose hoe every single time (and you just end up loosing a friend) - were wired that way.  most men nowadays still choose vagina over friendship	28
1	&gt; Why does it matter if I'm a "success" in our feminized society's eyes?  It doesn't matter. It is you and you alone who determines if you're a success or not.	28
1	loved the hypocritical stupid drawing showing controlled woman on the strings... it is rather men being controlled now, aye?!	28
1	It was too recent to report any significant change. But it helped shrug of a depression that was not going away with meds (they made it worse) or therapy (feminized bullshit pseudo-science).   Edit: I am not saying not to do therapy if you are depressed. But from what I have seen, therapist tend to downplay female bad behavior (calling psychopathic behavior [BPD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder)) and encouraging you to play by society's rules and get a girlfriend - which *could* be a good thing in times of old.	28
1	Yes I read about that. I also read about I guy that was forced to pay child support after a woman used his sperm from a sperm bank. But if raping man entitles a women to child support... that would be the biggest legal clusterfuck in history... I really hope it does not come to that, but I am not a skeptic of anything anymore	28
1	"So babe... before we have sex... sign here, here and here please."	28
1	I guarantee it will come to that. The gloves are off.	28
1	I know we joke about that but in modern criminal legal systems that contract would be void, because consent can be withdrawn validly anytime without a requirement of form. Strictly legally, you would have to get her to sign a release between pumps in a "yes means yes" system... even then she can claim she was coerced or under duress.	28
1	These laws are just going to act as a catalyst for men to become MGTOWs.	28
1	One more thing to remind me there is no need to date anymore	28
1	My hand and porn collection have never accused me of rape.	28
1	I agree, MGTOW and MensRights are two different things.	28
1	&gt;Why does it matter if I'm a "success" in our feminized society's eyes?  Best. Realization. Ever. Instead of chasing success, I'm gonna pursue my interests and hopefully success is a byproduct, but if not, it's okay.	28
1	100% agree. I have no respect for guys who put their GF ahead of their bros. These white knights lose all my respect. Most of them think they are better than you for having a GF anyways for fuck them.   If my BB friend's GF leaves him I will laugh at his face.	28
1	Wherever men go, women will follow. A wise man once told me: *"don't chase women, follow your dreams, be successful and they will inevitably chase you"*	28
1	Yes but my BB friend in question KNOWS about mgtow and TRP and still goes with this charade. He even lambasted his mgtow uncle calling him a loser. The hamster is strong in this one. The sad part is that he stays with his GF bc they have history together with their families but she's a useless american white girl (bartender, STD, slutty past, flirty with any alpha in the vicinity).   So yeah fuck him.	28
1	the problem is that BP men tend to believe that the 'connection' between him and his LTR is somehow 'special' while the truth is that they are just being used and deceived daily. emotional manipulation at it's finest! 'oh honey drop these bad bad friends, they are so immature and irresponsible, they talk about sleeping with other girls... don't you love me more over them?!' hehe	28
1	AKA   **Reddit CEO comes up with rationalization for more widespread censorship** (of people saying *anything* she doesn't like).	28
1	It's like any other 'controversial' position. You're not under any obligation to discuss it if you don't want to. The two topics you're not supposed to talk about in polite company are religion and politics. MGTOW definitely falls under politics. While I don't think it's a good idea to lie (and say you *want* to get married), there's nothing wrong with saying that you're happily straight and single and don't wish to discuss it further.  Besides, how often to people (besides your parents) actually pry into your life to ask you such questions?	28
1	This assumes that there is something to transcend. There's no purpose in evolution. It just happens. The universe doesn't care who gets to be on top. The universe doesn't care if humans evolve into advanced beings or fall back into the stone age. It's just adaptations to random changes. The need to discover things is just that, another need.	28
1	These fucking leeches won't stop whining until Big Daddy Government completely supports them by channeling more and more tax dollars into the black hole that is single motherhood after being pumped and dumped by some playboy. I am so sick of this. The decline cannot come soon enough; hopefully I get enough capital to move the fuck away from US by then.	28
1	Such a surprise, women want fried ice.  No pressure to be married or in a relationship, BUT the option to have one if they want, without being stigmatized for being in one...and enough income redistribution to make a hardcore Communist wince, just so they can do whatever they want/don't want, regardless of everyone else having to foot the bill.  Hilarious!	28
1	aren't what pgpumpkin2 wrote is going women's own way (in a way?) I mean.. they got everything they want. why they should fucking care to change. think about it for a sec.   It's like being forever 23 years old and want to change this just to 'break through'.  For us, men - MGTOW makes a lot of sense. But for women WGTOW makes no sense as it is against their nature. Besides, AWALT.	28
1	MGTOW is going to dry up the tax revenue. Women will be forced to finance themselves whether they like it or not. The best thing is, men on welfare will be putting wymynz dollars in their pockets.  Glass half full.	28
1	&gt; women want fried ice  Fried ice is so yesterday darling. Vouge says grilled snow is IN this season.  /s	28
1	Keep all the money for my own personal greed so I can finally own a supercar.	28
1	That my first impulse is to consider what *I* think is important, not what others may think is important.  Despite my best efforts, I still consider others' opinions before realizing that mine are more important.	28
1	There's a reason [this became a meme](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/028/590/originaljosephd.jpg).	28
1	Robert Dowey Jr. has the best advice on this "when someone tells you not to do something just nod your head and agree with them. Then go ahead and do whatever the fuck you were going to do anyway."	28
1	This one!  http://i.imgur.com/iyPHcrI.jpg   The hypocrisy from the twat was just through the roof.  Or in her case, through the floor!	28
1	How marriage works   1. Woman changes her husband   2. Then hates what he becomes   3. Divorces him, saying "You're not the man I married."	28
1	Overheard a coworker talking to her friend about getting married, and she said she'd keep her apartment when they moved in together, "just in case"...cue bursts of laughter from both girls.	28
1	&gt; The hypocrisy from the twat was just through the roof. Or in her case, through the floor!  I couldn't believe the hypocrisy of those twats! They hurt a mans feelings by rejecting them for being short and a guys rejects overweight women and they cry foul because it hurts their feewlings! awww, to bad shit heads!  If your fat and the ~~shoe~~ ~~chair~~ bulldozer fits then wear it.	28
1	I could tell you about the goals I have but instead I want to tell you about the very last and also most important goal for me which is actually a sum of all smaller goals I could reach in my lifetime:  It's passing away with a good conscience and an inner smile and also peacefulness.  I shit you not, this would be the greatest accomplishment in my life. The imagination to die dishonored in front of my sense of self truely frightens me.	28
1	It seems to me that you have a warrior spirit. I respect this and hope that you always follow your personal way in life.  I'm proud of having gone through several mental battles and a lot of tough and lonely circumstances in my life which all made me to the person that I am right now. I'm grateful that I didn't give up at any time and didn't end my life when things were way to much for me.	28
1	&gt; When you are 35, unmarried with no kids, you will have a lot of money leftover.   I had to sort of explain this backwards a few days ago.  Somebody asked me how I had been able to retire in my forties.  I said it was because I was no good with women when I was younger, so had never had a family to support.  Sells the MGTOW message as a kind of mental earworm for other guys who are still blue pill to think about, without being overt about it or putting any labels on it for SJWs to tackle you to the ground and silence you.	28
1	Because I have honor and integrity. I have the ability to put myself outside of a situation and view it objectively. Ohh and I can run fast, like really fast!	28
1	So how many nano seconds would it take for the faminazis to attack me if I posted a article titles "how to train your wife" ?	28
1	literally everything - there's no limits. Submit to no woman and to no government, no bullshit and just go. Travel, hike, build stuff, design things, program computers, learn to be a chef, anything. Learn to grow your own food. Read big interesting books you never got around to before	28
1	I can't understand how this is infuriating. I'm tearing here laughing on this kid fury.   "Save your sister from getting harpooned"   "Waiting you to finish your second lunch"  This is CK level comedy here!	28
1	&gt;I wanted to give you time to get back from your second lunch       fucking lost it	28
1	If ever there was an example for not to get into a relationship, this is another. That bitch should be dumped immediately and charged with property damage.	28
1	time to leave and use this as ammunition in the custody hearing.	28
1	* Become financially independent in my early 30's and retire. * Move to another country, leaving the U.S. of A. behind forever. * Travel the world (backpacking/by bike as much as possible). * Play video games and watch anime when I'm not travelling.	28
1	worst thing I ever did to get sex:  trust.  Man, I'll never do that again. Caution is the watchword from now on.  Going to strange places to have sex: I don't care. I go to strange places to do *everything* so my motto on that is be aware, armed &amp; prepared with an exit plan. That's just life.  True though, a good wank means no risk of crazy chicks, false rape claims or even just normal bullshit attitude women have, just to get your rocks off.	28
1	"I want to find a man so I can get pregnant and get child support"  36 year old co-worker (not anymore: thankfully quit)	28
1	The whole thing actually made me feel uncomfortable to read. I feel awful for the guy having to put up with a bitch like that, but cringed at the fact that he's so weak and beaten he actually felt the need to explain himself in that first comment. ugh.. Makes me happy that Im not a pathetic simp like some guys.	28
1	"will you marry me?"	28
1	Never stick your dick into crazy, and surely do not impregnate them. Unfortunately I am speaking from experience.	28
1	What IS interesting is how quickly a guy like this can swallow the red pill and change with the help of the MGTOW community. In the blink of an eye he can find his balls. That piece of trash masquerading as his woman will think lightning struck her.	28
1	This is offtopic, but reading terms like "womyn" and "wimmin" I always thought that these are just mocking nicknames for women given by us people.  Apparently it's not, and I'm heavily surprised! These are not made up terms and feminists really want women to be called like that because there's "men" in "women". I'm quite amused by this fact and it seems that there are still dark and retarded places in a feminist's head that I didn't come across hahaha.	28
1	The problem is, that with the really crazy ones you don't find out until it's too late.	28
1	She's so crazy she would probably lie to police that he had raped her if he tried to break up with her.    He's in a tough position.	28
1	I can't handle such strength and independence. Can you?	28
1	And you gave me the opportunity to do so. *THAT* is the power of MGTOW, RedPill, DarkEnlightenment, or any counter-culture. Interesting encounters with different perspectives that expand our own. I would have never written that on another part of reddit... but I would have never found the words "I am proud to be a man" anywhere else on reddit either.	28
1	First mistake: getting a girlfriend.  Second mistake: making a baby.  Third mistake: sticking around.   MGTOW for life.	28
1	Sorry, I'm pro trp/mgtow but that guy did a shit job defending his beliefs.	28
1	This sort of stuff belongs in /r/mensrights	28
1	Guy needs to have a SHITLOAD more practice on his own theme -- he comes across as weak, apologetic, and pretty much ball-less... I mean good god, he's *stuttering.*  No offense to guys who stutter, but it is something they CAN overcome -- takes a lot of effort but it can be done -- and if they are **intending/planning** to do this kind of (prime time public-TV "spokesman") stuff, then it's something they need to manage ahead of time.	28
1	Even though he held no frame... the hosts kept taking the point he was trying to say then blanket all women...  "Feminism had become very insidious"  Hosts "why are you blaming women for being insidious"  "Male suicide is at an all time high"  Hosts "in rural areas men are killing themselves... not a problem on university"  Derail and reframe his points... that's a tough crowd.	28
1	This is why I only visit this sub and do not follow it. If you're still angry at women - you don't get it. Anger is not our victory. Self-definition is. They say anger is a phase in MGTOW. People love to play off all sorts of insecurities.  We don't waste time on anger, we pursue ourselves.  If you're a virgin and still secretly angry that women don't fuck you, you're not a MGTOW. You're a forever aloner trying to self-medicate. You can't get over it if, at a subconscious level, you think women hold something you need.	28
1	I'm over the anger, but not the absurdity.  I can't fathom how women have gotten away with being such absurd human beings for so long and that many men actually indulge, encourage, and reward them for it.  If I want a clown I'll go to the circus, but the circus is all around us.	28
1	I think the resounding sentiment is that you shouldn't ever stick your dick in crazy. It looks as though OP (or the guy OP's talking about) stuck his dick in the crazy juice not once but twice.	28
1	I know the feeling. I got there at 23.   It is 100% possible.	28
1	&gt;except the fact that her video is extremely sexist and points out that all women should be at home serving her partner  Oh, the Patriarchy!	28
1	Lol at the comments. All those women actually think they're getting married someday.  MGTOW says HELL NAHHH	28
1	In a world of lies, truth is treason.  In a matriarchy to be a man is criminal in and of itself.	28
1	Should be "Dear Future Husbands".   Some one should make "dear future wife" parody out of this, the social media barrage should be fun.	28
1	Good luck. More likely the judge is female, remarks (family court!!) "Wow, my husband forgot my birthday once too. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS CHILD SUPPORT awarded to Mrs Castration!"	28
1	cartoons, and almost literally everything they watch is indoctrination.	28
1	Regardless of MGTOW, the ultimate irony is that guys that look like the guys in this video will mostly just use thin-lipped fat bitches like this chick for pump and dump while they sing their demands for their future husbands to their cats, their wall or at twitter.	28
1	Let them have their unrealistic fantasy of having a husband. I'll just be over here teaching young men not to waste theur life over some entitled slag	28
1	Spread the gospel, brah!	28
1	Fuck the gospel we are doing triage.	28
1	Dear future indentured servant.	28
1	She looks like Mrs Doubtfire	28
1	There is a [mangina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI5ueWymeJA) version	28
1	They don't want a husband. They want a wedding and an ATM machine	28
1	And I take it as my personal duty to tell our ignorant brothers this fact.	28
1	The lyrics are unbearably bad like every other song she has. I think this one tops her fat ass self acceptance song. *Cringes*	28
1	Dear Meagan Trainor: Thanks for contributing to the movement.  If we had ten more of her, we could speed up the collapse to within a decade.	28
1	My 13 yr old nephew, told me his girlfriend sent this to him. They're no longer together.	28
1	Of course she's the primary victim, it's not like they were laying down their lives for her safety or anything /s	28
1	I think that came from a Hillary speech.. Even most women think that is stupid.	28
1	This must be why they routinely cheat on their partners who are fighting wars and divorce them.	28
1	Stick with the classics.   Hollywood is dead.	28
1	&gt;Misogynist: A man who treats women the way women treat each other, which is to say, rather poorly.   H.L. Mencken	28
1	What absolute human garbage these women are.   I'm at a loss for words. And we still have guys who consider them human beyond a physical sense!   Edit: here's a relevant video   http://youtu.be/koJzm5tz9j8	28
1	I don't understand why every time you disagree with a feminist on an issue they take it as a personal attack.	28
1	Army Infantry (PMOS: 11C / SMOS: 19D) Tikrit, Iraq 06-07. How about you?  *Oh!* I thought you looked familiar. Pretty butt hurt about that other thread, huh? Sounds like you've got some real tough problems..	28
1	That's an ode to domestic abuse.	28
1	Saw it yesterday.   Very good movie, over the top crazy, better even than the original Mel Gibson Mad Max.   The dual guitar player was just wild, cracked me up.   Loved Theron's character, she was just awesome.   Definitely NOT gynocentric, that's just stupid.  Tom Hardy did a great job as Max, so what if he shared the screen with an equally awesome Theron character, it just made the movie all the more interesting and exciting.  You want to see a boring, overly saturated CGI movie??   go see Avengers.   I walked out of that one	28
1	Report her to HR and tell them she is making you feel uncomfortable and you feel threatened.  Really tell her your boyfriend will not like you talking to her, that should turn her off.	28
1	Hello.  I suggest that you inform your supervisor or even HR of the situation. If you decide to confront her about it one-on-one then she'll probably get offended or defensive and flip the script on you and tell people at work that you've been harassing her.  Someone nutty enough to follow you into the men's locker room for your attention is likely not a very stable person so be careful.  Get others involved and good luck	28
1	Have her charged with sexual harassment.  I am dead serious.  If you're going to be one of those guys who will chicken out of doing this then you deserve what you get.	28
1	I second that. If this isn't sexual harassment, then what is? Flip the genders and I guarantee she'd have already charged the OP.	28
1	True. But when a man accuses a woman of harassment he needs a year's worth of wiretaps and video evidence.	28
1	I use to watch Agents of Shield. I can't watch that crap anymore. Every week I see a 5 ft. tall woman kick the ass of a 6'6'' 250 lbs harden criminal who looks like a line backer for the Dallas Cowboy. Really? Why do they have weight classes in boxing. Because a lightweight boxer can't beat a heavy weight.  Yet over and over again, we see women beat the shit of men. This is partially the reason why you see more and more women hitting men. They believe what they see on the screen.	28
1	Don't change clothes at work anymore, and let your bosses/hr know why that is. You don't need to change at work, and you don't need the situation you were in to occur again.  Put in a formal complaint about her if you believe that is going to go your way.   Finally, get the boyfriend's phone number/email and send him evidence of what a whore she is. If a woman wants to be a slut, that's her privilege, but taking someone else along for the ride without their consent isn't something I approve of. If my partner was being a whore I'd want to know about it.	28
1	It's from Sun Tzu's Art of War, so....	28
1	But that's "positive discrimination" and women are still the victims!   /s	28
1	Yeah, easily.  The older I get and the more older men I met who are married, the more I realize how under the thumb they are. It's hell, in a way. They start off joking about it, but you soon realize, especially after a few beers, how down they really are.  But realize some men have a *need* to be used as a utility by a woman because they know no different.	28
1	Truth.  I was drinking with one of my brother-in-laws and he eventually confessed that he was miserable and wished he never got married or had kids.  He followed up with saying that the only reason he pressures me to "settle down" and have kids is so that I'll be as miserable as he is.	28
1	Been this way since 13. I learn from watching. And what i've seen is not good. Every single relative i've talked to at a party, once they get a few beers in them and there out of ear-shot of there wives told me the exact same thing "don't get married, it's not worth it".	28
1	That's more sad that anything else.  These men KNOW what they want, but are too scared to go for it.    What's fun is the opposite end of this; their women know the same thing we/they do, and thus *hate* people like us for fear they'll give their mealticket ideas.    Most of my married friends say their wives dislike them hanging around me even though I've always been kind and courteous.  Yet despite not liking me, whenever they see me they try to hook me up with friends/relatives.	28
1	&gt;She thinks he's cheating on her. Non stop bitching.  this is likely her projecting, and she herself is cheating or thinking about it.	28
1	&gt;&gt;She thinks he's cheating on her.  &gt;this is likely her projecting  Projecting, or more likely the proverbial "hamster" creating a rationale for her own cheating... she wants another round on the CC, and is just trying to justify it.	28
1	&gt; What's fun is the opposite end of this; their women know the same thing we/they do, and thus hate people like us for fear they'll give their mealticket ideas.   There is a REASON why women *force* men to give up their "single" friends.	28
1	I read something during psych that someone who is doing something immoral (often cheating) will try to accuse the other of doing it first as a deflection technique to both buy time and give themselves a justification. i.e., he's cheating too so I did nothing wrong.	28
1	I second that. they see you as a danger, because you are raising knowledge, speaking up your mind and- of course-you're arent under her influence.	28
0	Yah brah, I suck cawk all day... if they aint got cawk, they aint beautiful brah!  If you find short chubby girls with bad teeth beautiful, knock yourself out tiger. I know they are easy too.	28
0	Thanks everyone for your different perspectives. I found the discussion surrounding red pill and MGTOW especially interesting.  Do you know how MGTOW began?	28
0	Dude, if all a woman is good for to you is an untouched vagina, you are missing out on a lot.    With all sincerity and friendliness, get some therapy, my friend.  When your initial premise is "half the population is just a hole to me," it says you're not allowing yourself to see them any other way.	28
0	If women did not have a vagina few to no men at all would want anything to do with them. Women are for child birth and an occasional lay. If men want anything else he has his family, friends and dogs.  Take your phantasmagorical female divinity bullshit back to your weak ass sub. I'm sure pussy beggars there will be delighted. Fucking amateur.	28
0	1) If your therapist told you this, you need a new therapist.  Sex doesn't fix anything in the long term.  2) If you are so concerned about the division of assets in a divorce, pre-nup?  3) Are you the manufacturer of snake oil?  That's not an attack, I am sincerely having trouble following your train of thought.  4) I did not diagnose you.  I'm not a psychologist.  I'm politely suggesting, as a fellow human being, that you should seek counseling.  I don't pretend to know what bothers you. :)	28
0	1) Thank you for nullifying your own previous statement.   2) Prenups are routinely thrown out of court, fool. Even lawyers know they aren't worth the paper they're on. They can say she was coerced into signing.   3) Because you think like a woman. All emotion, zero logic.   4) You can't suggest counselling without diagnosing, fool. Otherwise, I'd need counselling for eating and sleeping.   Your rationalization and thought process mirrors that of every female I've talked to. Good luck with that, mangina.	28
0	I'm not trying to convince you (I'm not married, btw :) ) I'm just trying to talk to you like a person.	28
0	Manginas are not human. They are drones. Little worker bees for cupcake.	28
0	Why do you hate people you call manginas?	28
0	There's that word again. Manginas are not people. They are tools.	28
0	Honest question: is this kind of "robotic" speech a sign of something else? I'm not trying to be derrogatory here, it is a honest question. I know I'm certainly showing prejudice here. It is just that when I see someone talking like this it sounds so weird, like a bad actor, or when a seargent is giving commands to a troop.	28
0	not too bad? I could perfectly live the rest of my life like this.	28
0	I feel sorry for you.	28
0	Dude I put this up as a topic for discussion and feedback. There is absolutely no need to start YELLING at me?    You saw the line in the blog where I said that right.  Preaching to the choir here and I let me say this again I put this out a discussion topic and was looking for feedback. Wasn't planning to do this got that?	28
0	Too bad only men who check their hair every 10 minutes or remember to wash their hands will see it...	28
0	Cut welfare for the irresponsible	28
0	Exactly. Any citizen of the United States whom is being paid less for their job than a person doing the exact same job merely has to ring up the EEOC and turn the employer in.	28
0	You can have whatever theory you want about the weaknesses in each gender and how to behave, but if you want to have kids in a "normal" way, a romantic relationship is the only route.	28
0	Again with the insults and calling out such behaviour you resorted to insults AGAIN!   Tell me dude do you really think I should take anything you say seriously? If I was speaking that way to you how would you react.   Here's a good thought for next time INSULTING the poster pretty much negates any point you made, because well quite frankly I'm not interested in reading or listening to anything else you say after that. Doing it again reduces you down to at best an immature troll.  Pretty much going to ignore anything else you say if you do it again, CLEAR?	28
0	French women are the best, vivacious and sexy, in a very sexual sensual society. Japanese women are the very best, but hard to access. American/Canadian women have become masculine basically. Great rugby players, and wanting in on the NHL.	28
0	Lol. And she banged him later on in the evening. I don't give a shit about domestic violence, rape or any other sympathy whoring bullshit. 9 times out of 10 it is the woman's fault. They get off on the abuse. Twisted muthafuckas! 😆	28
0	I see it as an invasion of a male space, nothing more. And nothing she could possibly say would be new or even useful to those who have experienced it first hand, ie men. Many dudes come to mgtow because it is one of the very few places where men can gather without women.	28
0	You are fucked up.	28
0	You know this is a men's forum don't you? 😯  Mods!  Another one got through.  Shoo shoo shooooo!	28
0	Your sense of justice is equivalent to a feminist demanding alimony payments from a broken man.   You really are a sick person.	28
0	Aaron Clarey, a white knight? What are you smoking son	28
0	You can petition it and if APA refuses to honor the deal....	28
0	And we're done!  You've demonstrated that you're incapable of acting any better than a 10 year old. Therefore I'm going to regard you as such.   Good Bye	28
0	depends on the jurisdiction but it may be the case	28
0	What more do red pillers need to know?  What a ridiculous excuse.	28
0	well... no. In other cultures there's other ways. Like the woman being property and having no rights at all. You may feel it's wrong but when a man is divorce-raped he really is the property now so what's the difference?	28
0	There probably are gay MGTOWs. You're not one, I'm not either, but so what?  That doesn't mean they don't exist. They're men with men's issues on living life - certainly without being destroyed by women - so they should be welcome here	28
0	no: FITNESS &amp; genetic value above confidence. Some are wrong to say otherwise but it's true. Those men who are most fit - exercise &amp; good genetics - are the strongest and many in theredpill subreddit admit the truth. It is the one truth.	28
0	From Macleans, an "American" news source.   &gt; Last Friday, Bill C-36, the new federal anti-prostitution legislation that criminalizes those who buy sex (known as “the perverts” to Justice Minister Peter Mackay) officially came into force. (The timing was unfortunate as it coincided with the national day of action for violence against women.)  &gt;Under the new law, it’s also illegal to “knowingly advertise an offer to provide sexual services” and get “material benefit” from the sale of sex.   http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/roundup-canadians-respond-to-the-new-prostitution-law/	28
0	From the Globe and Mail, another "American" purveyor of propaganda.   &gt; The bill criminalizes the buying of sex – or “obtain[ing] for consideration… the sexual services of a person.” The penalties include jail time – up to five years in some cases – and minimum cash fines that go up after a first offence.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canadas-new-prostitution-laws-everything-you-need-to-know/article19610318/?service=mobile  I find that guys who profess to know it all are often easily made fools.	28
0	The acceptance and even promotion of using escorts in the MGTOW scene is getting a bit out of hand imho.   Please keep in mind that using escorts is a direct wealth transfer of men to women solidifying hypergyny. You are paying for something that she is not only getting for free, but even paid to do.  Not wise imho. Same goes for cam whores, paying for porn, strip clubs and so on.	28
0	&gt;There probably are gay MGTOWs  Wtf are you talking about????? Gay people aren't straight people.  &gt;so they should be welcome here  Why don't you go to a gay community and tell them you identify with some shit that they're going through with relationships because you're straight and you "understand." Become an advice guru for homosexuals too. When you're celebrated as the straight king of your local gay community, come back and tell Reddit all about it.  I don't think you fully understand what MGTOW is, dude.	28
0	Baby Rabies, run!  Also, I want to point out that if this were a case of a man's ex getting knocked up and deciding to have that baby against his wishes she'd be getting so many "you go girl!"'s while telling the ex-boyfriend to "man up".   Feminism gents it stands for equality! /s	28
0	And 17 is the age of MGTOW	28
0	And if u don't believe me ask ur dadd	28
0	what's the problem is knowing gender not aloud and I'm not a troll :|	28
0	I just didn't know if I was welcomed here thas all not attention whore I wouldn't come here for attention 😂 and no i didn't read about that	28
0	so I shouldn't be here or am I welcomed? society never programmed be either I'm 15 :/	28
0	idk. do what you want. go your own way.   and if you're only 15 then you have a long way to go before you even realize how programmed you are.	28
0	In what way am I programmed lol I'm not a robot and not a sheep	28
0	It's subconscious. It's behavior that you don't even realize you're doing. Certain things you might do to get attention, ways of interacting with males, how you view your own self worth as well as that of males.   You might be completely right in saying you don't have any such tendencies, and it's certainly possible. Just very very unlikely.	28
0	yes but everyone is unique and how they are raised judge usually by how arrogant they are ect..	28
0	She sure did, and I am able to understand she had a severe narcissistic disorder. I didn't tactfully break up with her, which caused her wrath. No, I don't deserve it, but part of being a man is admitting when you could have avoided unfairness by being mature yourself.  And I'm still able to have my viewpoint, because I understand people as well as the fact that outliers exist. You can't be afraid to leave your house out of fear of catching a deadly disease or of death by a car. You'd then sit in stasis without living life.	28
0	Imo uniqueness doesn't exist. Not in a society that mass produces in a uniform way everything from entertainment to clothing to food, and beyond. Even behavioral patterns are more uniform among people than unique.   We each have individual taste and style, but I'd say humans are far from being unique from one another.	28
0	everyone is unique if we weren't me and u would be the same 😁😁 or were u specifically talking about girls cause everyone has subconscious things they do	28
0	You do not speak for me, white knight.	28
0	i cant stand make spaces? what?	28
0	i don't want my own sub lol and wtf is a male space this is the internet	28
0	This sub has a moderator. It's only a matter of time before he kicks you. So why don't you pack up all your little dollies and take a flying fuck at a moving vehicle. Preferably an 18-wheeler. Mmkay?	28
0	it never said I couldn't be here and idc if a moderator kicks me off cause I could still read here :]	28
0	oh fuck off, im not white knighting.  if MGTOW to you means excluding people solely based on gender, then you're doing it wrong.   It's Men Going Their Own Way, not Men Going Out of Their Way To Exclude Others.  I for one have no problem having conversations with women about intelligent or philosophical topics. But if you do, that's your thing, and I won't speak for you.  Same goes for anyone else that shares this guy's opinion on my post.	28
0	this is why this place has a bad rep huh?	28
0	I don't want older attention from men I'm 15, and this place is all about women? I thought it was about sharing views on the way society has changed ect:|	28
0	So the proper reaction to a suspected troll is to engage in insults and counter-trolling? What happened to benefit of the doubt? Damage control can be handled if the poster does prove to be a troll.  Isn't MGTOW supposed to be about thinking and acting based on reason, rather than emotion as we have been taught to do.  Now I will admit that I'm a bit naive, and tend to hope for the best out of people more often that I should. A symptom of that emotional response programming.	28
0	omg now I'm getting annoyed first of all I'm not here for any of you offering 'teen pussy' second, if a post here isn't some sob story about some poor guy who got screwed over in the past by a woman it's instantly a troll post? and yes I've discovered mgtow then made this account to ask a question -a question-! this isn't attention seeking bs  gosh	28
0	I don't know what u mean by exploit the labor of men? I don't tell them to work their job they do it by themselves and I've never had a job myself so idk how men are treated	28
0	im confused I just wanted to know if yall would hate me if I was here	28
0	Way to interpret what I wrote literally, genius. The clear parallel is beyond you, I guess.  Having a fun sexual relationship with a woman and sharing with her a bond - which can make the sex even better and which can leave you with a great partner to be around at least temporarily - are both things you lose by sticking with prostitutes. You are left with sex that feels just about as good as jacking off. You live in a stasis.	28
0	You're pretty much admitting you have social problems if you can't understand the point that bonding with a woman is a positive experience and that it elevates sex from some boring, mechanical thing similar to masturbation to a more social, exciting thing.  I haven't used prostitutes, but I have had sex very fast with women who were practically strangers. The sex was way worse than having sex with a girlfriend of even a few weeks.	28
0	In your rambles, you completely ignored the point that mechanical sex is about no better than masturbation. Sex is a social thing, and it feels a lot better when two people bond.  The point of me bringing up promiscuous sex with random women is that the encounter is near-prostitute in interaction (except it was free). It is mechanic and boring.  &gt; therewith  Thanks for confirming again you are just antisocial and simply can't fuck women the normal way.	28
0	The irony here is that you are the one shit testing. As beta as he sounds, you sound effeminate. He loves women, you resent them. It doesn't make a difference, women are still the center of attention.  Anger doesn't equate to power. That's where we will always beat the feminists. Quit throwing the shit back in their cages. Unlike them, we have reason. Use it.	28
0	I said "just let it go... go fucking live your life. that should be the creed."  so who are you talking to?  this is bullshit... Im not white knighting, im not making this a nice space, and im not on his case about the language.  first thing of being a man is to start thinking logically and stop this bullshit where you project all your garbage on to people.	28
0	you are just projecting things on to me, instead of discussing the points. If I refuse to let you characterize me with your projections... you say im angry... im not and even if i was it would be irrelevant because Its not about me.   I wonder why you cant discuss the points I make, in fact you don't seem to disagree with them.... you just have to make things up about me so that you feel right. thats a hamster. its very weak.	28
0	men are talking?   You are straight up having a temper tantrum and calling me names.	28
0	not at all, ill let you in on another secret... in a debate if you lose you temper you lose the debate.	28
0	I do what i want and right now educating you is what i want to do, you are worth it. Love you!	28
0	(Scratches head, trying to figure out headline of this post.)   Now why on Earth would I lie about my occupation? When I pull up to her place in that thing, there just aren't a lot of choices--- and a couple of them are bad ones*. So, the truth is a better choice for me.  (*Hey--- it's a cargo van, no windows in the back. It doesn't take much imagination to come up with bad choices for an occupation.)	28
0	I in no way believe 6ft, skinny, blonde hair, blue eyes is the perfect human. I'm going off the classic Hitler-esque Nazi belief of what the master race might look like. I'm not an anthropologist or a eugenicist and couldn't tell you what the ideal human would be but I know someone tried playing god in the 30's and 40's and millions died cause they didn't make the cut. It's a slippery slope is all.  I wish the best for our species and want to see the diversity flourish, not be snuffed out by what isn't trending generations from now.	28
0	Why don't these guys just adopt kids? Going their route seems selfish, especially since they're getting old.	28
0	this post is not about making a nice spot... here, its about helping people become aware of the choices they are making when they are wallowing in self pity and anger. the question is can r/MGTOW grasp?	28
0	im gonna tell you something else, you can down vote me for saying that you have to take responsibility for your self and better your self... and choose to be happy and healthy.  what a bad thing to say, i didnt know i was on r/bluepill	28
0	im not angry at all... and as long as you refuse to tune into where im coming from you will take it personal and project anger on to it.  i said take responsibility, that is always the first step, no one is going to fix your life for you, no one cares. Its up to you, and this is the furthest thing from a socially conditioned mangina that you can possibly be.	28
0	i have one account, so it wasnt me... so, even if it was, but its not,  that is irrelevant.  who i am is irrelevant to what i am saying.  what i am saying stands logically on it own.  you dont want to enter into debate so you talk about me...	28
0	You have an awesome view, bro.  Have you ever thought about trying out as a Life Coach at Manmood Academy?  At Manmood Academy, we teach men how to deal with women, to maintain frame and spin plates. Join Manmood Academy now! First month's membership is free. We have annual seminars where you can meet fellow men and learn from expert PUAs! (Expert PUAs are PUAs who each have seduced 100+ women. Total combined, our PUAs' score exceed that of Wilt Chamberlain's)  Just remember that PUAs are the Alpha Studs of the manosphere! You can be one too!	28
0	how am i entitled?	28
0	yea make false accusations because you are intimidated and taking this personally... then when confronted... bail out and be done with it.	28
0	thanks ill just be sitting here wondering if you know what entitlement is for the rest of my life.	28
0	the point is when you are done with women, you are done   i mean really done... and done is done.   you don't waste your time crying over them and about them... you go and live your life.  you just accept that things are the way they are, and you choose to be the way you want to be independent of the way things are.  this is emotional freedom, and self control, and both are prerequisites for being an adult male.	28
0	Definitely.  But the same can be said for many of us on this forum, especially the most vitriolic.	28
0	Calling yourself a red piller while choosing the blue pill and not waking up to the fact that the people you might want to date also have minds of their own strikes me as silly.	28
0	Ahahahahaha. Again.  This study found that a higher number of women who had no other sexual experiences were generally more happy in their marriage.   This could mean that the women who had experienced several partners set higher standards sexually for their marriage. How in the absolute fuck does this make virgins "better than" non-virgins unless all you want is a compliant mate who doesn't challenge you in any way?  This is absolutely not a scientific proof that virgins are better than non-virgins. Unless you also have a peculiar way of defining "better than".	28
0	Yes, women's advice are completely worthless. If you live in a community of men and are gay.  If, on the other hand, you interact with women, then those womens advice are worth the same as those of the men you interact with.  You can claim that I have a fundamental misunderstanding of something if it makes you feel better. That doesn't make your comparison between taking a womans advice for dating women and taking a blind mans advice for driving any less insane :)	28
0	I'd choose someone who knows what they want sexually over someone who doesn't know what they're doing any day.  And cum dumpster? Really? as if you believe that semen stays inside whoever it's put into indefinately? You should perhaps read up on biology and sex before venturing into exploring with a partner for the first time. it'll do you good ;)	28
0	When people request a simple summary of why you think something is true and you reply with rhetoric, you should start suspecting you might be in something similar to a cult.	28
0	As if I've told you about myself and what I want any more than you have.   You are a lonely young soul seeking affirmation that what has happened to you and the reason you don't deal well with women are the fault of someone else.  You do not care about me, or a lot of other people other than male friends, and your opinions are not surely to change. Which is the reason that I have the kind of 'company' mentioned in book 4, verse 1, and you don't.	28
0	What does this have to do with men going their own way? Did i stumble upon r/feminism?	28
0	Dance puppet, dance!	28
0	leave him alone he doesn't have any issues with anger.	28
0	So I don't care.	28
0	this is legally a bit tricky since its a grey area if a citizens arrest is required, if she was stealing goods then yes, but failure to pay for a service might fall under consumer law and he is not warranted to restrain her, he should have called the police	28
0	Fuck sandman, he's annoying and repetitive.	28
0	Hold up... I just made you waste a hot dog over a troll post?  😂😂bruh.. #score	28
0	Naw that a feminist doin dat	28
0	Hey guys, I'm very interested in the social consequences of the MGTOW movement. I wrote up some thoughts.  Let me know what you think!	28
0	Did you read the article?	28
0	Fair enough point. Thanks for explaining!	28
0	on cue, here is exhibit A every one ^	28
0	Hello Barney how's Baby Bop?	28
0	“Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.” – Yoda  when you are ready to stop punishing your self, you will let go of this anger and stop promoting it, because you will realize you are only hurting yourself, when you try to hurt others.	28
0	It's spelled weird, you placid cretin.	28
0	Wow, very thorough and well thought out reply. Do you mind if I embed this on my site? I disagree with your conclusion on the micro scale (myself and one woman, but perhaps that's just superman syndrome :P ), but that gulf may be uncrossable.   As far as MRAs go we are on similar, although not identical, pages. When I refer to MGTOW being good for men's rights, it's not in a direct sense. Rather as more men stop showing such self-destructive deference towards women, the balance of power will inevitably shift towards men.  Once again, really great comment.	28
0	I don't see the problem here. You're free to buy whatever toys you want, they're just not put into pointless categories straight off the bat. Freedom from gender stereotypes is an excellent thing and should be celebrated if you resent female nature because active intervention is just about the only thing that *might* result in change at some point in the distant future.	28
0	Hate is fun! Revenge even funner!	28
0	You know how I know you're very much in preacher mode? Because you took my replies to an obvious troll seriously. The truth is you have all your sermons rehearsed and ready to go. You were just looking for an opportunity to preach and you found it here. Look at how easy it is to bait you. This tells me you are grotesquely insecure which is borne out of fear.   Now if you excuse me I feel like a little bit of misogyny right now. Maybe a touch of racism too.   Man it feels good to hate!  "I rest my case"   No you don't.   You'll be back.	28
0	Male feminists piss me off.	28
0	Except none of that applies to them douche	28
0	It had a decent soundtrack, though. (if you ignore the lyrics)	28
0	Yep. She didn't have to keep a job or move higher in her 'field'. So she's still making $9/hr getting child support for my brother and sister, and living with her boyfriend who pays for everything (he was dumb enough to even get engaged after she's been through three marriages). I mean, I love her and she's good, but she's just a leech to men in every way.	28
0	Sounds worse than the west for men and people act like the women have it worse there. Don't understand looking down on computer fields. Pretty much the future of most jobs.  Supposedly  most Arabs are on welfare in Europe as well. They're in no position to look down on anybody especially since they're basically primitives.	28
0	fuck that logic. you accept to go on dates if the individual has not removed the option of sex from consideration, but time is needed to secure the outcome you want.	28
0	Lol.  In MGTOW we call it a schadenboner!	28
0	Exactly. That's why I never listened to other people's advice. Some guys are real lucky and have no trouble. Other guys get scolded so much that the women turn them into insecure guys, only to say they don't like insecure guys. I was intimidated by women a lot when I was young. Maybe that's why I can't talk to them. You get used to them yelling and getting offended so you just give up. Even when you're not hitting on them they get mad. Some guys have fortunate coincidences, which get to their head and they're confident.	28
0	Women will understand that they are in fact inferior and actually respect men. Women would actually be treated better than they are today and be happier in this society. Just as they were happier before feminism became commonplace. There is a reason women disproportionally use anti depressants and are generally less happy than they were 60 years ago.	28
0	Traditionalism is the best option we got. Feminism and egalitarianism destroys society. Traditionalism upholds the family unit. How should we deal with women in the future? I don't know of any other option besides the traditional patriarchal standard unless you have a better option.	28
0	Well I don't know where else to put women besides concentration camps.	28
0	At work with everyone else.	28
0	Hell no. Women lower productivity dramatically and lower the wages of men. The job market would be much more stable with the absence of women.	28
0	This probably coming from a really sour individual or one who just hasn't been in a relationship.  And South Park seemed to be making fun of that idea.	28
0	Why is it then that the integrated units of the YPG/YPJ in syria is winning the war against ISIS: http://en.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu13QLw2qdI  Likewise all the factual reports on Syria so far indicates their advancement.	28
0	I don't like the word 'allowed' here. because if someone is 'alllowing' us to have some 'power' it means that it's dependable on them.	28
0	What is Blue Pill?   It is putting other peoples' interests ahead of your own.    In the short term, everyone needs to care about the planet. But after we're gone ... that's a Blue Pill worry.	28

0	/u/samirahmad2594 Arranged marriage bad? Low divorce rate and shit xD Arranged marriage is the best marriage aka poison. Female are incapable of loving male anyways :P	28
0	&gt; Dump people produce way more children than smart ones, so the gene pool is becoming dumber and dumber with every generation. Ever see Idiocracy? That's a solid predictor of the future IMO.   It takes a real fucking idiot to say this.	28
0	Where is the part related to MGTOW?	28
0	That's why I think arranged marriage is the best form of marriage aka poison	28
0	Like the Japanese male herbivores, I think this is the women's side. Wanting to just let go and eat all the cake they want and still say they're a model. So kind of like 'fucked in the head' syndrome.	28
0	They should change it to "Fuck her right in the butt." I'd say "ass" but I think it's a little passé. Either is fine though.	28
0	If your mum is sociopathic then I think the beating is necessary to keep her in check	28

0	Galt is acknowledged to be a philosopher and inventor; he believes in the power and glory of the human mind, and the right of the individual to use his/her mind solely for him/herself. He serves as a highly individualist counterpoint to the collectivist social and economic structure	28
0	Thats some low quality Bait M8t If you MRA guys want to troll people on the mgtow forum you need to do better. Not saying we cant be trolled, we most certainly can be but the regular tactics dont work on us you need to be more creative.	28
0	Not trolling. If ya gonna hate, don't be ignorant about it. Not you, anyone. MRA does it too.	28
0	Is not ironic, it's societal norms that changed. They were the same evil creatures before, but had no advantage by showing their true form.	28
0	&gt;Nailed it.   Thank you for your substantial contribution to the conversation, OP.	28
0	Wow great comment. Well spoken!	28
0	You can't seem to look past your own experiences. If you really think that all women are like that, you REALLY need to reevaluate and quit being so sour.	28
0	They aren't. To those who exist in this crazy thing called "reality," it's pretty obvious that you're either completely bitter about some past experience of yours, or just insane.	28
0	Watch the Theory of Everything and then read up on Hawking's life for an example.	28

0	Well, US is a developing country in my books. Nothing bad, but have to go to real low GDP place to get worse employee protection than US.   Smell like HR department harping. Bet the line manager is really happy is this guy has any solid responsibilities.	28
0	Do you REALLY need me to explain this to you!? What the hell is wrong with you?	28
0	i'd make a funny here but i might get banished from the might MGTOW echo chamber.	28
0	We don't ban. We don't care what you think enough to do so.	28
0	yea, gurl, you don't need nobody *three snaps*	28
0	Nah, i thought about it once but it just didn't appeal to me. It's mostly me just having a boring/easy job.	28
0	And you are...   no one in particular.	28
0	this attitude will certainly set you apart from TRP	28
0	don't tease me with such a dream. i occasionally have to make sure the power plant isn't melting down.	28
0	true, i would have plenty of free time with the bonus of being the world's biggest welfare recipient	28
0	In other words, you'd be just like any other woman.	28
0	Are you sure you're not a redpiller? the vitriol is very similar.	28
0	Are you sure you're not a feminist?   Your logic is similar.	28
0	yea i fuckin love women haha	28
0	I wonder what it's like thinking a whole gender is so evil and sneaky. Men aren't evil or sneaky at all!	28
0	I hope that blonde reporter gets mugged one day while men in her vicinity just watch. THAT would be revenge.	28
0	bahaha yes, there are only two paths to take: yours, where you hate women and the other is praising them to no end. Seriously, get over to the RedPill, it'll feel like home. Oh, and you gotta love yourself before you can love anyone else. Get help.  But hey, this has been a fun convo between the spoiled and the deprived. Peace out, hope you find something that makes you less bitter.	28
0	I am a bit dissapointed by the answer.  There are bigger things in life, not only male-female interactions. I asked the question as a more general one and the topic was female role models, instead I just got the phylosophy of the movement, which is offtopic and doesnt concern the question.	28
0	bahaha no i am quite male. God's second mistake? You would prefer not existing? This is why prostitution should be legal, because when a guy doesn't get his knob polished for a long time he turns into a raving lunatic who blames a group of people for his personal problems. Tagged as The Adolf of Women.	28
0	yea, man, mutual respect is for pussies	28
0	bahahahah wtf? i'm sorry you have such a warped view on life. Did you have a shitty or non-existent relationship with your mother? I'd bet so. Some people get zero attention from women and they go crazy apparently. See you in the news, Elliot Rodgers.	28
0	well that's just sad. Even though you like and find pride in your seclusion, i hope you find someone to connect to, male or female.	28
0	Thats quite a wild and wrong assumption.  Anyway I have given up on the idea that you have any wisdom to share. All I see is cynism and paranoia. Seriously chill out.	28
0	Yes im sure your internet friends will provide warm companionship through a cold computer screen. poor unwanted guy.	28
0	im surprised your butt gets hurt so easily, since you prefer to surround yourself with men.	28
0	so this is the reaction to a life of rejection. so sorry for your luck, have fun getting your D dubbed by a bunch of bitter dudes. Be less of a shitty person and you may find people actually want to be around you. It feels good to be happy when some people are so purposefully miserable. Next chick I bang is for you, bro.	28
0	It's ok, I'm just a gay feminist who may potentially rape somebody.   I like how you can't keep your story straight. Suddenly you're a ladies man yeah? Hahaha	28
0	This was really cathartic to read, honestly.	28
0	Damn man. Generation wuss basically describes me and my peers, sadly.	28
0	Depends on how well information is shielded by the company and your own actions. In this case an address was needed as well and only HR will have that on me.	28
0	this just in: women like to be catty bitches to each other and there's no limit as to where that takes them. No limits.  A man needs useful input from the entire planet.	28
0	IT'S LEGAL. I can get one legally RIGHT NOW.  I do write carefully enough: as it's always been, you pay for TIME and no crime is committed by this act. A consenting adult couple alone together may, if they want, do what they want, including sex, and that's legal. That's also prostitution.	28
0	It is, as I claim	28
0	Doesn't matter. Iegal to pay for time, legal to have consenting sex. Period.	28
0	That makes you the fool.  It was my JOB to be an escort driver. My JOB. Not yours.	28
0	You're an idiot. Discussion is closed when **I** say so.	28
0	Closed only when I say so.  MEN make and break society and today men HANDED OVER the power to women so it's still the men who broke it - by using laws to give women privilege they didn't earn and had no idea how to use in a way that is healthy for society.  You are a deeply fucked up idiot that needs to properly research history. Try again.	28
0	They really do.  If you're inept then they get up when you don't catch them and walk away, sometimes confused.	28
0	One more thing. If you are hell bent on having a family, you're going to have to move. As it stands now, asian women in the east are the last feminine and traditional women that have some modicum of respect for men. Women are women worldwide and I am a firm believer in AWALT, but these women are closer to the fifties paradigm that everyone defaults to. I would personally recommend surrogacy or adoption of you can. Find a woman from a country and culture that has a stigma against divorce and laws against it too.	28
0	Is every adjective suddenly offensive? You made wild assumptions about my personal life, which I know are not true  ` If i had to guess this woman is tired of the CC and she is hunting for eligible bachelors. The only ones around her are the mgtows (because they haven't been robed, raped and drained of their soul yet)` because Im in a satisfying 4 year relationship and we are very much in love, thank you very much. I could not give a fuck about finding eligible bachelors.  Im just curious and thought you might have something interesting to share.	28
0	That is not really important if Mother Teresas order gave back the donations to the Vatican (cuz the church really needs money) and didnt even provide basic medical help to the people they were supposedly helping, they just provided them with a place to die	28
0	You sound like an agent provocateur.	28
0	lol could you sound any more insecure?  Jesus christ you are a walking example of how "just dealing with computers" penalises you in other areas.  that area in this instance is your obvious insecurity, and hence im sure in the real world you are a "shrinking violet" who is intimidated by average people in normal scenes , because it hits your insecurity.  fucking pathetic.	28
0	its funny that you think thats an insult and that you are undermining me, you are very much like a leper trying to humiliate me for "not having leprosy."  oh the shame i feel, its unbearable lol, enjoy your leper colony princess ill be crying myself to sleep nightly.	28
0	Who needs rrreasons when you've got heeeroin?	28
0	You know what you sound like to me?   A little chicken.   Ba bock bock bock   Ba bock bock bock  Ba bock bock bukka bukka bock bock bock!	28
0	&gt; you seem to be under some illusion that i have a need to prove something to you, as i stated i dont give a shit how you live your life or what you do, i find comedy in the car crash that is your existence.	28
0	Lmao. That's one way of looking at it. A very very sad way.	28
0	Yes, we're on such a level platform of ideas here. You don't have the evidence to back up your claims, and it's obvious from where you gather your warrants.	28
0	Those are very specific items which use a tiny, tiny percent of the tax money being collected. Saying we want as close to zero tax as possible is saying we're against all the other 99.9% of the things that tax money goes to pay for, and that has nothing to do with MGTOW.	28
0	OK, I'll be more general. Who relies more on healthcare? Women (more services, longer life, more frequent checkups/surgeries etc). Who earns more in general, and therefore has to pay more taxes? Us, men. Even if you stay single all your life you'll pay in taxes for others' welfare and healthcare.  Also, related thread on TRP [archived](https://archive.is/8vroR).	28
0	lol, ill save you some time princess, your faulty logic has no value or impact here, as i can simply reply using your own incompetent line of reasoning.  "why do you feel this constant need to seek validation from me?"	28
0	MGTOW is interesting, but it is still grounded in complaining about females. complaining means playing the victim, and giving up your power. It seems like a lot of work and energy spent trying to change other people and get sympathy.	28
0	yet if you put faith in upvotes and downvote ratios being a reflection of the community then MGTOW is equally retarded in this case, just look at the scores yourself, this insecure bigot with a huge inferiority complex has the consensus of the group.  That speaks volumes to some.	28
0	exactly my point... but i got downvoted because I called out the way this sub is and hit a nerve with the more blue pill dynamic that is currently r/MGTOW	28
0	&gt; fried ice  Hm. Only knew about "square ball". I like yours better.	28
0	Have you watched Road Warrior?	28
0	&gt;Gay/straight = the same result  GTFO already, troll.	28
0	im not angry, and this is just  constructive criticism that's all. you interpret it as anger and shaming because you dont understand why anyone would say what i said and be critical of r/mgtow in this way.  its very simple.. what you focus on is where you energy goes. if you focus on women, even if its just to hate on them, you arent focused on improving your self.  hatred and self righteousness are a major theme here. i'm Speaking up about it because its the right thing to do.	28
0	i do it because im androcentric and see the gynocentric behavioral issues here as hurting lots of men, so I speak up about it.	28
0	Yeah because enforced segregation sounds like a totally awesome idea. Please. It's just you jerking it onto your keyboard.	28
0	thank you for speaking up, I see lots of trolls here every time i post to this sub... Its nice to see another man who gets the point.	28
0	of course this is logical and part of being a man. Im merely trying to raise awareness on the facts of what some of the more negatively fixated members of r/mgtow are doing and how that hurts the community and new comers.	28
0	im not angry at all, so what makes you think i am?	28
0	the best thing you can do for you, is just accept that it is the way it is, and then focus on improving your life and making your self happy.  when you are wrapped up in the absurdity of it, that will stop you from doing what needs to be done because you are still focusing on women.	28
0	Sorry, you are correct. I did not read enough and don't understand the science as well as you do.	28
0	You, uh... you know who Bundy was, right?	28
0	since you are trolling here is another comparison.  men being focused on women and what women do wrong... is the same as feeding a troll. the men are just playing into the womens game by being reactionary when they are focused on women. they aren't focused on chasing women they are focused on judging women... its still gynocentric focus.	28
0	Best action movie in many years and all the butthurt faggots crying about nothing just made it even more fun. Men going their own way should have no reason to be upset about women not wanting to be slaves. It just makes you sound like bitter shitheads looking for anything to lambast. There are better battles to fight.	28
0	Your arguments can't be backed up at all, at least not sufficiently.   And why do you assume that I'm a woman? and why do you use such gender based lines to insult me? You're not helping that whole "misogyny" thing that your group is accused of.	28
0	are you willing to trade one gynocentric focus... of chasing women, for a new one of judging women...  essentially you can choose to work on your self where you can actually make improvements, or complain about women when they don't give a fuck and wont change for you.  I know which one I would do... sorry if you think this is heartless, I feel like this comes from the heart.	28
0	its really weird how people here interpret what i say.  they say im angry at /r/mgtow when im not, they say im heartless when this comes from the heart.   when asked why they think im angry they refuse to answer.   its almost as if the movements been co-opted and turned into a mirror image of feminism.	28
0	im not saying dont talk about them, im saying that the way people wallow in anger about women on this sub is not healthy for them and is gynocentric.	28
0	Build a major car company, become a billionaire, changpe the ways of transportation, have houses everywhere, be as healthy as can be, relax, and live.	28
0	that's when /r/theRedPill comes to the rescue	28
0	not angry at all, so for some reason you think i am... i wonder why that is?	28
0	I don't believe i'm chastising too harshly, but you do bring up some good points. I think as an initial exposure, you need to include ideas like I am talking about in some amount...  I posted this and it initially got some down-votes then went positive then more of the more hateful and immature comments started showing up. Its clear that /r/mgtow would like to agree with me but there is a large portion that is simply just here to push the lowest common denominator of expressing negative emotions to blow off steam.	28
0	/r/mgtow isn't marching, its sitting in the corner banging on the drum as hard as it can hoping to accomplish something. Its pathetic.	28
0	&gt; 'm not saying you're guranteed to get STDs, you're not, but there is always a risk.  --  &gt;i will just go somewhere where prostitution is legal and then handle my problem  Wat.	28

Man, take a while away from the computer for your wife, kid, very heterosexual missionary porn,  country music or Fox news. You are upset about everything!	28

0	Are you fucking retarded?	28
0	Leave me alone you spineless guttersnipe	28
0	Very cowardly philosophy I must say.	28
0	Such biting wit, I expected no more from such a degenerate.	28
0	I have to say, I'm not really even against this hiring of women into positions in academia because they are teachers and role models, and I think having a diverse staff helps encourage people from all walks of life pursue STEM degrees. Just because women are hired at a 2:1 ratio doesn't mean that there are currently 2:1 women being hired. It's still overwhelmingly male.   I just wish feminists would drop their victim complex and have a rational discussion instead of defaulting to woe is me narratives whenever possible.	28
0	Women refuse to grow up and that's why they are mad when they don't get their princess-theme birthday celebrations!    But they tell the men who have wisely avoid them to "grow up"?  No, you grow up you bunch of princess wanna-bes!	28

0	Because white men dominate STEM professorships at universities across America. I don't think you get what I'm saying.	28
0	But the study says there is a 2:1 bias among equally qualified candidates	28
0	I agree wholeheartedly and if anything I said was taken as contradictory, I retract it and replace it with what this guy said.    MGTOW doesn't have to mean celibacy or antipathy towards women, just the freedom from feeling compelled to partner up because it's what you're "supposed to do".  Men AND women can each live perfectly fulfilling lives without a SO.	28

0	Nothing wrong with some sampling, as long as you buy what you like.	28
0	Going MGTOW is a step some take, usually after going through all TRP phases, so just chill out, go study TRP, and then make your decisions.  Also, learn how to use punctuation.	28
0	You had three paragraphs....	28
0	Well put sir. I like this sub but there's alot of 'yeah, women are evil amirite' to it. You can feel the angry typing of a dudes broken heart and empty bank.  But the cool calm and collected mgtow are badass.  I like this sub. And to prove it, I'm unsubscribing. All the best fellas.	28
0	I am not insulting people for having a different outlook or opinion; I am insulting people who cannot communicate in a clear, concise manner.    Heck, I wouldn't even mind if every post was another guy telling his sob story so long as he respected the English language and explained what drove him to his epiphany. What I cannot stomach in ANY thread are people who post textwalls that are so poorly proofread as to be nigh illegible.    Make your point and share your grief if you so desire, gents - just do so in a manner that doesn't come across like the Facebook wailings of women scorned.	28
0	Good point. I must have misunderstood the point you were trying to make.	28
0	Your mom would agree if not for my cock in her mouth.	28
0	&gt; Also your statement was 90% fluff with little substance, I still don't know what your stance is other than "that guy is an idiot"  Junior, I'm not sure you really know what "substance" is.  Hint: it *isn't* just piles and piles of evo-psych-babble "just so stories" from TRP-land.	28

0	Did someone mention sloths?  Here's a random fact!  It typically takes about a month for a sloth to move one kilometre.	28
0	Nah. I'm cool with people ranting. It eventually goes away. As someone who mentioned before, this is probably one of the few places where he can speak his mind. Anyplace else people won't take them seriously. I would always prefer that to "imagine ourselves as well-mannered gentlemen in sportcoats conversing over a glass of scotch", a place where people compete who has the bigger dick, who is the manlier, etc.	28
0	Venting is fine and healthy; all I hope is MGTOWs who feel the need at least do so like someone who passed 8th grade.  You're typing here, not talking... take a few minutes to read your post and see if it says something insightful to share rather than just "I'm all fucked up".    We're here for you bros, but let's talk man to man instead of like wailing pubescents.	28
0	Maybe we need a "MGTOW-the old farts" sub!	28
0	The Women's studies department should have more men? IS there a demand or push for men to go into Women's Studies? No. But there is one for women, and the more proper role models women have in STEM fields, the more that will move in.	28
0	Quoting Hillary Clinton?  Hahahahaahahahahahaha (genuine laugh, I was laughing) where?  I'm done with you man, you're either an idiot or a troll. Either way, grow up and fuck off man, MGTOW is supposed to be a forum of reasonable people who see past bullshit, not the people who throw it around as slander.	28
0	Yeah, but it would still be funny. Plus she would lose her carefully cultivated "Internet identity".	28
0	OP, this is your opportunity to turn your "stalker", into a "groupie". Rock her world... Just be sure to have all your bases covered when the false accusations start flying...	28
0	How many people over the Internet have you met having not said a word to them in private? Or better yet, how many people that you **don't like** have you offered to meet before **you've even had a conversation with them**?   I think you've had a response like this canned and in waiting but have used it an an inopportune time making yourself look dumber than the statement itself.	28
0	Lol. I am not putting my dick in a Toronto feminist even if I could afford the required penicillin!	28
0	Lol I already know the answer to that but I'll try.	28
0	&gt; Your anger, vitriol and general rude way of debating  Yawn... the little whiny "bitch" tactics don't work on me, never did, never will.  I'm not angry, there's no vitriol, and I haven't been "debating" you.	28
0	Except this one has a sizable comment history with a 7000+ karma.	28
0	She seems creepily obsessed with you.  I'm guessing she wants to fuck you.  Literally or metaphorically, I can't tell. But she definitely wants to fuck you.	28
0	She definitely wants to screw me over and not in a good way. She has no idea what I look like. Lol nice name by the way!	28
0	I mean daisy fresh to me. :D   This is all new.	28
0	She responded to my post about women being public vehicles claiming the highly original female diagnoses of "bitterness". I took it from there but her being an entitled, 20-something, white bitch from Toronto, she claims she's "never met someone who hated me because of my gender" which really means she's never met a male who treated her or any women other than a princess. That's understandable given Toronto's sizable mangina population.   Have a look at thebluepill anyway just for the fun of seeing such a pitiful collective of women pretending to be NAWALTs.	28
0	Aww, come on man! "you should be glad to have gotten molested".  Hehe nice story.	28
0	I just had an evil thought. Funny as all get-out too. But--- nope, I ain't agonna doit.  But, for those who have no qualms about such things--- there ARE text-wall rant generators out there--- and this thread is just asking for it.	28
0	Yes, and yet women seem to be sort of missing the satire.  Like A) they like thinking about acting that way and at the same B) like to think they're in on the joke making fun of all those other girls.  The doublethink is kind of mind-bending.	28
0	Quick question: Do you have a point?	28
0	Have you copied this to the rest of the supposedly "irrelevant" posts here or just mine?   You need to spend more time bettering yourself and less time worrying about my posts.	28
0	Best line regarding it.   "it interferes with my mental abilities"  "so does a bullet through the head"	28
0	Intellectual laziness I think.   What other generation would you find such concepts as "wall of text" and "tl;dr"?  I bet today's generation thinks the Dewey Decimal System is a heavy metal band.	28
0	Yea that made me laugh. That movie really got a lot right about Dredd	28
0	how is it hilarious? I am asking questions that I wan to know the answer to. I don't understand you guys, but I want to. Instead of laughing at me, please help me out.	28
0	Hey be nice. Who cares if I can't spell well.	28
0	What does LTR mean?	28
0	Why do you say shackled? Men and women need each other. That is not being shackled, that is called love.	28
0	Maybe you just haven't found the right woman.	28
0	Maybe your standards are too high?	28
0	What is wrong with a man taking care of the person he loves? Is MGTOW love not care about loved ones? I'm confused.	28
0	Are you guys open to STL than?	28
0	What does this have to do with my questions?	28
0	It's not because he is male. It is because this is what I want, and a marriage is about everyone getting what they want.	28
0	I'm sitting here in my chair, so I most exist.	28
0	Hi master jack   I wanna fuck you like an animal   Right in your pungent bunghole!   And you'll love it!	28
0	&gt; You don't have the balls to turn down pussy  You're saying this as if it's a good thing to reject normal social interaction. I sure don't "have the balls" to do it.  I hope you have the balls one day to sit in a room in solitary confinement, forgoing all friends and discussion!	28
0	I do not live in US. I pay far less for a monthly deal. There are many other advantages I also see, but it is far off topic.	28
0	I love it when you talk dirty.   Hurt me baby!	28
0	Ummm   Are you two like boyfriend and girlfriend?   Loverrrrrs?   Come on, level with me sporto, you slip masterjack the hot beef injection?	28
0	You sound like a broken person. I truly hope you find help soon.	28
0	And this is why I reject my position as a man in society, and why I am going off to find what's right for me.  Fuck marriage :)  Edit: GODDAMNIT, I thought this thread wasn't in /r/mgtow!  You restored my faith in humanity for a moment!	28
0	Hahahahaha   It was only a matter of time before you made trophies out of women you old objectifier you.   Winning!	28
0	Don't you wish you had the slightest bit of power to stop thinking about me for one second?   I mean 7 username mentions in 2 minutes! You need a boyfriend, baaaaaaaad.	28
0	Hell, why stop with female permission? Let's just throw all socializing out the window. Be your own man! No need for human permission.	28
0	And you were sitting there hitting refresh and examined it with a fine tooth comb to notice!   You need a boyfriend.	28
0	Why do you think women are "born evil"? Do you think there's a "God" that made us this way or what?	28
0	What exactly is evil about wanting to survive? If you truly believe this is the nature of woman and she doesn't know any other way to survive, how is it evil? How do you define evil?	28
0	Bahahaha   You talk as if you won't be back!	28
0	Yeah, that's what i noticed! Why are there fucking bitch's trolling on here, they need to go and fuck off!	28
0	Who said I cared?	28
0	How do you define evil?	28
0	Women alway's have questions, but they never have the answer!                                                                                       - Some cool mother fucker	28
0	Sexual companionship goes beyond the sex of the people involved. Why do you focus on vagina? Men having sex with men, when they have that urge, is just as important and fulfilling as men having sex with women. It's normal social interaction.	28
0	You asked a bunch of loaded questions.	28
0	my view is that that prostitution is wrong wholly.  women in prostitution are rarely not abused by pimp or john. mgtow is about avoiding being hurt by women.  applauding the sexual exploitation of women should not be the sentiment.  this should be a community of men who go there own way, not a red pill type thing.  women should be happy, so should us.  I am much happier living a solitary life!!  I dont want to enable a women with fantasies of controlling me and disposing of me if I become a burden.  I have simply given up on women and most men tbh.	28
0	Sweet little MRAs, how cute.	28
0	Who cares if they are abused? You don't hear about women refusing to pursue men that have been divorce raped, do you? Instead we hear cries to "man up".  Her body, her choice.   My money, my choice.	28
0	&gt; born evil  Is a tiger evil?  It chases down its prey and murders it by biting its neck.  But that's just how tigers evolved and are born.  They are animals and don't think.  Women aren't much different.  Like tigers they are beautiful creatures and should not be hated - but avoid them for your own personal safety.	28
0	a simple bureaucratic screwup?! oh my god! Since when does the middle class have to deal with this! I thought it was only for those filthy poors. This is *cleary* misandries.	28
0	&gt; beta males  lol you literally think of people in terms of 19th century zoology.  so if guys who get laid are betas and alphas, does that make you an omega?  &gt;While alphas and MGTOW enjoy their lives.   you sound bitter. I also think it's funny that you liken yourself to an "alpha."	28
0	You sound like Fox News. Are all mgtows this crazy-far-right?	28
0	No, that's not what they teach. They teach that there's a plurality of definitions for racism/sexism/etc. and that among them is the idea that those within a space of privilege, intersectionally, cannot really be made the subject of effective hate. Intersectionality is important here because you can be white and poor and actually be worse off than a rich black person.  Regardless, she was being sarcastic, and it's obvious. You people are hysterical.	28
0	Pretty sure the UN doesn't call a social democratic nation whose economy is clearly capitalist "socialist."  Also pretty sure they aren't hysterical and acting like it's [white genocide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zMzeKBEvaQ) because Muslims are immigrating.	28
0	Your the true alpha!  Your my hero!  Look me up on PoF, eHarmony, Match.com and Tinder.	28
0	lol wow. did i hit a little too close to home? y'all are such sensitive babies.	28
0	lol wow.   i wonder what your life is like. you're so bitter and obviously very depressed. i feel bad for you.	28
0	Raaaaaaaaaape! Some unattractive guy looked me in the eye!   Ahahahahahahah women are soooooooooo sttoooooopidddd	28
0	I've been reading the article and comments.  Having trouble making up my mind.    On one hand Mike brings up some good points about men being disadvantaged in family court and education.  And of course there is the hypocrisy of our circumcision and domestic violence policies.   On the other side of the argument, he has a small penis and bad hair.  I mean, come on. This guy probably doesn't even get laid very much.  Do we really want guys like that making our laws?	28
0	Nikola Tesla is a millionaire now by making and selling that electric car.  Pretty sure he gets his pick of women.	28
0	&gt; Uh, okay. You just restated what I already said.  learn to read. goddamn, that hysteria is making you cray.  &gt;to know both what was taught at my college this year  I have no idea what's taught at buttfuck community. I went to grad school and know what was taught there.  &gt;as well as that this woman was being sarcastic.  because I'm not literally retarded and am capable of grasping obvious irony.	28
0	&gt; Fags like you are so bitter and obviously very depressed.  lol wow  you are an endless cornucopia of lols. I'm bitter because I have normal, healthy relationships and you're not, even though you're lashing out and throwing a tantrum?  I could help you out, but you're obviously too far gone, closed up in your little fantasy land, afraid of women.	28
0	&gt; you are a fucking idiot  lol says the mgtow   seriously, mgtows are like among the dumbest people on the face of the planet. do you even *read* this forum? look at it. it's like a bunch of beetle-browed, blithering village idiots got together and formed a sub around their collective fear of women.  I'll be over here with my grad degree and my successful relationships and my total lack of neuroses if you want to talk. I could help you out, you know. That is, if you aren't afraid to admit literally all of the problems that led you to become mgtow are your fault.	28
0	lol you're one hot mess. never change, baby. never change.  or do if you ever want to be a functioning person who isn't completely loathed by everyone he knows. either way, I'm getting a kick out of this shit. I mean, you literally believe this glib, anti-intellectual horseshit with every fiber of your little self. It's kind of cute in a really warped way.	28
0	did you guys even bother to check her update? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOnEn1UNngE	28
0	&gt;I'm rubber and you're glue  Uh, ok? Bitter about what? Not being a virgin? Not being rejected constantly by women because of a shitty, worthless personality? Not blaming my failures on literally everyone else but myself?  Your entire ideology is an attempt to rationalize your bitterness. The fucked up thing is that you know it, deep down. You just can't admit it to yourself because you're afraid.	28
0	yeah, just like manginas	28
0	Doesn't have to be to woman or anyone. Could be through arts. Writing prose/poetry, drawing/painting, music, dancing... Hell, just acknowledge your emotions might be enough. Yes, this includes falling in love for a woman that you know from the first minute she was worthless.	28
0	lol, you can only repeat yourself because deep down you know I'm right and you can't figure out what else to say. If there were something you would have said it. Your troll game is weak.   I could have helped you, but I guess you'd rather wallow in self pity and bitter loneliness forever. Some life.  &gt;Your life is boring.  Nah, my life is insane. It's the antithesis of boring. Yours is spent alone and unloved, obsessing over sour grapes.  Stop projecting and nut up.	28
0	says the true forced loneliness loser who literally gave up trying to get laid lol	28
0	It's not a coincidence that you can't take criticism and also want to withdraw from a huge subset of social interaction + society.	28
0	fyi... women have quite a few scientific/engineering accomplishments. it hurts your over all point to throw in shit like that, but then again you seem to fight for defining us as superior not equal so i'm not sure why i'm surprised.. here is just a few mostly recent ones.   Stephanie Kwolek - kevlar    Ann Tsukamoto - stemcell isolation  Marie Curie’s - discovery of radium and polonium  Erna Schneider Hoover - automatic telephone switch   Grace Murray: computer code compiler and COBOL  Margaret Knight: square paper bags and many industrial patents.   Tabitha Babbitt: circular saw  Katherine Blodgett: non reflective glass  Elizabeth Lee Hazen and Rachel Fuller -  Nystatin antifungal  Mary Anderson - windsheild wiper	28
0	&gt; While the woman's resource seeking is a driven ambition to improve personal situation at the expense of others.  What do women want? Better.    ( I used to think it was "The upper hand", but I think "Better" is more relevant. )	28
0	LOL serves those pathetic beta boys right. Female worshippers deserve to get fucked over.   I don't blame the women too much because their maximum potential is to be cum dumpsters.	28
0	Isn't this taking MGTOW a bit too far? It's not a religion, you know.	28
0	How did you thread your projector so quickly?	28
0	MGTOW is not that all-encompassing that it starts to change your tastes regarding culture. At least, it shouldn't be.	28
0	You think about me a lot.   I'll go out with you then but only on one condition.   You were those bearskin tights I love, cowboy.    #eyehaytewymyn	28
0	A character has never been relatable for me so I learned to not care. All decisions main characters make were at some point completely unrelatable.	28
0	But then so many art forms will interest you that asking the question is pretty pointless. It would be better to exclude books and movies based on what you don't like than to look for things by MGTOW qualities.	28
0	&gt;Is it possible for women to change their behavior as described by MGTOW? If so, what would need to change?  The guys who subscribe to this immature philosophy would need to grow up and stop acting like bitter butthurt nerds who don't get any attention from women. *BUT*, it is easier to blame every single woman on the planet for their problems. Because blaming billions of people is easier than looking in the mirror and being honest with yourself.  You want advice? Don't listen to anything these failures have to say.	28
0	Ahahahahaha   Pot meet kettle.   Well my my your post sounds a bit like whining to me. For a lady killer like yourself you sure have a lot of free time on your hands.   Go lift.   And this ain't your house, little girl.  Start your own sub and shut the fuck up, SIMP.	28
0	I'm not offended. I find it part of the questionable direction that MGTOW is going in.	28
0	Good work Watson!   Wahhhhh wahhhhhh wahhhhhh   Added you to my stable of stalkers.   Go lift.   We got a date tonight and I love it when you come home all sweaty and masculine.	28
0	You mean to tell me you took the amount of time to do that? I'm flattered.   You're just full of energy today, that will serve me well when you serve me your cock tonight.  I want you to take out all that barbaric obsession in my ass, baby.  I hope you're Scottish cause we can do with a couple rounds of "caber tossing"!	28
0	Don't even feed this female worshipping, one blowjob away motherfucker, too scared to offend any possible lurkers that may have a vagina.   Laugh at him and bait him and he'll go away.	28
0	Well--- we seem to have a mutual "enemy" at any rate. I'm not sure I would apply the "stalker" label to you at least yet--- if you HAD actually tried that stunt you'd realize just how off the charge that we're the same person really is. Sorta like saying that MGTOW is organized, when it becomes apparent-- by anybody who actually looks--- that MGTOW is just the modern name for "confirmed bachelors" amongts other things.	28
0	You caught me, bro.   I'm every woman, it's all in meeeeee   Anything you want done, baby, I'll do it naturally!	28
0	You're so bitter.   Go lift.	28
0	And you're a woman.	28
0	I'm mad.   Mad about you, baby.   In fact, I'm mad as hell.   But you're gonna take it some more... tonight!	28
0	this subreddit was for actual discussion of why "women behave the way they do in Western culture"  That would be /r/TheRedPill	28
0	You belong in RedPill with that attitude, mister.	28
0	Now you're talking!   Smack that beyatch!   I am going to do the same thing to you but instead of my fist, I shall be using my cock. And instead of your mouth, I shall do it to your lower intestine.	28
0	I'll have to leave them to fight it out between them for awhile. Gotta switch out. My cleverly crafted disguise as pirate6728 changes to--- EXPEDITED MAN, able to move two-thousand-pound loads of freight from O'Hare Airport to Waterloo, Iowa in mere hours.	28
0	Boy this thread turned juvenile right quick.	28
0	there are some good posts on this subreddit (yours is not one of them unfortunately)  A lot of good advice/info/experiences related here if you are willing to look for it.  I'm 56 and can well understand the angry posts by the younger guys and the damaged (divorced) guys.  So what???   venting/healing has to be expected in a place like this.  I like to find posts by User-31f--- and Musclecarz among others.  They have some good insights and a way of putting their thoughts down in writing that I can only wish I could do.   A tremendous resource for younger men looking for insight	28
0	I smell a woman under this text	28
0	To be fair, she was a fiancé, meaning he had already asked her to marry him. The big guy (nick, I think) did it to himself, the divorce rape train cut its brake lines when he got engaged. That being said, I personally think this video was funny.	28
0	1) only a tiny percent of the population in general has those awards so it's not compelling evidence.  2)it's my understanding that it wasn't until around the start of the award that women couldn't even legal hold patents.  if they had little to gain by trying to invent and a culture that looked down on them being in those fields it could account for a large part of the difference. 3) women face lower risk of homelessness,  if they look even mediocre they can usualy find a place to live... again less incentive to try	28
0	Socializing is important. If you are alone for too long you'll become a weirdo or develop depression. If have seen this happen to people. I don't know you but I think it's more likely that you just haven't found the right people to socialize with than that you are a hermit. Try to expand the circle of people you know. Go out of your comfort zone.	28
0	Learn to code or cs related stuff then start a business	28
0	Excellent point. He's not the easiest kid to talk to, very quiet and introverted... basically he's an awkward teen (yeah, I just made an excuse). His dykier mom says he wants a male influence, and wants to learn man skills, like vehicle maintenance, but he has never said anything of the sort directly to me. That's all I really know about what he wants.	28
0	&gt; You're liking your own posts with a ringer to make yourself look like the supported party.   A "ringer"?  ROTFLMAO.  This account has been around for 2 years, and probably a dozen people have "friended" me... I also don't give a single squat shit about the "karma" votes.  But apparently you do... and you think this is some attention-voting-support "game" (just like you think you're being "debated" -- which you're not).  ---  You're really just a rather pointless little joke at this point in time; you're not fooling anyone.	28
0	Who says they're not? I don't see anything in the sidebar that says otherwise. Maybe it's certainly not mandatory, but how do you plan to achieve success of the stated goals by disregarding men's rights? No one said kissing anyone's ass, I said tolerate. If you can't do that then maybe part of the problem is with you. And I'm not too worried what someone thinks I should do when they have to use a throwaway account just to GTOW. Whatever buddy.	28
0	If I didn't read the sidebar how could I say what was in it? I think it's fairly clear what it's about. Improving things for men. How do you plan to do that? I'd like to hear it. So you are throwing around insults and using the throwaway, I'm completely calm and trying to improve the culture and I'm the troll? Your coming across a bit bitter and angry mate. Gotta tell you.	28
0	But... But... I don't eat meat!	28
0	artsy women? well maybe they should figure out they can save money by cutting on alcohol and weed ;))	28
0	I was reading about the ucsb shooter, heard about incels and pathetic women hating virgins like you here at MGTOW and decided to see just how fucked up and delusional you people really were. Let me tell you I was astounded. You're right about no woman ever wanting you, and you're right about no woman ever deserving you because no person deserves to be punished by being with such a disgustingly insane egomaniac freak. Holy shit am I glad it seems like most of you will never procreate.	28
0	Gay guys are like women, only more caty.	28
0	Be sure to tell your captors that. I'm sure they'll be happy to hear it.  You might--- just might-- want to pay attention next time in history class. See what REALLY happens in wars. Don't try to sell me the Leftist "all wars are capitalist gangster" crap until you DO really study history.	28
0	ROTFL that's awesome.	28
0	Yeah, that's true, but I don't think they can do much about their faces. Men's faces get more dignified with age. It's like years of wisdom shape it. Women just deteriorate and look decrepit.	28
0	Does crew count as a tom-boyish sport? Me thinks it does.	28
0	You must be a real hit with a hit with the ladies lol	28
0	There's no one to be fooled  Everything is a lie  The walls are moving  River trout are walking  The sand is crawling with aphids  Your move oh wise one.	28
0	I figured it out, hang out with fun men and women. Enjoy.  Who would you rather be around? The dude in the Youtube above or [the person in this Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s75L9Qxn8Ew)? The first one just seems depressed and like a buzz kill, the other can put a smile on my mouth and be part of a good time. On the one hand, I have a beautiful girl tell me how to shade a sphere, and on the other, I have a dude telling me how to deal with loneliness?	28
0	This comment needs its own thread.	28
0	&gt;anorexia are personal choices (yes anorexia is a choice, you can fucking choose to eat or not to eat  Man, you're an incredibly judgemental tool.  Like you have any fucking clue what it's like to be famous, rich, and in the spotlight.  Like you have any idea what it's like to live a life other than your own.  Cast that judgement, you, the wise one, you.  If only all could read your words, they would understand all they had to do was eat.  People like you are why we have difficulty moving forward.	28
0	What does being rich and famous have to do with anorexia? Plenty of poor and unknown people are anorexic as well. That doesn't change the fact that anorexia is a choice. It is caused by purposely not eating. If you purposely deprive yourself of food then obviously you will become ill. Not saying anorexic people don't need help, but its absolutely their fault.	28
0	&gt; I even got a nice taze for trying to tell my side of the story instead of immediately dropping to the ground with my hands behind my head.  Your police force is FUCKED UP for goodness' sake!	28
0	Yeh, they are quick to blast a guy.  Try looking at the laws on the book where you are.  I was flabbergasted that men here could be arrested merely on hearsay, because that is a major violation of the Constitution.  But I guess men lose their inalienable rights to "protect the women"	28
0	Found this browsing r/all and this is so offensive in so many ways. I asked my husband to marry me. We've been married for 20yrs and he is nowhere near the guy described in this post.  If you don't want to get that's your chose but don't go acting like women force guys to get married. If you can be pressured into changing something you deeply believe you need to reevaluate your life choices.	28
0	Read my comment before down voting.  Article is wrong. Flat out. Women don't ride off into the sunset after they divorce.  They become bitter, desperate, and lonely. In fact, the majority of women will regret their divorce.	28

0	He isn't on reddit. He isn't on any social media	28

0	Cool story dude. Nope not lost.	28
0	Fuck, you are all talking like feminists for me stating a FACT.  A trivially easy fact to look up.  Yet here you are asking for citations and getting on my shit for a fact.  http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/marriage-and-mens-health  I thought us MGTOW were supposed to value truth, no matter how uncomfortable, over fantasy.	28
0	These seem in conflict.  http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/marriage-and-mens-health  Not that I want a woman or anything.	28
0	Funny how you didn't write four paragraphs about the guy becoming a bald alcoholic who dies of an early heart attack.  &gt;not being agreed with  I stated a documented fact and made no opinion.   You lost your shit and became emotional because you thought I was making a pro argument for marriage.	28

0	"When you sense something isn't right, high-tail it out of dodge before the shit hits the fan." ... "Just think of what happened to that poor white/hispanic/jewish guy in Florida a few years back who defended himself from Trayvon the Ghetto Thug."  Um... you must not be familiar with the case.	28
0	Here comes the SJW with the same old *"Like you have any idea what it's like to live a life other than your own"* bullshit.   Do you need to be a serial killer to cast judgement on a serial killer? No bitch.   Do you need to be a child rapist to cast judgement on a child rapist? Nope!   Quit being a fucking PUSSY and making excuses for other pieces of shit like yourself. Anorexia is a personal choice, just like smoking meth, doing coke and having unprotected sex with homeless drug users. Grow the fuck up and learn about personal responsibility.	28
0	FYI, you can make money off discrimination case :P	28
0	Isn't it extreme to compare marriage with drinking 50 gallons of cyanide.	28
0	Wow, that was easy.	28
0	You know you're the fourth one to propose the "devil made her do it" excuse to me today alone?   Feminism *is* female nature. Female nature unrestrained destroys society. Female nature is inherently fucked up.   And talk to Tesla and he'll tell you how he couldn't build without the support of women.	28
0	I'd say there's correlation between mental illness and having a vagina ;)	28
0	Jesus.  Just like a feminist.	28
0	I think you have to get married or have kids before you end up paying alimony	28
0	&gt; I believe in AWALT      You clearly don't.	28
0	For the non-English speakers, "porta" is a reference to a porta potty; i.e. a cheap, plastic, shit-box. It's also a play on the Latin double-meaning of entrance or gate.	28
0	Ahh, yes, that fairy tale love, happily ever after... until he leaves her for another man.	28
0	Your friend is having a hard time coping with the death of someone he obviously cared deeply for (for his own reasons, which you need to respect, despite your stupid reasons to devalue  and disregard another human being), and you take this opportunity to shove your stupid reddit friendzone bullshit down his throat? God, I hope I never have a friend treat me like you did to yours if I come to them for support.	28
0	A lot of jews are riddled with genetic diseases. In breeding and unhealthy religious practices.   Mainly it's pay back from being excluded from roman civilization. The catapults were loaded with other things besides stones.	28
0	&gt; No, alas it isn't.  First time meeting a so-called "MGTOW" that isn't up to date on these things.  To be expected with the influx of incels and marriage strikers, I suppose...	28
0	Fuck off concerned troll. Just ask yourself this. If you needed help from a friend who are you more likely to ask? A man or a girl? I thought so.	28
0	Well, mgtow is not equal with monk mode or it is?	28
0	&gt; First time meeting a so-called "MGTOW" that isn't up to date on these things.  Gee first time in... less than the total of two weeks you've been here.  Amazing.  &gt; To be expected with the influx of incels and marriage strikers, I suppose...  LOL... "smack" from a newbie account that is what... 12 days old?  Junior... you're a frigging JOKE.	28
0	&gt; Now, to be clear, I don't give a rat's ass about society and women, nor do I care about the sexual marketplace   You had me fooled. Chill out dude. If you want to invent an artificial womb, that's awesome. Go do it. No need for an exasperated diatribe.	28
0	You should create a post with these and more details. I have one smaller experiment that I could post there as a reply.	28
0	&gt; If you smell like skunk, some chicks dont mind at all.  If you get stuck in a tight corner, burping and/or farting theatrically is worth a shot...	28
0	Point taken.   In practice, the strategy I prefer is simply blanking / ignoring them as far as possible. I don't care about their 'tinglz' at all so they can have them or not have them - I will be sure to disappoint them if they make themselves enough of an actual nuisance as to get in my face.	28
0	yes, you people are pathetic	28
0	Oh my god, it's as if someone has a type or something!   EDIT: Oh, downvotes? You guys are butthurt over the fact that i'm right. If you were a woman, if all other variables were held constant, would you want to date an attractive rich man, or an unattractive poor man?	28
0	You guys are the easiest to troll.	28
0	I see people having to much expectations on sexbots. It won't happen in our lifetime. We don't even have an appropriate male masturbator that do not need our hands to work. There is a few on the market, but it is clumsy, noisy, hard to keep clean, wear out fast, etc.   Fleshlight, realistic dolls, free abundant porn, yes. Sexbot, not in an hundred years yet.  Bring the downvotes.	28
0	Suggesting that someone gets 50-60% of all calories from fats, while also preaching 60-80 grams of protein per day is a recipe for failure. Double the protein, halve the fat and your suggestions wouldn't be that bad.	28
0	Hey I have another idea, how about rounding up people with inferior genetics? Oh wait, you already tried that.	28
0	this is a good post	28
0	Go to any Walmart in the USA, I'm sure you'll find many examples of how your diet is a failure.   Then go to most hardcore gyms in the USA, ask about the ripped guy's diets. They will always be high protein low fat/carb.	28
0	So... basically **junior** you ARE a "newbie" (certainly around here).  And furthermore, you seem to be a bit of a "trend-hopper" bouncing around from one fashionable meme to another... as well as engaging in all kinds of evo-psych babbling.  *quelle surprise*	28
0	If you and your brother have an hour and a half to watch the video, sit him down and watch this with him. I'm sure it would change his outlook on society. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mzYKWDx6YI	28
0	I'm a "trend-hopper" like someone that learns addition and subtraction before they learn multiplication and division.  But since you're doubling down on your denial of basic knowledge, I won't waste my time with you anymore.  Good luck on never figuring out why things work the way they do! 👌	28
0	Again... the more you go on... the more you prove what a *frigging* joke you are junior.	28
0	MGTOW is about quitting and no one likes a quitter.  We are losing battles in relationships, paternity, and our rights. MGTOW seems like a passive form of protest to me; though I do understand their frustration, I cannot co-sign on their solution	28
0	Yup. And I still plan to move to Asia once I hit financial independence.	28
0	At least the first four probably apply to the haters. They have a huge problem with their lives and rather than admit that it is intractable they must deny the evidence of their own lives. Especially they must deny anybody who challenges these big, expensive assumptions they ahve based their life plans on as that might mean they have to admit they are wrong.  Let's admit it. Some man living in a happy relationship with a loving partner, they do exist, wouldn't mind how we want to live our lives.	28
0	&gt; We're not actually happy, we're just pretending to be happy that we're MGTOW  I don't even pretend to be happy. Learn and accept about all these is not a pill easily swallowed at all. But then, it wouldn't be the first harsh true that I've learned about existence. The more I know about humans, the more I like my dog. To exist sucks and the sooner I accept it, the easier it gets. Call it "dark budhism" or something.  Now I survive through sarcasm and silly humor. That is how I manage my sanity.	28
0	&gt; Or maybe I just watch too many dystopian movies.  I get your feeling, but it might be more about this. Less people in the world would mean less economic output, something that not everyone might be ready to (try to spend a few weekends on smaller cities to better understand what I mean).	28
0	I'd like to see your scientific data backing up your claim.  My scientific data is my body. I have 17.5 inch arms, and I can bench 250+, deadlift 300+ and squat 300+ and I've lost 110 lbs of fat since I started lifting.  Go to any reputable body building website, ask any certified trainer, ask any bodybuilder, they will say the same things I'm saying. There's a reason why chicken is so popular with muscle heads, it's because it's low fat and high protein, meaning that you can get a lot of protein without exceeding a 2000-2500 calorie limit.	28

1	Lol. Ham remains deluded in thinking clothes can make her look good. Size 20 is well past that point. Nothing can hide your rolls and blobs and white only makes it worse.	30
1	That is the best description of a fatty imploding I have ever heard of, Neutron Star.  At least we will never have to worry about the fatty going Super Nova.	30
1	I think has more to do with him not showering for 5 days	30
1	More like Jurassic World just found their Thyroidasaurus Rex.....	30

1	"I mean.. what could I possibly do to be able to walk that much?"  "Maybe walk more often. You'll lose weight and increa-"  "Nah, how about I just complain some more, instead?"	30
1	Humans aren't biologically wired to detect the actual age of other humans, they're wired to detect health, and thus closeness to death. What you're perceiving as premature ageing is their shortened lifespan.	30
1	Jesus. That was a lot of fluid. Blood?	30
1	Any brush that touches a fatty is a toilet brush.	30
1	Yup...was one of Chris Farley's problems besides cocaine and hookers. His close friends had said he would break down about wanting to lose weight but was scared people wouldn't think he was funny then.	30
1	I guess the people working in the North Carolina DMV are fatties.	30
1	There's a cap and gown in both photos	30
1	Best thing I've seen all day	30
1	You do not see 40+ because heart attacks thin out the ranks.	30
1	Because you know you have to be "OBSESSED" to look decent...as cheesy as that saying is, it's perfect here: "Obsessed' is a word the lazy use to describe the dedicated."	30
1	Wait I think she set it to determine mental capacity.	30
1	I'm a hairstylist and clients will often ask for a style that slims their face. I just smile and say, "honey it's a comb, not a wand" and then suggest a pixie cut. Fat ladies love short hair. Less time styling=more time for eating and binge watching Netflix	30
1	And a ham just stopped the Nemo ride.....	30
1	To me, those people are no different than feeders. One does it for some fucked up sexual gratification, the other does it to keep the money rolling in. I think I get angrier at those kinds of scum even more than fat people, because they themselves are rarely that fucking big, so clearly they know it's unhealthy but are pushing it anyway. Fucking degenerates encouraging suicide by burger.	30
1	Nobody remembers Jared Leto did it too when he played Mark David Chapman. Of course nobody remembers because he was fucking unrecognizable and gross.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_27	30
1	He begged to be in that movie and only made $60k from it.	30
1	Fatpeoplehate pun of the week!	30
1	Wait, is it difficult for some normal people to wash the small of their backs? That one's as easy as wiping my bunghole. It's the space around my shoulder blades that takes a bit of maneuvering.	30
1	Being overweight is a hell from which diet is the only escape  Get the fuck out you sympathizer, stay behind the tape  That separates FPH from the drivel that infects reddit  Having people like you here, I utterly dread it  You come to a sub noble and pure, we have hate for the fats  Spouting this fucking comment, banned until your stats  With a photo name stamped, verify you are not a beast  One who chugs butter, and every meal is a feast.  Mod mail it quickly if you wish to continue posting here  But actually with this shit, unbanning in your future is not near	30
1	I feel like it's also a case of inbreeding	30
1	I heard it was for a role, pretty sad that they want him to be a fat guy instead of making the most of the new and probably much more able healthy him.  I haven't seen many of his movies but it seems that he is just a fat daft clumsy guy in everything.	30
1	Awoooooooooo (in a tiny voice)	30
1	That's what happened to Chris Farley. Jonah needs to go have a long talk with David Spade about how fucking meaningless it is to make money by throwing away your health.	30
1	This story sounds $100% true.	30
1	Lets go 3.5 to be on the safe side of science.	30
1	I thought blood coagulated in the stomach making brown/black chunks as opposed to brown/black liquid.  Looks to me like he just ate too much before his match and suffered the consequences. I've been there after thinking "Yeah, two cups of black coffee is a suitable breakfast before mountain biking!"]  I could easily be wrong on both accounts though.	30
1	You must have been in the military. I have never heard "mudshark" used by non military folks. And yes, your description is accurate.	30
1	[This badass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ3cRBcPU-Q) in panel 7, too.	30
1	From that video and the previous one, she came down with pneumonia and is on a ventilator.  It sounds like she's stable now and is slowly being weaned off.  The only sources are the other sister's videos.	30
1	That and the slurping sound of her licking the wrapper….ughhh	30
1	Eh, if he turned down Liz Taylor he deserved to get fat. That woman was a goddess.	30
1	I'm not totally sure on this, but I think it also has something to do with coal burners, actual ones, often getting covered in black while handling coal, and because of any detritus coming from the smoke	30
1	Ha! Lasting 7 minutes in the sack is a high standard? Jesus Christ I'm good hahaha	30
1	I don't even care if they try skydiving, go for it I say.  It's horseback riding that pisses me off. Animals don't deserve abuse so you can feel better about yourself.	30
1	Ugh, I used to work the Haunted Mansion. Our standard spiel is "two or three bodies per buggy please". So of course they'll try to stuff three of their hambodies in there, causing the ride to stop and everyone having to shuffle around.	30
1	He's a Fupa Mario Brother.	30
1	And when we say we like a lady with curves, [this](http://www3.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Claire+Sinclair+Pin+Up+Show+Premieres+Las+0sHm3_QkFoNl.jpg) is what we have in mind!	30
1	Landwhale heaven would be a Walmart that has a Starbucks, a McDonald's, and scooty lanes in the store. Heaven for them and a perfect hell for us.	30
1	Ugh deluxe dining plan. Went with the shitlady and her parents, I don't think I've ever eaten so much dessert in my life. Not that I'm a food snob, I just legit don't have a sweet tooth. Every lunch and dinner I'd get a $5 hunk of cake or something that I'd have to take a few bites of to be polite, since we'd already paid for it.	30
1	Shocking that someone that prides themselves on advertising that they actively take joy in the suffering of people that aren't like them would be equally disgusting both outside and in.	30
1	I think septum piercings can look good on actual humans.  Edit: spelling	30
1	ahaha, this makes so much more sense	30
1	Why is it always "hurting your body" with dieting? I'm hurting it by not filling it full of shit? OH NOES, I MIGHT GET NUTRIENTS, FUCK THOSE THINGS.	30
1	Seriously WTF man!! Just zero fucking shame or regard for anyone else... I cant imagine what a god awful shitty person she must be... probably why she resorts to eating since no one can stand being next to her moldy cheeze wiz ass crack smell...	30
1	I think that's what it comes down to. Since I started hitting the gym I find the "hardbody" girls more attractive than before. Now the normal skinny girls look kind of delicate and sickly to me.	30
1	Trivia: Marlon hated being a sex symbol and admitted in several interviews that being sexualized made him extremely uncomfortable. He started to let himself go, my guess is subconsciously like a victim of sexual assault who puts on weight after the attack as a defense mechanism to make themselves less desirsble. I read that about him quite a few times and thought I'd share.  Joke: The funny thing about aging is that we spend the first half of our lives trying to look like Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor, and the second half trying not to.	30
1	Needed this so bad. Thank you!	30
1	Was this the thing from 600 lb life?	30
1	Mom here. Not into "dad bods". Ever.	30
1	Don't forget rape laws that define rape as penetrative therefore making men who were forced to penetrate not rape victims.  Oh and the Duluth Model for domestic violence that means men are more likely to get arrested than get help if they report their female abusers  (U.S.)	30
1	Bitches need to be reminded that they are not acceptable...	30
1	It's delicious on everything. I even butter my cookie dough quest bars because it makes them taste more like cookies and sometimes I just really miss cookies on keto. Pinterest recipes are lies. Burnt, weird tasting lies.    What super irks me is the amount of butter substitutes in grocery stores and lack of actual butter. So many times I've almost grabbed some spreadable hybrid, or 50/50 margarine/butter mix :(	30
1	Yeah be a shitlord, not a dick.	30
1	Except she pioneered #HeForShe which does a bangup job of turning domestic violence into a gendered issue when it isn't.  Edit: trigger warning - proponent of personal responsibility   Christina Hoff Sommers is the only "famous" feminist I can actually get behind.	30
1	It reports back as 73.          http://imgur.com/jN6uPwn	30
1	Let's not do that internet witchhunt shit on here. Leave that to tumblr.	30
1	Know what all those guys have in common?  They can see their genitals.	30
1	It makes me really sad... Like this depressed sinking feeling. I hate it. Which is probably why I hate them. No matter how nice they are, they're just going to die early and leave their friends/family behind which is selfish and makes me hate them more... QUIT FUCKING EATING.	30
1	Marry doorframe, fuck shelf, kill self. It's the only way to avoid the fats.	30
1	Go figure... The worst case of man-spreading to date appears to have originally been a female.  Now it's just an amorphous blob.	30
1	Perfect time for a sequel to "Accepted" where Jonah will play an even bigger fat fuck who eventually dies a horrible death, it will seem like a comedy until 20 mins in then just be all about how stupid and disgusting fat people are to the rest of us.	30
1	Buttered bars sound amazing!!! Lol at hybrid butter. My local market has Amish homemade butter (fairly unusual for my part of the country, but I'm glad to have it). If I can't get that I go for good old kerrygold Irish grass fed butter- available at most grocery stores.	30
1	Slightly? He went from "probably not criminal, just gross" to "criminally psychotic narcissist with the serious potential for stalking and sex-crime" in one sentence. I'd say that's more than *slightly*.  Otherwise, though, I agree with you.	30
1	That picture just triggered me. Now I have to go run...	30
1	Can someone please post what he thought a healthy diet was? I'd love to see the delusion.    Maybe he was eating vegan or organic so he thought the calories didn't count (tee hee)?!	30
1	You don't think [this](http://oddstuffmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Knock_Nevis.jpg) baby will cut it?	30
1	Next up is eating batter	30
1	Nothing like obvious proof that your nipples are on the bottom utters	30
1	Did you see what that burger was wearing? It was asking to be eaten.	30
1	I've seen it on thin chicks and it's honestly a really cute piercing on a human face.	30
1	Downvoted by people who don't like racist assholes.	30
1	:|==========כ  That looks like something else.....	30
1	He's busted too dude. FUGLY people don't give a fuck. Never have and never will. His choice was either suicide or a shitty life with this piece of shit. Unfortunately he is alive.	30
1	What "successful" model posts about needing a mattress? Can't she just go, get herself one and shut the hell up?   Oh right, she's an attention addict, immobile, lazy bitch.	30
1	Thin privilege is not thinking that food is going to crawl up your hoo-ha without your consent.	30
1	" I am sorry Mario, but the princess is in another body".	30
1	As a rape victim, this infuriates me beyond words.	30
1	No, that's not true.  Her second chin seems to have become more pronounced	30
1	Uhggg!!! That's not even a real corset!!!! That looks like a cheap eBay corset with plastic boning. See how it's bending like that? Real corsets are rigid and shape you, you shouldn't be able to shape a corset! That "corset" ( it's a bustier at best) won't last more than a day and not just because it's trying it's hardest to stay closed around 300+lbs of lard.	30
1	Hold on, are you saying I shouldn't do cocaine and hookers?	30
1	I think they must have meant the top part between your shoulder blades. I can't imagine many people not being able to reach the small of their back.	30
1	It'd be even funnier if he was just fucking with her.	30
1	Running in to other shitlords is the best feeling	30
1	I don't find it hard but it's hard to exfoliate my entire back cause I can't get even pressure. My spidery limbs get all twisted up :(	30
1	Help a noob. What is HAES?	30
1	Guys that lift are very much going to want to lift you because lifting the woman you're with into the air just sets something off in both of you.	30
1	I want to snap its fucking neck.	30
1	[Original Article](http://www.pulsevoices.org/index.php/archive/stories/327-supersize-me) describes the trouble one obese patient brings into the ER. His bloodwork is normal!! HAES!!!!!!!! Except he is found dead in his home as the article later reveals.  [Edited Version](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/a-morbidly-obese-patient-tests-the-limits-of-a-doctors-compassion/2014/02/24/faf80438-7df9-11e3-9556-4a4bf7bcbd84_story.html) Only difference I can see is that it left out how the patient had died.  This is irresponsible and it makes me sick.	30
1	I would love to know how far I could simply walk. Not jog,not run, but walk. How sad of an excuse for a human do you need to be to not even be able to walk two miles...	30
1	Let's not get crazy now.	30
1	As a lady, you are 100% correct. ew ew ew ew ew ew	30
1	Health at every size. Basically, they claim one's weight doesn't correlate with how healthy they are.	30
1	He was a 22 year old who apparently was so dumb he didn't know how many calories were in anything... Lame excuse if you ask me.	30
1	I kept making this "fwoomp" sound. Heh.	30
1	God damn...  I mean I'm sure that even the biggest shitlords out there enjoy eating junk food once in a blue moon. Maybe even splurge as long as it's not an everyday occurrence. But seriously, the thought of that much fat and grease going into one human mouth makes me nauseous.	30
1	"Your tits were on time but you were 5 minutes late"	30
1	I can understand wanting to rape\* a packet of Doritos, but being raped by a packet of Doritos doesn't sound so much fun.  \**rape: an act of plunder,*	30
1	It's just not fair. Some people are born with that "long walks" gene.	30
1	Oh god that video was huge and I was not ready. Wow.	30
1	Abuse victim. I'm seeing red.	30
1	&gt; There's a bunch of pictures of her running though and the best way to improve would probably be muscle work.   Despite what /r/swoleacceptance would have you believe, there's nothing wrong with keeping fit through cardio. Not everyone wants to buff up.	30
1	Oh my god you weren't kidding. You could slap that shit on the side of a package of diapers and no one would bat an eye.	30
1	But at least you're not fat	30
1	Why is margarine worse for your body?  Do you have a source for that?  Facts, please.  The 'one molecule away from plastic' is a stupid scare tactic.	30
1	I hope I don't get banned for this but I think that he is funnier when he is fat. Superbad is one of my favorite movies and his lines just crack me up. And then there is thong scene from Strange Wilderness: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfTWZAy2nTs	30
1	Sub is 18+.  Benned.	30
1	Yep like a helium balloon 2 days after the party.	30
1	Because they're unhealthy I'd wager.	30
1	The fault is its other condishuns: dyslexia	30
1	Guys...I work there and you would not imagine (probably would tho) the ridiculous sugar laden 500 calorie drinks people get and then "just a snack" slices of pound cake. They consume 1000 calories In a visit they think is just a quick coffee. This one lard bucket comes in AT 6 AM IN THE MORNING and gets a LARGE FRAPPUCCINO. I almost want to throw up when I make it.	30
1	That can be in response to most things	30
1	Maybe both are before pictures and she's skinny now? Just kidding.	30
1	Hambeasts are always trivializing/ignoring serious issues while bringing non-issues up as if they're ruining everyone's lives. It's just the result of their fucked up priority system stemming from their lost touch with reality. I mean honestly, can you expect a 300+ lbs. "woman" who believes (pretends to believe) that she's attractive to understand that PTSD and triggers are two very real and very serious things? No, of course not. She's so confused and delusional I'm surprised she hasn't declared her "triggurs" in an entirely new, and more harmful category than those seen in war vets, etc.	30
1	Oompa loompa + Violet Beauregard = my worst nightmare	30
1	I wore a shirt a few weeks ago that said "Trigger Warning: Healthy BMI" and I got some mean stares from the pink haired septum ringed tumblerinas.  As desired.	30
1	So pathetic. How sad must your life be if you are intimidated by a cartoon character?	30
1	Happens a lot when someone loses a lot of weight and has no muscle mass at all, and sometimes we just can't adjust our prior perception of a person. I thought the same thing about the Man vs Food guy but he had actually been exercising a lot as I understood it.	30
1	I think the left one is senior year, the picture looks like a senior picture. The right one looks older. Not that she looks any different.	30
1	The guy is pretty young too. Losing and gaining this kind of weight, this quickly, and repeatedly is brutal on a body. I'd imagine it's as damaging as just staying fat.	30
1	A tanning consultant? I have a feeling she may be using the tanning beds as ovens and sneaking a few unfortunate 100+ lbs. snacks every hour.	30
1	As a chemist it really irks me when people say things like that or the common "it has chemicals in it", most everything is a molecule away when you don't specify what molecule is being added	30
1	The elderly make the BEST shitlords. My grandma is the shitlady who taught me to hate fat people like I do today. Her **udder** (teehee) hatred for the fat, lazy cows is inspiring &lt;3	30
1	They have overlooked the fact that at least half of us are female.	30
1	&gt; I'm determined, motivated, and persistent  Stalker  &gt; I'll make u laugh &amp; cook u the best dinner ever  Rabbit  &gt; Extra cookie points  Nah, it ate all those  &gt;rather be moving forward than not moving at all  Is this a set up?  &gt; I know I have boobs  Faaaaaaaaaaat  &gt; Yes my eyes are real  This is a common question. Think about that.  &gt; I don't mind getting dirty  I doubt you ever get clean	30
1	Oh, am I a neckbeard living in my parent's basement? I thought I was a 34 year old graduate student, wife, and mom. My bad.	30
1	I wonder what she sees in the mirror.	30
1	I'm glad Red is kind enough to help you through this &lt;3	30
1	I hate fats with beards. Gives the rest of us a bad name.	30
1	It's open-source... they can make Gabriel Iglesias the hero if they care so much.	30
1	It's going to give hams a rude awakening when they see a new shitlord ad in not only London but also NYC in a few weeks.	30
1	It looks like she smudged chocolate all over herself.	30
1	&gt; moderation  Is that some sort of pastry?	30
1	Huh. I didn't think I was capable of growing a beard on anything other than my vagina, but my parents have a finished basement, so I got that going for me, which is nice.	30
1	Racism is different. People choose to be fat, but you can't choose your race.	30
1	I thought I was a fairly independent 30 year old woman living several states from her relatives, but I guess I could be wrong!	30
1	OMG Finals is when I lose weight because I forget to eat because I'm balls deep in the IRS tax code. Who has time to eat during finals?!?!?	30
1	Damn, then let me sue some colleges for discrimination because I didn't meet their SAT standards. Sorry I wasn't born smart, it's guneticz!	30
1	My aunt cited this little fun fact at one of our thanksgiving dinners. I started laughing and said something about that being a "huge difference, just look how close or DNA is to an ape's". Everyone got quiet for several seconds after that and then started talking about something else and my aunt didn't speak again for the rest of dinner. I'm socially awkward.	30
1	TIL I'm a neckbearded lady that lives in her parents basement.	30
1	Well, fucking stop!	30
1	Yep; last time I checked I work full time and attend school full time, with no vacations. But I'm clearly a jaded, basement-dwelling, neckbeard that can't focus on anything or achieve goals.	30
1	Is there a word for a phobia of an empty plate? I'm sure they have that too.	30
1	&gt; Put that ice cream down, bitch! You're both killing yourself with food.  Seriously! A bullet would be much faster...	30
1	OMG I need this shirt.	30
1	Apparently we are TRP.  Typical fat logic.	30
1	Lol I'll toss it on my site tomorrow. Stating at $7 minus my shitlord coupon code.	30
1	Her crooked tits in the first pic made me grab my own for comfort and security &lt;_&lt;	30
1	You should have your mom make us some sammiches while we play D&amp;D.  Your mom is so cool.	30
1	The fuck is she supposed to be? a fat demon?	30
1	I heard that same thing when Melissa McCarthy was trying to lose weight.  They tried to discourage her and told her to stay an elephant for her film career.	30
1	Except type 2 diabetic fatties often can't see or feel their festering wounds.	30

1	And another 10 years, can we just go ahead and say Jonah Planet?	30
1	I have recently discovered the magic that is Kerrygold, and my life has gotten so much better.	30
1	I check this sub every day, and every day there are posts about how much über fat people eat. All I can think about, every time, is how in the hell they can afford it. That's like 18 dollars worth of sugar.	30
1	Maybe, that's what people are speculating anyways. He did used to date a nutritionist anyways.	30
1	&gt; I can climb up six flights of stairs at work.  You're a goddamn Olympic athlete, you.	30
1	*RIGHT?!??!?!*	30
1	not to mention cheaper.	30
1	One of the slaton sisters. Tammy the other one is on life support for some obesity related complication...HAES!!!!	30
1	That mustache is doing him no favors.	30
1	I love it. It's a great breakfast substitute.	30
1	Hopefully that woosh didn't mess your hair.	30
1	I wish it wasn't http://imgur.com/LumL5QQ http://imgur.com/JItpsy4	30
1	Gotta wonder about the screening practices for these kinds of surgeries. My only real exposure to bypasses is from "My 600 lbs Life" and that doc makes each patient lose 30 lbs in a month before he even considers them for surgery. Is that not normal? How'd this puddin' pop sneak through?	30
1	Like all those nachos forced themselves inside her.	30
1	How do you feel about food being labelled as "organic"? What is the non-organic stuff, "metallic"?	30
1	Guarantee you "real women" will complain about the lack of their representation in favor for "small fats."	30
1	Oh Kerrygold, I miss that. My (Irish) nan used to keep it hidden in the larder while we got the cheap stuff most of the time. I'm going to see if I can get that in Australia.	30
1	They have several videos that have been posted on fph. Tammy has a forehead fat roll that makes her look more alien than human...they are kind of a freakshow	30
1	Has to be a troll post, nobody can be that stupid... right guys?	30
1	Every school has a kid like this.  In middle school and high school this kid named Brian was one of the football team's stars. Star running back, big time weight lifter and ate like a fucking horse. He'd do anything for a buck so people would regularly cheer him on as he ate whatever weird shit was put in front of him for laughs.  Now he's 28 and planning on having bariatric surgery because he kept eating 8,000 calories a day when he became almost completely sedentary in an office job after high school.	30
1	Really? That's awesome and it explains a lot.	30
1	It's hard to tell, but it looks like that's actually the back of her knee, rather than just a gigantic roll by itself. Really gross that it's hard to tell.	30
1	I have no words. I knew it was coming. With each picture I knew I was about to see the transformation take place. And it made me sad.  How could he? HE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.	30
1	I've only watched a couple...one was them shoving marshmallows in their mouth, another was one of them opening a box of makeup samples, another was them answering questions from "fans" lol. They seem like they are missing chromosomes or something.	30
1	Body head bangerz - can't be stopped . I believe that's what it is. I had a troubled youth lol	30
1	It makes it really amusing when I'm reading health related posts that's for sure, I'd certainly love to see an inorganic carrot or piece of meat that is actually edible haha	30
1	All this time Karl Pilkington was actually talking about fat people, not Chinese people.	30
1	That's probably the unfunniest thing that looks hilarious I've ever seen.   (I guess it is funny with context judging by the reactions but shit that gif meant nothing)	30
1	Was it an Australian on here that said Tim Tams are the devils sweets? I was told these things are the tits mcgee.	30
1	in this case, I'm not so sure being fat will kill her.  it's going to be a hell of a race between obesity and skin cancer in the next 10 or so years.	30
1	I'm a middle-aged man who owns his own basement.	30
1	Lol at the 95 calorie muffin.	30
1	You &amp; I both know that 90% of what she eats doesn't go in her logs.  "oh 6 oreos? They don't really count because it was just once only, so i won't enter them here"	30
1	lol that's not the reason at all, that's some straight hocus pocus bullshit  research has shown that obese kids generally go into puberty way before everybody else because of chemical imbalances in the body from being so fucking fat  so the reason why they look older is because they're biologically older than their not fat counter-parts, by the time her 8th grade photo was taken, she was probably finishing her final stages of puberty.  [source](http://time.com/8693/young-kids-old-bodies/)	30
1	I hate fat gamers. Pisses me off. Get out of your goddamn chair and go do something worthy with your life. I especially hate fat girl gamers that constantly bitch about their weight and wear "slutty" (more disgusting than it is slutty) outfits while streaming or recording to get more viewers. Your big boobs don't count if you're fat. Cover that shit up.	30
1	Haha old people that give no fucks are the best. "garbage bag of cottage cheese" lol RIP my sides	30
1	Maybe if we keep browsing FPH, it will finally start coming in.	30
1	Equality is for things you have no power over, being fat isn't one of those things.	30
1	55 calories exercise? What is that from? "I walked to the fridge"	30
1	Look at those floppy bags of mayonaise pretending to be proper tits!	30
1	And then taking a fat wet shit	30
1	There's also "all-natural", which strictly speaking is anything that didn't come out of a supercollider or nuclear reactor.	30
1	This right here.  I see that at the gym all the freaking time.	30
1	Old people make the best shitlords.  My grandpa was approached by an older lady at a family function, after he had lost considerable weight from trying to take better care of himself.  Old lady: "my goodness, you have lost a lot of weight!  what did you do?"  Grandpa:  "well apparently I gave it all to you."	30
1	She looks like a young Beth from dog the bounty hunter.	30
1	When a fattie talks about their healthy diets I just remember the videos of Michael Phelps eating 5,000 calories for breakfast because his WARM UP was 5-10 miles of swimming.  These 600lb reality stars are what happens when you remove the swimming.	30
1	Impossibly in shape? I literally see women like the one in the ad every day of my life.	30
1	That's crazy, we were going into the Coral Reef restaurant right around when you posted that. It's such a warming feeling knowing a fellow shitlord was in the same area.   And then kinda depressing knowing that hating fat people is not something easily shared publicly.	30
1	The fat will rotate but the bones will not because you can't get a grip on them being buried so deep.	30
1	I was. High school sucked yo. Lost all my fatty weight freshman year of uni, haven't looked back.	30
1	Best is the "from natural sources" because literally everything is. Gotta love vaguely descriptive identifiers!	30
1	Chevy Chase is also a big fit to fat and he's a huge jerk too	30
1	I think you may be confusing him with Rock Hudson.	30
1	Look at the skin on her boobs...already leathery and on its way to cancer town.	30
1	I gotta say I'm a little relieved. When I looked at the picture, I thought it had shit itself and I was really scared to read the story...	30
1	Three hours? As a shitlord you are ok. As a fatty, you would go into starvation mode, thus gaining even more weight.	30
1	Lol. The Red Pill is a bunch of whiney fat neck beards. They would get torn apart over here	30
1	...and time to change my panties. That first gif gets me every time and now the last gif is my second favorite.	30
1	How does that even fit into a tanning bed? Or even get onto one?	30
1	"I perceived it as" ah so in other words you made shit up to feel like a victim.	30
1	hmm, I'm always just a little skeptical of the stories behind Facebook posts that say published "just now".	30
1	Yep.  I can eat a LOT, and the thought of shoveling all of that into my maw in one day makes me think about all of the vomiting and diarrhea that'd come with it. What the fuck.	30
1	Holding the record for the worlds fattest person is like holding the record for worlds oldest person.  You probably won't live to see another year.	30
1	Body like a fucking orange.	30
1	Pretty sure she is manipulating her food diary to stay under her goals. Would also explain the 55 kcal of exercise lol	30
1	95 calorie muffin. Riiiiiiiiiiight.	30
1	Eh, my school just had kids snorting wasabi powder	30
1	Please teach me the arts of beetus. For one without beetus has no true gains.	30
1	Ah, Dove.  "We market to fat people, because they need more soap per wash"	30
1	Is this in Winnipeg? We had a McDonalds burn down the other week	30
1	I call shenanigans on 'man'.  Not as in man vs woman.  I mean man vs manatee.	30
1	I mean, my home gym is in my basement, and I do spend a bit of time down there, but I would hardly say I *live* there. Also, I'm a chick.	30
1	I imagine this is what all Planet Fitness instructors look like.	30
1	Man that trainer probably can squad 200 doughnuts.	30
1	Seriously! I thought it was only gonna go in a little and suddenly it's buried to the hilt and just *gag*	30
1	Why do fatties always think buying the most expensive shit will help them lose weight faster? Just some more typical fat logic.	30
1	"Impossibly in-shape" HAHAHAHA	30
1	Original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9VD7QvYfx8  Update: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al_0_kxX_eU	30
1	I love how in the third photo she uses that shitty filter to hide her ham body.	30
1	Training people on how to do what? Give up?	30
1	Do you follow them to McDonalds?	30
1	I was going to say that, good to see fellow shitlords in Winnipeg!	30
1	"Reality Planets" FTFY	30
1	People finally standing up to the fat filled logic on the internet.	30
1	I love that accusation the most, because this is one of the most anti-TRP subs that I've ever seen.	30
1	Pathetic lanky chubby chasing loser that thinks going after fat chicks would be easier. Too bad for him the only guys fatties like are fit models.	30
1	Whenever I get a muffin (once a year or so) I just go ahead and estimate it at 500 kcal.  It's worth it because I get them so rarely, but 95 kcal? Was it baked in a bottle cap?	30
1	I feel you. Alot of fake content flying around here now just for karma. Especially the "This fatty used to bully me" crap.	30
1	Yeah... I'm pretty funny ;)  And drunk  And I hate fatties	30
1	lol.  She lists only eating one tenth of a chocolate bar and then lists another chocolate bar and only eating two tenths.  Why waste an already opened bar by opening another bar that you aren't even going to fully eat?  She's only lying to herself.	30
1	this is why i have my username.  we must reclaim this piercing from the hams that have tainted it. i haven't given up on the septum ring (though if i'm being totally honest, i'm starting to)	30
1	That was painful to read. Someone didn't do their coding right.	30
1	They are basically the male counterpart of SJWs.  Equally as whiny. Equally as repulsive. Equal sense of entitlement.	30
1	It's the trainer for Man vs Food	30
1	The worst part is she says she's ready to lose weight.if you just had the surgery Monday why would chocolate pudding be a good idea	30
1	Dirtiest bulk of all time.	30
1	This is one of those things you read, jaw drop at the burn,  then make mental not of it to say at some point in your life.   seriously, that was a solid 10/10	30
1	Sales went through the roof thanks to the controversy, I would not be surprised to see them trying to keep the fire alive.  Wouldn't it be amazing if the entire fitness world jumped on board this train?	30
1	Interesting factoid, the SAS would eat a load of butter before going to drink so they apparently stayed sober as the butter coated the stomach and digestive track. This was so they could infiltrate the ira and casually drink with them. Read it in some book back in the day.	30
1	Tanning and morbid obesity, the two most unattractive things in today's culture combined!	30
1	My great grandpa was a pack a day smoker that lived into his late 90s, I get smoking cigarettes isn't as bad as everyone makes it seem.  What matters when determining if something is health how it affects people, on average, when all other factors are controlled for. You're not automatically dooming yourself to die at 30 from being overweight, of course not, there are fat people in late age. But you're seriously reducing your chances of a long life, and reducing the quality of the life you do live.	30
1	No, "moderation" is the group of assholes that ban the righteous social justice workers from FatPeopleHate.  Death to moderation! Death to the wretched hive of scum and villainy! Death to the thins!	30
1	I wish I could remember some of the shit my grandfather said because I distinctly remember being like "woah grandpa did you really just say that shit to that butter bandit?"	30
1	Fucking Karl. I love that bald shit-lord ape. He's brilliant.	30
1	90% of the time I try to help people out they are simply not being honest with themselves or don't understand portions. They log 2oz of meat but actually eat 6, just don't enter something, snack and state "one chocolate won't hurt". I knew someone who I watched eat 3/4 a bag of chips, and logged 1 serving. They just don't have a clue, buy a scale, weigh your shit and log fucking everything, even if you don't perceive significant caloric value, even goddamn water, log it.	30
1	I'm no zoologist but I can tell the difference between a hippo and a rhino. Besides the other one has that weird fat forehead thing and this one always looks like it's choking.  Edit: Just looked again and now I'm not so sure. That thing actually looks more like the dinosaur shit from Jurassic Park than anything that exists in the animal kingdom.	30
1	Thank you.. And GOOD GOD, there were way too many distractions in this video, the constant hair fixing, the chest acne, the numerous chins, the pancake tits, the smoking, and the incomprehensible speech. This is an abomination	30
1	Why...why did the fat fuck who compared fat-bullying to rape still have positive karma?	30
1	I was nearly overweight (I was fat, just not overweight according to BMI, but goddammit, I was fat) in high school.  It took nothing to stop eating so much shit and drink calorie-free soda. Note I said 'so much' shit, not just 'shit'. I kept eating shit. I just didn't eat a fuckload of shit at one time.	30
1	I hate that about myfitnesspal. It adds your calories burned back to your available calories to eat and they always over estimate, so I just don't enter them.	30
1	My motto - you can drink'em pretty, but you can't drink'em skinny	30
1	It *used* to be full of trans fats, think some people just think it is still bad and it is a yoyo effect of how people thought it was healthier than butter and finding out that was wrong.	30
1	Yeah, hopefully now that they're owned by under armor, their exercise data will improve.	30
1	I went to a wing place one time that said all of its meals came with a side of celery and carrots. I split a 20 piece with my bf and there were only two each of celery and carrot sticks.  Probably makes it easy for a fatass to say they've had a serving of vegetables.	30
1	Seriously, how messed up is it that you can't even walk! That's the most basic human movement. This baffles me	30
1	It's turtles all the way down!	30
1	I mean if we get to vote let's just make it 20.	30
1	she is literally fatter than he is in this image, the image which is supposed to be absurdly obese. that's pretty bad.	30
1	Reminds me of the fatty trying to give me healthy eating advice yesterday - "so basically I'm going to do the opposite of everything you just said, alrighty."	30
1	Yeah, TEDx is a fucking joke. They really should rebrand those talks so that the two don't get confused.	30
1	[I don't even know what I'm looking at,](http://i.imgur.com/a0xGdaE.gif)	30
1	he's definitely an old shitlord, but he's an old Irish shitlord, which is a fattie cruelty magnifier.	30

1	She ate the whole thing and logged .1. But lying to mfp doesn't count.	30
1	Yes, this is the fucker who uprooted his family so he could get treatment, and stopped for fast food on the way out and lied about it to the doctor he was moving to see	30
1	I didn't even know it was possible to have fat in your blood	30
1	You should review your posts for clarity and grammar before submitting.	30
1	That eyeliner looks so smudged and trashy.  Cute is a very strong word....	30
1	How about severe head trauma from multiple attackers wielding baseball bats.	30
1	Most places do that, I've never had chicken wings that didn't come with 2 1cm cut celery and carrots each. I don't know how they call it a side.	30
1	Oh my gosh, that saved my life.	30
1	Fucken fat cunts. Looks at all the down votes the shitlord got when they called the ham out. How could anyone support that analogy. Set those fuckers on fire.	30
1	They want to be offended. Don't take that from them.  It's all they have.	30
1	In advertising we call this "puffery" - a promotional statement or claim that expresses subjective rather than objective views, which no "reasonable person" would take literally. Puffery serves to "puff up" an exaggerated image of what is being described.	30
1	I love how it's totally okay to say "if you're a man you need to gain some weight!" But the second you offend a fat princess you're literally Hitler.	30
1	THAT EYELINER IS HORRIBLE. I mean, she's bad without it, but that makeup makes me irrationally mad.	30
1	I must be gaining a ton of weight with intermittent fasting! I've been in starvation mode for 16 hours a day! Thanks for opening my eyes.	30
1	I just wish there was some standard TED held them up to. A student club here runs Tedx and they sell out. Went to them twice and besides the unidan one, most were pretty good talks	30
1	I'm still amazed that things like gay beatings take place. Had a friend come out to us at a hardcore conservative church, and the worst reaction he got was, "hmm I'm not sure how I feel about it, but it's not really my business anyway, we still love you." Is this sort of thing common?	30
1	So something that I'm confused about is the notion feminism=equality. I thought that was egalitarianism and on that note I don't understand why an everyone is equal movement would be called feminism vs something like the equality movement. Not on topic but I don't get it.	30
1	If there is a height limit for most rides due to safety, there should definitely be weight limit involved! That seems so irresponsible to allow these landwhales to stop other people from having fun by breaking down the rides.	30
1	Yeah what the hell? Muffins have a huge amount of calories, easily at least 380. Unless this is a mini muffin or just the top, I don't see how it's 90ish.	30
1	You wouldn't even begin to believe. I've never seen one below the 215-230 range.	30
1	&gt;1 interest, "Lil Wayne".	30
1	Hatr.  Fitstr.  Uhhhh... Hot, fit Redditr?	30
1	Thin privilege is having blood that doesn't look like a creamsicle.  Seriously, I didn't even know this was possible.	30
1	That travel agent is my SO	30
1	Oh god that sounds painful. I had some friends that decided to snort some powdered sugar. Their reaction made me realize that I *never* want to do cocaine. It's the little things in life.	30
1	As a victim of sexual assault, I want to scream. I want to fucking slam her face into the pavement over and over. How fucking DARE she compare making willing choices to eat better and work out to something no one has control over.	30
1	BRIAN ITS ALWAYS A FUCKING BRIAN. Or Ryan.	30
1	4 Yorkies for a quid? I guess you mean multipacks and smaller sized ones because standard individual ones go for about 70p!	30
1	I miss being on keto! The way I felt was always worth it, the only thing I really miss is a couple of fruits that you can't eat while on the diet, and some recetas mexicanas.	30
1	I'm able to not need antidepressants because I maintain myself through regular exercise.	30
1	That dog.....that dog has seen some SHIT	30
1	I find it difficult to cheer for just one.	30
1	Kids at my school snorted lemon salt. ._.	30
1	Face shot: check. Neck tits: check. Heavy makeup: check. Diagnosis: fatty.	30
1	Dude had 3 people put the thicker curse on him.	30
1	Asian and I do have a dick. I sympathise.	30
1	maybe it'll be a tie!	30
1	Hey when I did Keto I put butter on everything, ate til I was full and lost weight!	30
1	Observation; it's fat.   Hypothesis; it eats too much.   Test; cut open yards of fat.   Confirm hypothesis.	30
1	She's only lazy because whenever she exercises her knees start to hurt. Not her fault guys. /s	30
1	Blood Type: Strawberry Milkshake	30
1	I want to read this story over and over. This Jewish Shitlady gives it two thumbs up.	30
1	It was real sad about what happened to farley. Watching interviews with him in the few years toward the end it was easy to tell he hated being over weight but his career came to depend on it. The coke heroin and hookers life style was along with his size was a recipe for disaster.	30
1	He's actually a fantastic trainer. That is, if your goal is to be able to consume 10,000 calories a day and give up on life. In that regard, yes he's incredible.	30
1	I once (foolishly) tried to get a ham to go to the gym. Went something like this:  "I can't do (exercise) because have bad knees!" "Oh! Ok. What's wrong with them? We can work around it." "I don't know, they're just bad." "Have you seen a doctor and gotten a diagnosis?" "No. But my whole family has bad knees. They're bad."  The family was a full-blown whale pod.	30
1	That almost looks like progeria.  Obviously a serious medical condition next to a woman who is maybe 20lbs overweight.  Bigger fish to fry.  This is just weird and cruel.	30
1	because healthy food is more expensive obviously! /s	30
1	I knew a guy who snorted salt. Like... 8 thick lines of the shit for $20.  He then vomited and got another $25 to drink it.  No shit.	30
1	Starvation mode is a real thing. When you are seriously underweight and not getting enough energy to survive, your body will slow down your metabolism to reduce the amount of energy it needs to live. I've experienced this first hand. But it only occurs in seriously underweight/anorexic people, never in fat people. Fat people have huge energy reserves so the body doesn't need to slow it's metabolism in order to maintain its usual energy intake. The article posted on here about the fat guy who didn't eat for over a year is proof of that.	30
1	She does seem to be a present victim of those assholes. She was totally genuine beforehand to. when she acted in 'the nines' it was a meaningful part and movie. Now she plays roles specifically to be entertaining for her size. I bet it kills her on the inside.	30
1	Im from a family full of shitlords. Me and my parents will watch 600 pound life and make comments on how disgusting they are. Parents work out constantly and im just glad barely anyone in my family is fat. Don't attempt to converse with whales btw, They are a different species than us.	30
1	Doctoral student here. Those are all of the solids in the blood, with either the serum or plasma at the bottom. Depends on how they centrifuged it. But you don't have to have a formal education to know that sludge of a sample is not good. Looks like their kidneys are failing because no normal person has that much gunk.	30
1	Sorry, the title's a bit in-factual. Even some of the superheroes have easily attainable bodies, so I don't know what the hell the SJWs are bitching about.	30
1	Oh I learned that lesson after the fatass broke my bench.	30
1	I don't remember the name of it, but she has a disorder where she constantly has to eat because she'll die otherwise. I don't remember why that is, but it's pretty fatal.	30
1	Get a bench like this for them  http://www.curiositiesbydickens.com/wp-content/uploads/whale-tail-bench.jpg	30
1	I went to school with this girl for years... she was a grade below, but it was a small private school so i knew her pretty well. The kids in her class would always talk about how she smelled and how greasy her hair was. Anyone want some more to shitlord at let me know...	30
1	jesus.  that does shine light on the fact that metabolic/weight disorders are almost always readily apparent.  women with pcos typically have male-pattern baldness and five 'o clock shadow. the "conditions" that lazy overeaters claim to suffer with are usually just willpower issues.  it sickens me that people have to battle serious diseases while fat assholes tell people "if i restrict calories my body goes into starvation mode and i gain weight!!"	30
1	Mods, we have a rule #5 condishun here.	30
1	It's funny how they give nutrition and exercise advice.  My favourite was this exchange   F: what's that?     Me: avocado and cucumber soup.     F: avocados have loads of calories.     Got me, my 200kcal lunch is piling on the pounds faster than the bag of Haribos you ate already.	30
1	Male porkers start puberty "later."  [Obesity and the pubertal transition in girls and boys](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2931339/)  &gt;In particular, excess adiposity during childhood may advance puberty in girls and delay puberty in boys.	30

1	He has plenty of money for skin removal surgery.	30
1	10k calories??? That sounds like a workout in itself	30
1	When "it's a small world" went down for the major refurbishment in 2009 at Disneyland, one of the most major changes was the redesign of all passenger boats. They literally had to engineer boats to be more buoyant so the poor operations people didn't have to explain to large families why they all couldn't sit in the front of the same boat. &amp;nbsp;  Also, some families take it upon themselves to redistribute themselves after they are sorted into the vehicle rows. Damn it people, you were strategically placed in those rows to balance the vehicle! No one cares if Big Timmy wanted to sit next to Big Sally!!	30
1	If he didn't know, why make the default assumption that it's healthy?	30
1	Fucking Freds - the biggest lowlife oxygen theives ever. She's lucky she was his first reality check, I bet the next day (if he had the courage and maturity to face humiliation again) he would have verbally abused the non-ham that overtook him	30
1	I remember reading/watching her story. She is unable to gain fat and has 0% body fat, which is why her body looks sucked dry.  Here's her wiki http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizzie_Vel%C3%A1squez	30
1	Goddamn do we have the best mods here.	30
1	"due to being on antidepressants, I retain extra weight."  Fuck that chick, I was on antidepressants for almost three years and was 115lbs. Stop feeding yourself lies and cake and maybe it would help you get off those antidepressants.	30
1	Or English. So much /r/engrish here	30
1	ayyy  bby thx m8 &lt;3	30
1	Nope. Neckbeard it is. I just found out that I'm one too. It's sad, really.	30
1	There are these awesome low-calorie muffins you can make from devil's food cake mix and pumpkin puree (the kind used in pumpkin pie) that are only like 95 calories a serving because those are like the only ingredients and it's fucking heaven.	30
1	My boyfriend has legit bad knees, he can blow out his left one just by leaning wrong. He will definitely need at least one knee replacement before fifty, and he's 185 at 6 feet tall with a good amount of muscle. Fuck fatties and their 'bad knees'.	30
1	Well, technically speaking he is doing 400lb squats every time he stands up, although I doubt that is very often.	30
1	Most fat people I've known complained about always being broke. My close friend has lost a ton of weight since we met (from planet to shitlord fuck yeah) and whaddaya know...she never talks about her money problems now.	30
1	Wasn't she deemed the ugliest woman in the world? (seriously a cruel title to give someone with a legit disorder)	30
1	Or meet up. Have a nice salad lunch or something.	30
1	I'm a bilingual professional with a house, family, degree, black belt, and pets.  I like to read, hike, and do yoga.  It's too bad how I have to maintain my neckbeard while living in my parents' basement and suffer from lack of focus.  I don't look forward to moving to /r/theredpill, but so it has been ordained.	30
1	Arent they both the same? Slowly killing yourself by not having self control?	30
1	Because their "look at meeeeeeeeeeeeeeee" narcissism complex. They don't want to just work out. They want to be seen doing it so they can brag about it. Or just say, "see I exercise and don't lose weight" as they reward themselves with a trough of slop after a 30-second jog.	30
1	I'm sure by someone, somewhere, yes. Which isn't really fair to her considering she literally cannot help her disorder.  I have definitely seen uglier people than her. Slaton sisters, for one.	30
1	Here's some eyebleach on how you're supposed to age:  [Young](http://www.bizarrebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Paul-Newman-Shirtless.jpg)  [Middle Age](https://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9f193C1Dk1qlzjxwo1_500.jpg)  [Old](http://www.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/20080609/293.newman.paul.060908.jpg)	30

1	I read that but...  &gt; compares with the US average of 3,770 calories (15,800 kJ)  absolutely fucking disgusting.	30
1	&gt;Big boobs  Keep in mind, since this is a fatty, she's referring to large bra size, not to good shape.  [Male hams have this physical feature too](http://i.imgur.com/BHd5Dhx.jpg)--sagging fat folds on their chest larger than what you see on the hideous old crones of bare-breasted African tribes--it's not an indication of female curviness.	30
1	Just the top?  Just for a second, to see how it tastes?  Costco muffins don't have nutrition facts on them, but web sites report them at about 600-700 calories.  A McDonalds Big Mac is 530 calories.	30
1	Her name is Lizzie Velasquez. Poor girl. I can't imagine how hard her life must be. I've seen a couple of her videos on youtube, I think she was doing a make up tutorial? Nice to know that she's bringing some awareness to her condition.	30
1	This pic is pretty much /r/GuessThatGender gold.  He could pass for one of Judy Freespirit's radfem lesbiham colleagues.	30
1	That is super interesting. I may tell my friend this and see what happens, but I don't know anyone willing to eat butter on its own. :(	30
1	What the fuck was she dipping in the ranch?????? Bananas? Chocolate bats? A muffin? Was she eating it with a spoon?	30
1	"You look like a garbage bag of cottage cheese." Damn that is a good line.	30

1	10/10 poem, [she doesn't have anorexia though](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizzie_Vel%C3%A1squez), she has a rare condition that doesn't allow her to gain body fat. She has to eat all day in order to not die. The fat girl is her sister iirc, curse those genetics.	30

1	Is the Jeopardy thing true? If so, that's hilarious. Yay for shitlord Jeopardy writers!  Also, like nine out of ten of these hams live in spaces just as gross as their bodies. Lazy mind = lazy body = lazy cleaning habits.	30
1	Well, a [pretty fat baby](http://i.imgur.com/XHflkJc.png).	30
1	The Batman one doesn't even make any sense. It's extremely clear he pushes himself to mental and physical perfection with an iron will of determination, making him less bulging muscled makes him less Batman and that's a sin against humanity	30
1	What was the anger about? I mean I know I'd be irrationally angry without bread, pasta and potatoes, but was it something else?	30
1	Well it's a confirmation bias circle slurp:    1. Ignore the facts   2. Connect with other people ignoring facts   3. Tell each other HAES is real   4. Grow to planet size   5. Profit! (For the funeral home, in this case.)	30

1	Hey OP, I saw this fatty today too. It seems like you prefer the old gym to the new one as well.	30
1	I'm not 100% sure of this, but I think some vitamins can't be absorbed without food. I'm assuming this because every supplement I take has in its directions, "Take with food."	30
1	How could you think that eating stick upon stick of fucking *butter* would make you lose weight.	30
1	&gt;sellery  Banned for that spelling along with fat logic.	30
1	Cant wait for food to win again when this obese fuck has a heart attack.	30
1	You just don't get it--the food *forced* its way down their meaty gullets. It was literally rape.  ^^^((/s)^)	30
1	It is a disgusting ball glued to even bigger and more disgusting ball.	30
1	Because 60-70% of the developed world are selfish fat shits with no emotional intelligence.	30
1	Food was definitely an addiction for him, we all know he wasn't in a good place mentally. Addiction ran in his family but he probably didn't turn to alcohol since his father was an alcoholic so it was food.	30
1	If I'm stuck I just overestimate when I cut, and underestimate if I'm bulking.  That way I don't overeat when I'm trying to lose weight, or undereat when I'm trying to gain.	30

1	I came here to say this. Yesterday I had a fat day.   I had two chocolate bars, a premade sandwich and went out for an Italian amongst other things.   I ate 3,000 calories. I would literally have to put effort into eating 10,000 to the point where I wouldn't be able to work.	30
1	This is an extreme example, but I'll never understand people that go to name brand gyms, drop hundreds of dollars for training by someone that looks worse than they do.  Why would you take health advice from someone who isn't fit?	30

1	I fucking hate their bodies.	30
1	Who cares what is frowned upon on 4chan...	30
1	Love our glorious mods.	30
1	I think you have hit on a common thread with hamplanets that is their inability to gauge dimensions. They are always (inaccurately) comparing themselves to much thinner celebrities or beloved public figures. They also seem to grade their own fatness incorrectly by saying shit like "at least I'm not as fat as Tess Munster" (for example). Hams simply cannot be trusted with any form of measurement whether it be meal portions or dress sizes they always get it way off.	30

1	Yeah, she has a movie coming out about how she's no longer letting anyone online bully her. That's brave. To stand in front of hundreds if not thousands of people during a Ted^x talk and talk about her condition.  Take note fatties, this is what a condition looks like. She eats a lot of food and even with the help of doctors, still can't gain weight. It's taken it's toll on her body and functions. You're just lazy.	30
1	I think its supposed to be a palate cleanser during the meal(?) I'm not really sure, if its garnish its shitty.  Otherwise its literally a ranch dressing eating receptacle.	30
1	The rent in my parent's basement is pretty high. I guess they didn't even give me a discount. *looks out window* Whoa, I guess it's also on stilts.  So strange that the others who live here aren't even family.	30
1	You know what? Fuck it, get fat and disgusting. At least it'll be easier to differentiate the trash.	30
1	I remember having to help my dad load up a disabled uncle of mine in our care. He was born premature and with the umbilical cord around his neck back in the 50s. I remember that it took us around 4 minutes to load him up in all rides, simply because his body was so deformed and tight. Luckily, he was a normal weight. But I am sorry for holding up all those people at every ride :(	30
1	&gt; Leave those procedures for disabled people, not the morbidly obese.  Don't be sorry about your uncle. He didn't do it to himself. You are an amazing person to help him enjoy the attractions. You can go first in line for all I care.	30
1	That's really not funny.   Rule 3 warning.	30
1	Boom! Fattie getting roasted.	30
1	"little burnt, but they're still good"	30
1	That comment reads like it was posted by a fellow shitlord (without the obligatory */fatlogic*).	30
1	What a fucking waste of resources. This shit makes me sick. Those firefighters could be putting out fires and saving lives, but instead they're helping a fucking lazy ass piece of shit beached whale.	30
1	Shhh, "roasted" is a trigger-word.	30
1	Not to rain on your parade, OP. But he obviously has lost a decent amount of weight. Still a fat fuck, nonetheless.	30

1	"Ya hear that fatty? Drunk enough to fuck you is drunk enough for a stomach pump."	30
1	We should organize an FPH census.  I didn't go full shitlord until I had two sons of my own and I realized how fucked they'd be if I didn't crack down and start teaching them that gluttony is a sin.  I'm in my early 30's and I also own my own basement, which contains my own private home gym, which I use to be not fat.	30
1	Dressing up animals is cruel, release that thing back to the wild where it belongs!	30
1	I'm from the UK. We generally don't have basements. Also I haven't lived with my parents for 17 years (left when i was 16). Also I have my own house, a good job. a girlfriend, awesome pets, play sport 4 times a week and think the redpill is an utter cesspool of human failure.   :)	30
1	Not a doctor but I can hazard a guess. Probably for his gut flora. We have a lot of helpful bacteria in our bowels that help digest food and fight infection. They need sustenance as well.   These bacteria are so important that if you have a lack of them, doctors can do a fecal transplant.	30
1	Whoops I apologize. I clearly meant buttered, fried, baked, and fried again.	30

1	Yep, this sub has the most females I have seen on any sub.	30
1	I can't understand the mindset that would hire a fat guy to work at a gym.  It's like a neon sign reading "our workout plan doesn't actually work."  You don't want a girl with ugly nails working at a nail salon either.  If she can't do her own nails, why have her do mine?	30
1	Also an outstandingly high ratio of gay and trans people.	30
1	It gets worse - she was GIVEN the house (with the french doors 'for easy access') by the government - only after she was first 'rescued' from her parents house after they had to take out a wall to get her out of her bedroom... My mother is dying of dementia and the NHS cannot afford to pay for her care.  FUCK YOU FAT BITCH.	30
1	Bullshit, even if she grew a beard it wouldn't cover that mountain of fat she thinks is a chin.	30
1	Fat people ruin my rock hard cock.	30
1	that's just some fat idiot wearing a trainer shirt. people would laugh in his face if he tried to offer health or fitness advice. i'd rather visit a meth-head dentist.	30

1	What's wrong with its face, it looks like spongebob when he keeps saying "soiled it."	30
1	Fucking hambeasts and their goddamned angles. The work they'll put into hiding fat when they can just work toward losing it all together. Fucking astounding.	30
1	Like a big, buttery snowman.	30
1	Looks like she's getting prepared for her sad future.	30
1	A huge Obeast from the UK, there are a couple of topics on the front page of FPH about it as it was in the news yesterday	30
1	That one cracked me up.   A crane used to lift 1-ton bags of stone and shit can't even lift this bag of lard, so they have to get another that can lift cars.   No worry though, it being that fat doesn't effect anybody else!!! /s   It'll eat itself to death soon, hopefully.	30
1	No, thanks to Scooty Puff Jr's, they can ride all over town and get their tan on, teehee!	30
1	I can fit   in a laundry basket.	30
1	This is insane. How does the government so randomly choose to spend its resources. Spending thousands on this land whale who's *twice* shown zero regard for her own wellbeing, while those who can't afford their medication go without. Disgusting.	30
1	That's Meghan Trainers brother. It's all just a misunderstanding. Fat ass.	30

1	lol   *muh hair covers muh chins so on tinduh men can get tuh know muh persunahlituh*	30

1	he was most likely a mad fatty anyways, good riddance.	30

1	Oh man. There was a time when I watched the episodes with him being fat, and I thought he was still skinny. Jesus Christ.	30
1	I don't think he ever did have a heart attack. But he's lost some crazy weight and apparently eats vegan a lot now.	30
1	He's a food trainer	30
1	It's all about that easy, instant gratification.    In their pathetic, childish minds it's easier to spend hours doing makeup and posing in special ways to hide their fat (which they claim to be so proud of, still trying to figure that one out) than it is to eat less and move more.	30
1	Well, at least it's dressed appropriately.	30
1	Made me bust out laughing! But then I got sad. What a waste.	30
1	What. The. Fuck.	30

1	These people are unbelievable.  If you don't want to buy the product DON'T BUY THE FUCKING PRODUCT. Sick of these goddamned gender studies buzz words "ableist, sexist, racist." Then blowing this up to incident homeless and mentally ill people. Sorry femicunts,  the homeless and mentally ill have real problems.  These FAT entitled pigs need to just die of their pending heart attacks already and be done with it.	30
1	I can see it now, just rolling through Walmart spending the next 30 years of her life in that chair.	30

1	I agree with your letter.  &gt; So why then promote obesity.  They know why - 30% of the US is a large demographic. Anorexics are a small group. I found a small typo though:  &gt; they aren't choses  *choices.	30
1	If you look very closely at the last picture, you'll notice that she's leaning back slightly more.	30
1	Looks like she had 8 wisdom teeth pulled out, wtf.	30
1	It was the fried chicken's fault, it should have known not to be so delicious.	30
1	Why do they bother commenting on photos from a page called FITNESS GIRLS? You can hear the envy seething out out their mouths. They want to be her – but they can't, so they blame external factors.	30
1	Fucking fatties don't seem to understand resistive forces. Starvation mode is to CICO what drag is to velocity.  That is, it slows things down the more extreme the rate, but it's a minor contributing factor.	30
1	I feel like the "fatty used to bully me posts" are using obesity as a revenge tactic. Even in the case of bullies, I think we should all be telling people off for being fat, not telling them to be fat.	30
1	I have never wanted to slug a hamplanet so hard in my life. Ugh, the whole cutesy footsie pajamas thing to try and have a personality is gross...	30

Some hams on twitter gave him a lot of shit for promoting health and he lashed out at one pretty bad, saying some very naughty words and things. As a tv personality he can't act like that without affecting ratings so they cancelled his show and I haven't heard from him since.	30
1	I couldn't really make out what she was saying, but I figured she was talking about severe hypoxemia, oxygenation in the teens is very fucking serious, if that keeps up for any amount of time you are basically braindead. Makes sense in the way she is talking about her sister dieing.	30
1	... *fecal* transplant? Does that... is that what I think it is?	30
1	That posture kills the back	30
1	Go play in traffic.	30
1	There was a kid at my school who wasn't fat but absolutely adored gravy.  Every day at lunch when we had mashed potatoes, she would get extra gravy.  One time, she got a bowl with nothing but gravy in it and sat down to drink it.  One of the teachers thought we had bullied her into getting it and made her sit away from us.  She actually just really liked gravy and drank the whole thing.	30
1	Hold up what? I'm not sure I wanna know. But, what?	30
1	We love you mods.	30
1	Fat guys are so fucking insecure about being passed by a woman. I can't count the number of dudes with huge guts on fancy bikes who I'll be passing on a climb and immediately start saying stuff like "oh this is my first time riding this way" or "I've been riding for three hours already!" Lol, I don't give a fuck and trying to justify yourself to a total stranger who you'll only see for 15 seconds doesn't make you any less pathetic.	30
1	Why'd they tip that sofa up on its side for the picture?	30
1	Incest? Ok, i can deal with that, but aint no one comparing you to taylor swift. Thats were i draw the line!	30
1	Yeah O2 levels below 90% aren't very good either.  I love how her sister is begging for money because she's in the hospital. If these two creatures don't care about their health why should I?	30
1	[these things](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/I0vYPgKe6SYTd2RP-GgHWFkW_fVyQebMvgy60wcmwuWE-HsPZ4iLtT7R6mAGDxibQtkn_-mX6PpfjcImZlVcRtTuFA=w426-h240-n)  The one with more forehead fat is in ICU at the moment, getting excited hoping it dies.	30
1	But I'm so hungry all day long, patiently waiting for the next meal so I can eat a few lettuce leafs to calm down my hunger for 30 seconds before going back to starving (with my inferior gunetiks and cundishuns preventing starvashun mode from triggering) for the rest of the day.  I just wish I could be fat and eat greasy pizzaburgers at every meal and snack inbetween! And be able to hug someone's fupa!	30
1	Oh I know what those things are, I'm more concerned/horrified/about to fucking barf about the incest	30
1	Woah, her five head sticks out more than her nose does...	30
1	"Corpulence is not only a disease itself, but a harbringer of many." There we have it again; common sense from thousands of years ago.	30
1	aka "I need an excuse to eat more"	30
1	Oh my sweet summer child	30
1	I always thought the bucket is for people to share and not for one person alone.	30
1	You damn upper classes.	30
1	Take off your "black collar", Mr. High and mighty. /s	30
1	Not sure. If I had to guess, it had to do with genetics, second desserts, and being turned down at the suggestion of a quick shag.	30
1	Nah, training them to eat more, faster. I bet it really must be an art form to get that fat. You must need a lot of will power to continue eating while your body is begging you to stop.	30
1	Oprah doesn't know what weight she is anymore does she	30
1	Oh god, she was actually fucking beautiful before and now she's just a fat fuck	30
1	All this hatred for fat people. You're all just bullies, maybe she can't lose the weight did you ever think of that D:	30
1	Oprah is like old-school decadent aristocracy fat. She can buy/eat anything she wants whenever she wants. She'll just have her head cryogenically frozen when she dies and be reattached to a skinny body at a later date.	30
1	She had her hair up! with those arms that's quite an accomplishment goddamnit! /s	30
1	30? That's optimistic.	30
1	It's a troll account. It posts garbage like that all the time. Just like the one with the fat black girl where she claims she can't go anywhere because people think she's Rihanna...	30
1	The "there are no girls on the Internet" rule does not mean what you think it is. It means that pointing out that you are a female has no bearing on your posts and is only a cry for attention.  If being female is a key point in the story, it's not attention whoring, doubly so if they're fucking anonymous  Of course you probably only browse /b/ so you would have no idea	30
1	Has anyone actually confirmed this is true from a source other than her ham sister? Or is this a white trash stunt to get more money into the gofundme?	30
1	Stealth you must young shitlord.	30
1	Traits you are born with: Height, Bone structure  Traits you develop yourself: Weight, Muscle mass  Why is this so hard to understand?	30
1	Those patchy spots on her boobs are not giving me a good vibe.	30
1	But if you put hardbodies on a Protein World ad, everyone loses their mind.  Nobody is going to say, "oh, I'm OK you can spend my allocation of health care money on someone more needful."  Everybody will clamour for the state to coddle them, although that implicitly diverts money from everyone else who could have used it.  Oh wait, this is what healthy, non-obese people do every day.  We stay *out* of hospitals, don't require special care or medications.  By our actions we leave more money in the health care system for others.  Then fat disgusting slobs like this swoop in and use that money.	30
1	Sweet Jesus.  http://i.imgur.com/5l4Avrr.jpg  Looks like a kitten trying to crawl out of its mouth.	30
1	I believe the term "buttergolem" fits pretty well	30
1	Die already you fat cunt	30
1	That's quite the dystopic nightmare. I can see it now... shitlord internment camps as body farms for the privileged obese to use as disposable digestive tracts. The horror...	30
1	She broke a crane.	30
1	"'People make fun of me because I'm a drunk', and then people ask me what to do when I get insulted for being alcoholic. Other message me saying 'they wish they had the confidence but people call me a washed up drunkard'. You know what I tell them? These people are SOBER. So feed them a shot and give them a hug because they are the problem, not you. Let's go get a 40 together".  Does anyone else see the problem here?	30
1	"Nice clean bulk. Looking thick, solid, tight. Let us know your diet and routine."  hahahaha	30
1	She's 23? In human years?	30
1	I'm fine with this, hams get super ham....Get told their healthy......Hams steadily increase.......Heart attack at 48.	30
1	In enclosed settings, be aware of the location of emergency exits. In places like Texas, do a quick ocular pat-down to ensure that's really a chicken drumstick in their pocket and not a firearm. Other than that, if you can outpace a snail, you're perfectly safe.	30
1	The problem with her, and anyone who has had the unfortunate pleasure of seeing her on the god awful TV show she is on, is that she is just a horrible cunt who doesn't know how to be nice to anyone. So even when she was not a land-whale she was still probably a horrible person.  Then people probably worked out she was a cunt, and then she ate herself fat and now tries to push this shit on others by saying it's ok to be fat, opening a fat only shop and promoting her fat lifestyle.	30
1	Was coming in to say something about her hideous posture.... Did her mama never tell her to "straighten up"?!	30
1	If true beauty comes from inside maybe she should write a short story instead of posting her nasty ass tits online for the world to see.	30
1	I never really liked Bader until just now.	30
1	Yeah, that's nonsense. If anything, big dicks don't count on fatties because half of it is buried under their Fantastic Under-appreciated Personality Attributes.	30
1	if she'd gain 100lbs instead they would label her as "brave"	30
1	Can we kickstarter this movie plot? Please?	30
1	Have your tried eating butter? /s	30
1	Sure. Would it be better to disingenuously frame it as a crowd-funding campaign to purchase body transplants for the obese? Piggyback on Tammy Slaton's, perhaps?	30
1	No reals. Only feels.	30
1	Is it taking a picture with a taser?	30
1	Seriously. Bangs are her fucking *thing*.   That's like saying you look like Nick Offerman without a mustache.	30
1	Boobs are fatty tissue, but when youre egg shaped, the only room the fat has to go is into your titties and turns them into truck mudflaps.	30
1	[they're really fatting their way into a corner now.](http://readsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/10.jpg)	30
1	Yeah when I cut into your Buddha belly for an operation I'll just put away the five foot long scalpel blade and use a normal person one. And just hack away for hours until the fat ends.	30
1	It should be expected from people who have more than one neck. Simply take solace in the fact that you're going to outlive them by 20-35 years!	30
1	If you need to be that fucking coddled by your doctor, then why don't you do everyone a favor and STAY HOME AND DIE?  Fuck.	30
1	Hams are legit retarded.  Science says so.	30
1	I remember the whole brother fucker thing from a while ago, either on here or on fatlogic.  It's a fake account.	30
1	Thin privilege is not needing rescuing from your own fucking bed.	30
1	53 in hog years.	30
1	She first said it was to buy the triple-wide coffin. Triple. All I can think of is that video where people are trying to dynamite that whale carcass on a beach.	30
1	Do we dare awaken Gorlack the Terrible?	30
1	THIS POST IS NOT HELPING **ME**.  #MEMEMEMEME ME!	30
1	The silly part is people post on GW purely to display their physical attributes.  I can't see "true beauty" in a picture.   The ham needs to know she is fat, don't delude her with butter coddling statements about inner beauty.	30
1	I think the ground should be protected from fat people.  We stop ATVs from going on areas with potential native american heritage sites. We should stop fat people from walking on them too.	30
1	I'm a dick. I'm fucking glorious.	30
1	Why do they always lie about going to the gym? Do they really think they are fooling anyone?	30
1	This infuriates me to no end. I wasn't "born" with good luck or a body I'm happy with. I had zero muscle definition and was only skinny because I didn't realize I underate. I didn't shape my white girl ass by shrugging at the squat rack, and I didn't get my calves from saying a litany of Hail Marys.	30
1	This is downright terrifying. "Please enable me by not bringing any of my health problems to my attention and also, please treat me like a thin person who also doesn't have health problems because that's who I actually want to be."	30
1	People laugh at both too.	30
1	Fuck em, girl is ripped and should gives no fucks on what sub human Hambeasts think.	30
1	No, it's even *worse* than that. They've gone past blaming external factors and convinced themselves they *are* fit. It...it boggles the mind.	30
1	Not surprising. Have a read over at r/progresspics. Losing 5lb is upvoted to the moon while any progress pic worth applauding is shot down.   i despise the I don't like girls with abs argument.	30
1	Are these people retarded or something, anorexia doesn't mean just no fat, it also means you have next to no muscle mass. She has pretty decent muscle mass if you ask me. These people are fucking dumb and don't understand what healthy actually is!	30
1	If a patient ever hands me one of these I'm going to lose my fucking mind.	30
1	&gt;"Girls that ripped aren't attractive"  I just ran that through the Hamslator and it actually was trying to say  &gt; "Girls that ripped are so far out of my league I need to drag them back down"	30
1	Im just guessing they are inbred from them displaying the usual characteristics of such unfortunate births.	30
1	I don't think people understand you're being sarcastic.	30
1	She looks perfectly fine to me on the left picture, but holy fuck that's a great body on the right!	30
1	This is just fucking sad. She's essentially ended her life before it's even begun. You're twenty fucking one. You're supposed to be in your prime. You're supposed to be living life and having new experiences, but instead you traded YOUR BASIC FUCKING MOBILITY for a few double cheeseburgers and cake.  Pathetic.	30
1	Being a goth when I was younger has paid off...	30
1	I just don't understand what the fuck it would cost them to just say "Hey, good for you! I'm working on a degree and it's a bitch. Your lifestyle isn't for me but I understand working hard for a goal. Keep kicking ass!". Is it really that taxing to be supportive to other people?	30
1	Well, it's in the name. It's the reason why they don't want fit people or body builders. They want fatties to turn into planets. GET FIT INTO PLANET MODE.	30
1	My eyebrows actually shot up when I saw how far the brush went in. Fuck.	30
1	Not muh internet points D:	30
1	I like 'waddling dead'	30
1	I want to believe...actually [nevermind](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m83tks6Fjr1rys4czo1_500.gif).	30
1	Well, it's through a computer screen. Cowardice as always.	30
1	She said in the comments that she was battling depression and this was her outlet...you know, the complete opposite of chugging a box of twinkies. Fat and depressed gets you support but fit and depressed gets you hate? Christ, these people suck.	30
1	Yes, it burns precious calories to be supportive.	30
1	Spoiler alert, you fucking mongoloid:  Someone a 4th of your fucking size isn't going to have the same physical needs that you do.  Do all Vet clinics care for farm animals the same way they care for cats and dogs? No? There is a reason for that.	30
1	I can just picture the look on the crane operator's face, when the paramedics were telling him what he was about to do. "U wot mate?"	30
1	And charge for every second..... "Yes, Sir.  The new Benz over there.  I'll take it."	30
1	Look at the upside, the scooty puff will shave years off her life.	30
1	Fuck you shitlord, all farts are beautiful. #effyourfartstandards.	30
1	"In stills false body image"  First of all it's *instills* you fucking lard. And second, how is a **real** unphotoshopped girl instilling anything false??	30
1	Perfect, I was looking for a tent to hold the reception party.	30
1	Yeah, one of those things is just unnatural.	30
1	From the article, "The operation to cut into her home, which came after she telephoned her mother to say she couldn't stand up, cost emergency workers an estimated £100,000. "   That's the cost of getting her out of her home ONE FUCKING TIME.	30
1	Well, bangs and cameltoe.  I'm sure if you stuck the blubberfuck in OP's pic in some sweat pants it would look like she's giving birth to a set of dually truck tires, so maybe she just seriously misunderstood the comparison someone made.	30
1	Fuck, I only get one standard-sized firefighter to throw me over his shoulder and remove me from harm's way.  Fat privilege is getting a entire squad of public servants at one's beck and call for no reason other than your tremendous sloth and gluttony.	30
1	What I find even more infuriating is that THIS is actually the hard part of weight loss. Those last few pounds and last few % of body fat that take you from healthy normal to fitness poster lvl. Anything before that is piss easy in comparison.  But no, let's all congratulate the ham who lost 50 pounds and went from morbidly obese to obese instead ...	30
1	Does it matter? I mean, what's it gonna do? Chase you?	30
1	Thanks.  Mostly the shit that comes out of my mouth is dumb... But for some reason when I have a few beers all of a sudden I'm Winston-Fucking-Churchill.	30
1	They should have just shot the damn thing and used chainsaws to bring it out in pieces.	30
1	Respect my personalituh!!!	30
1	"The operation to cut into her home, which came after she telephoned her mother to say she couldn't stand up, cost emergency workers an estimated £100,000."  Tens of thousands? Pshh	30
1	it's a troll account	30
1	AH! Success!  Now celebratory cake!	30
1	Haha F.U.P.A You are clever	30
1	Not to be a dick or anything, but if you want someone to take you seriously in the real world, especially a publisher, you need to proof read what you write before you send it. There are numerous errors and it completely destroys the credibility of a great message.   Just a heads up.	30
1	[Oh no,  whatever shall you do!?] ( http://i.imgur.com/eobnIKK)	30
1	But you just need to read the bumps on her areolas to see her personality. Kinda like palm reading.	30
1	"Now, a good technique is to get two burgers, put one on top of the other, squash them, and then eat it. Double the protein!"	30
1	everything sticks out more than her nose does	30
1	that ensures employment at hooters though right?	30
1	And coddle them when they relapse.	30
1	Emergency services should just show up with a captive bolt gun for shit like this. And then the guys from men in black who torch everything.	30
1	How sexy and healthy do the arms in the eyebleach look? and they don't look butch or whatever the hams claim fit womens muscular arms look! I'm working on my arms atm and would be mad happy to have arms half so good! &lt;3 to my hot armed shitfamily	30
1	Still using too many resources. The individual and the enablers got it that way, they should be barricaded in until they either die or get themselves to a human size.	30
1	They are projecting their insecurities, the same way we project our hate.	30
1	I bet it sounded just like bacon hitting a hot pan.	30
1	That makes my blood boil. My mother went blind in her 40s and still had to pay her own rent and bills. Government gave her nothing and she wasn't a burden on society like these parasitic hams are. That's horrible. I don't want my tax dollars to keep paying for your triple bypasses.	30
1	Like anyone cares what fat people find attractive, scoob.   Spoiler alert: it's a large pizza to themselves.   Jinkies!	30
1	I still don't think she would qualify because her forehead would prevent her breasts from touching the wall.	30
1	To see shitlords uniting against a common foe.... The feels.	30
1	Even if she isn't disgusting on the inside too, it's really challenging to rub one out to someone's kindness and charitable work.	30
1	Look at the facial structure of people with fetal alcohol syndrome and then look at their faces. It was a drunken incest party.	30
1	"Hey man your getting kinda big, shouldn't you tone down on the eating?"  "B-b-b-b-b-b-bro y-y-y-y-y-you just don't understand, I'm bulking and making gains you fuking manlet."  lol	30
1	Can confirm - Strength training is super good for depression and anxiety.    Also can confirm - The crabs in that particular bucket really don't like it when you're not into wallowing in your misery with them.   Edit:  That's why I won't do group counseling ever again.  If you're having success at actually fixing your problems, *especially* by making physical health a big part of your life, you're treated like a hideous traitor IME.	30
1	No stop that  Banned  -CAW	30
1	"Anorexic... " "not attractive" Lord, help me, I want to track these people down and punch them all. That woman looks amazing. It's very difficult to get abs that defined and damn, she worked hard for it. I don't know why they keep saying she looks like she HASNT eaten, considering you need to eat twice as much to get that much muscle. Wtf. Fat logic.	30
1	That's true. So maybe shitlords just go cut the pizza line and board the place up. We can cheap out on materials not like they have any muscle left.	30
1	I have a subtle shitlord adopted grandma. She's my absolute favorite person and I want to be her. Some teenagers were trying on clothes for prom and she turns to the fat one and said, "it's all right dear, there's a beautiful woman in there...somewhere"	30
1	People who shit on women that work out are always incredibly envious of their bodies. You can taste their tears of rage.	30
1	Dude they're not fat. They're cultivating mass.	30
1	being irish is working out nicely for me	30
1	MUH CURVES, MUH FEELS, TACO BELL	30
1	Look at the "I'm so kyoot" twinkle eyes too. How to make a punchable face 101.	30
1	He looks like he can lift a lot, of forks and spoons with food on into his mouth.  Fat fuck	30
1	Maaaaaaaaaybe you should start using the "/s" tag   EDIT: "sarcasm" via text isn't super obvious to some, haha. But seeing that they're verified should give it away.	30
1	[...](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/clint_ew.gif)	30
1	But that ruins the fun c:	30
1	I don't know, I looked at his flair and his username and I thought it was glaringly obvious he was being sarcastic.	30
1	One of the nicest women I know posed for playboy.   What's funny is the hams  and ham defender's who talk about real beauty just assume they are better on the inside because they are ugly on the outside.   It does not work that way.	30
1	This post is about as clear an illustration of the 'crab' mentality as you could hope for.	30
1	I just heard in my head "Won't get up and walk to the store? That's a paddlin..."	30
1	A fit woman with arms like that in an evening gown can be absolutely breathtaking.  Keep it up!	30
1	Looked like that hurt quite a bit, but why the fuck was she jumping in flip flops? Why was she jumping over a firepit at all?	30
1	As a southerner I can guarantee you that there sadly are people this dumb/gross out there.	30
1	What fucking evidence is this bullshit based off of?    "Don't weigh me unless necessary and don't tell me the number"   *closes ears* lalalalalalalalala	30
1	This is from her [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizzie_Vel%C3%A1squez)  &gt;Her daily energy intake of about 5,000 calories compares with the US average of 3,770 calories   Omfg the US average is 3770 calories?	30
1	"Fat" tits, and your friend looks like overcooked bacon.  You're both disgusting failures, so suck a crackhead's dick and stay off public shit.	30
1	Ug... This post ruined my morning. So much rage  It is just so depressing that fat logic runs that deep.	30
1	&gt;people who work out  FTFY	30
1	God damn is Oprah ugly.	30
1	"Wah... Wah... This girl is fit, looks good and I'm still a fat fucking waster. Let's all be really negative." I hate hate hate Ham logic.	30
1	This is no dank meme :/	30
1	These idiots have no idea how to eat to nourish their bodies. They eat to numb the pain of looking like a sack of wet sand.   That chick is ripped! Well compared to me anyway. And I find her before and after truly inspiring. I should probably go over to that sub and share some well deserved upvotes if true progress gets voted down.	30
1	It's cool. I just find that for some reason women get shitted on a lot for muscles because fatties and other idiots think muscles aren't sexy on a woman. They're so dumb. I appreciate anyone who dedicates themselves to their work out. I look to them for inspiration at the gym.	30
1	She's right.  I sold my tractor with the front loader years ago.	30
1	&gt;your friend looks like overcooked bacon.   So fucking accurate. 😂	30
1	"She looks ill in the 2nd pic"? Ill compared to what, the panniculus you're baking under your pants there?	30
1	True beauty come from inside? Written in fucking gonewild. What the fuck.	30
1	For those curious, here are the Slaton sisters eating marshmallows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsT9_VSaEHA&amp;t=41	30
1	Because REAL women have currrrves.	30
1	It's amazing how accurate you can be when you don't have your own gravitational pull throwing the Earth's balance off and shit.	30
1	Definitely a huge waste of resources but I think half those professionals only showed up to witness the freak show. At the very least, 7 cops (assuming they don't travel in pairs) were likely not necessary to this operation. I know I'd want to watch but then again, I leave no shady link on the internet unturned so I'm not the best source.	30
1	Have we entered another dimension that no one else but us is noticing? I am terrified for the future.	30
1	That other girls eye-liner is running away from the flab	30
1	&gt;  slaton sisters   [OMG.](https://youtu.be/eTlb7s1hP0s?t=1686) Is it coincidence that they moved themselves on the 24th and on the 25th there was an earthquake in Nepal? Maybe not.	30
1	That weight kills her entire skeletal system.   I heard a landwhale complaining about their back one day and about how they don't understand why it hurts so badly. I was just awestruck that someone could be that fat and stupid at the time, I've learned a lot from that day though.   I hope to live in a world one day soon that fats don't get treatment for something that someone else needs more because of something they can't control, like height or an actual disease.	30
1	&gt;true beauty comes from the inside  Said while jerking it to pictures of women’s naked bodies.   Hmmm, something doesn’t quite add up here.	30
1	You almost had me there for a second.	30
1	I love how any sign of muscle definition is "anorexia" to fat fucks.	30
1	That girl looks great and has the confidence to post a pic without any tricky angles.  Obeasts are straight up jelly.	30
1	Lol, I can just imagine the ham sitting down and handing this card to their doctor, as the Doc’s head sinks to her chest and lets out a deep sigh. “Ffs”.	30
1	SHE'S TOO FUCKING FAT TO BREATHE  HOW IS MONEY GOING TO HELP THAT	30
1	Oh wow.. never in my life have I seen arms like the "wittle walrus" one.  Her fucking forearms look almost as big as my thighs.	30
1	"black skin collar". LOL	30
1	Right? Because clearly she's toning her body for some fat genderless blob who "doesn't find abs attractive"	30
1	Jumping with flip flops over a fire pit isn't really hard, it's just that she fucking sucks at jumping.	30
1	Exactly. I consider it a civic responsibility to use as few public resources as I possibly can so they can be available for people who truly need them. That's why obesity is so fucking selfish. They know they're going to end up needing a disproportionate share of medical resources, but they just don't give a fuck.	30
1	Hopefully the love towards our sub is growing and our message is spreading.	30
1	when the fuck did 3,770 become average?? I can barely do 1,500 a day.	30
1	100 thousand pounds?  That's got to be like a million American dollars right?    They should do what we do with idiots who go down the Grand Canyon trails without water and need rescue -- you're paying the government back or we take everything you have.	30
1	"Hahaha, Jim, Brent you guys gotta get down here and see this shit... THEY HAD TO REMOVE THE DOORS. That's it, crimes off, get the precinct down here."	30
1	Please file your complaint with our Customer Service Department.	30
1	Well, I would rather cut my dick in two than fuck a fat fuck.	30
1	They have her on an IV of mayonnaise to sustain her.	30
1	&gt; They want to be her – but they can't  Worse. They want to be her and they can but they choose to keep piling food into the gaping eating chasm in their lard.	30
1	Her legs used to be kinda awesome.   What the hell.   Why would you do that to yourself? For extra McDonalds?	30
1	i had an argument on Yik Yak recently about how unless you have a flat tummy you can call them big tits.  If you're tummy is fat, your body is fat, and your tits are fat.  Fat does not equal big, it equals fat.	30
1	How low have we come where muscle and fitness is negative? What the fuck people?	30
1	Are you able to refuse patients?  If not, can you refer them for a psychiatric evaluation?	30
1	problem is that it takes until theyre 48 to kill themselves off.  28 would be a much better number.	30
1	You mean minutes right?	30
1	Marshmallow Fluff sisters eating their own kind. That's cannibalism!	30
1	They had to close the street so some additional police were probably used to direct traffic.	30
1	&gt;Taylor swifts cameltoe  Well I'm off to google images then.	30
1	&gt;forehead fat  Never thought I'd hear of such a thing. Wish I'd never *seen* such a thing.	30
1	Girls with abs are so fucking hot. These thin-shaming lardasses have a lot to answer for.	30
1	Really? I was on a 1500 cal diet for 1 month and I was starving all day	30
1	I bet it smelled just like bacon hitting a hot pan too. Bacon and B.O.	30
1	Looks like she's finally burning some calories	30
1	Yeah, but hams would be outraged if a fit girl wrote "I'm thin and have little body fat, which is an automatic swipe right."	30
1	Abs are the real curves goddammit( ´∀｀)	30
1	People like this are everywhere. I don't see a reason to point out you are from the south.	30
1	Moist memes can't burn steel calories.	30
1	Fatties still rubbed one out to those abs, I am sure. The cognitive dissonance must be crazy.	30
1	You can be obvious, but do remember if they decide to chase you, [DO NOT RUN DOWN HILL!](http://38.media.tumblr.com/094116ee7cf398e9391cbef4325a94a7/tumblr_mzh4chYBT11s2wio8o4_400.gif)	30
1	Nah, hamplanets usually love buff guys. As much as it defies logic though.	30
1	"GET THIS BEAST 5 CC'S OF MAYO, STAT!"	30
1	Last girl I dated was the first one who was truly sporting a nice set of abs. That shit was incredibly hot.	30
1	"Madam, I may be drunk, but in the morning I will be sober and you will still be a landwhale."	30
1	Nobody can be stupid enough to really believe being fat is healthier than being fit or a normal weight. That's the fatties lying to themselves.	30
1	Brutal. I love it.	30
1	Because losers hate winners.	30
1	Not to mention how much harder it is to lose weight when you have less to lose (and keep the muscle you've earned). When you're holding 100 extra donut pounds, of course that shit comes off easily.	30
1	They're referring to a study or two that was carefully designed to give these results; If you don't adjust for smokers and the severely sick (like cancer patients) it is possible to get results that show that it is healthier to be barely in an overweight BMI than the middle of a normal one, but even in these misleading studies there's still no question being obese is worse.	30
1	Is that photoshopped? My brain cannot accept this.	30
1	Can second that Strength training is phenomenal in battling depression and anxiety. Can also second that physical health is overlooked and seconded to other less effective methods of recovery.   I tried several depression medications available in the UK (Citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine) and each one led to me feeling worse and relapsing into drinking. You know what worked best? Fucking Bodybuilding mate. Walking, cycling. Anything and everything physical. No excuses, get that blood flowing, stop pitying yourself and looking for sympathy, just earn your callouses and feel better at last.   Oh and put down the takeaways you rotten ham-blimps.	30
1	Best analogy. I used to work in the veterinary field, can confirm. Even dogs were treated differently based on their size, and they're the same species (ex. Chihuahua vs. Doberman). Obese cats and dogs are treated differently than their normal-weight counterparts, and we used to hound the owners about it just as badly.	30
1	"OMG! Eat a sandwich! You're not a real woman!" - Jealous Fat Girl	30
1	Why yes, my huge, visible cock does take up a large percentage of my body weight. /lies.	30
1	Does it not list her weight? Or is her fat thumb covering that up too	30
1	The butterfly...er...butterplanet effect.	30
1	I believe you mean pessimistic. Fuck having that alive for another 30 years.	30
1	I...I...can't even	30
1	Born in 1991? She looks 40.	30
1	I couldn't, but I can see how others might. Just look at great sports coaches. They don't have to be anywhere near great physical shape in order to get their team in shape.  If they're saying "I can get you in shape", that's far different from "Do what I do and you'll be in great shape".	30
1	Holy Shit. I didn't think that was possible.	30
1	&gt;I love every ounce of her sexy fucking ass  I think they meant pound.	30
1	I'd rather have a personality made of cocks than one made of globules of rancid cheese meat. Cocks are awesome, having boiled chickens for upper arms isn't.	30
1	"No one wants to with cuddle sharp bones that will poke you," says guys who have never touched a fit woman in their entire life.  I dated a girl who did triathlons. Her butt was arguably the greatest thing I've ever laid my hands on.	30
1	&gt;But please realize your place in my life. *Nowhere*  TUMBLR REkT	30
1	I got to "every roll on her stomach" and stopped. Stomachs should be flat, not "rolled."   Flat and/or abs &gt; Rolls	30
1	Look at that, science proving fatties wrong.  Patriarchy, all of it!	30
1	This was very clearly crafted by an undercover ham.	30
1	What the fuck is that costume? She looks like a squidbilly	30
1	2 points, actually. Not being a ham made it so you also didn't get the urge to steal and eat what was probably half a tray of brownies... WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING THEY WERE DRUGGED. Like I might understand knowing they were pot brownies and stealing them, but... Wow. And even then, wow...	30
1	Pinot noir, mid-sized car.	30
1	"Consider prescribing the same things that you would to a thin person with the same problem"  Thin people aren't fat, so necessarily doctors can't prescribe the same treatments	30
1	yeah, I love that argument.  the kind of fats we see in the 21st century would have been fucking circus freaks 50 years ago.	30
1	Omg if my boyfriend every proudly exclaimed to "whack it" to me every night I'd be embarrassed. Then again I tend to date people who exist and aren't self-conscious of me	30
1	"I prefer seeing people..."  "I prefer..."  Seriously?  This isn't a progress pic menu.  Progress pics aren't intended for fat people to feel okay about being fat.  Progress pics are for people who are proud of... you know... their progress...  Fuck those fatties.	30
1	Iron supplements got me off the meds.   Taken in barbell form.  :-)  I'm also a chick, so I got a heaping side platter of "Ew, you're going to get bulky.  Ew, men don't like girls who are huge," bullshit.  I'm half your size, bitches, what is this "bulk" you're referring to?	30
1	Always gotta have something in their mouths, don't they?	30
1	Yep and it has been suspended	30
1	I have abs because I want a strong core, not to turn on some fat fuck on tumblr.	30
1	I just saw Nick Offerman live. He doesn't have his mustache anymore. Everyone in the audience boo'd him when Megan Mullaney brought it up.   Edit: [Found this picture of him](https://i.imgur.com/eOkVZ.jpg) without his mustache. He has also lost a bit of weight, so he doesn't look much like "Ron Swanson" anymore.	30
1	It's a portable table top guys! Plenty of room to fit three orders of Big Macs plus the super sized diet coke	30
1	Fatties don't actually know what anorexia looks like.	30
1	Don't know what Pennsylvania does, but a lot of state licenses no longer include weight. Too many fat people bitching about it I guess.	30
1	Whereas skinny people can just live their lives.	30
1	oprah is all about loving yourself for who you are and accepting your flaws and shit like that.  she then proceeds to photoshop herself to death to make her look less like a ham every issue of O magazine.  she's a narcissist piece of shit	30
1	Rippling abs = anorexic now.  Got it.	30
1	&gt;Which do you think men prefer?  Uh....the one that looks like it takes care of itself? Why isn't this the natural preference for everyone?	30
1	" I'd mourn the loss of my boobs rather than celebrate having a flat stomach." Bitch, flat stomachs are *earned*. Boobs are not. I mean unless you paid for implants. Also I think she's still fat at a size 10.	30
1	Is this one of those "reject them before they reject me" things? It's gotta be.	30
1	They don't know what a normal body looks like anymore, of course they have no idea what real anorexia nervosa is.	30
1	And her hair is up now. It's the subtle differences	30
1	Did you actually read the article? The third sentence says that any "escape" from the hazards of obesity is temporary.	30
1	lol at the "no smoking sign". Hurr durr smoking is bad for your health, I can't stand smokers, they're so selfish, etc.  Just the same as being obese.	30
1	What's this \#wearethethey bullshit I've been seeing lately? Do I even want to know?	30
1	You know those tights they make the girls wear? I am positive that if they put those tights on and walked through the restaurant, there would be a squishing sound with each step. I can hear it in my head.	30
1	yeah cuz there is no room left because of "his" fat gf	30
1	Why is this cunt so important that this has to be done? No, seriously, what made someone say "WE HAZ OBLIGATION TO THIS FOOD ADDICT"??!	30
1	But everything they post is to help ME, right?  Enough about me. What do you think about me?	30
1	Seems about right. She should age out in a few years, but at only 29 she will never collect her pension.   Then what? Welfare?	30
1	"This doesn't inspire me."  To fucking what?  If you need to look at pictures of fat women getting toned just so you have the "inspiration" to do something, you probably weren't going to do it in the first place.  Just fucking do it.  So you're uncomfortable a couple hours a day.  WHO FUCKING CARES, IT ADDS YEARS TO YOUR LIFE INSTEAD OF TAKING THEM AWAY!!!!!  Jesus fucking Christ it's too early for this shit.  I'm going back to bed.	30
1	Now to find an automobile that will support my weight	30
1	Holy shit someone should invent a Hamslator	30
1	Because everyone in this world is too worried about what is "right" bullshit. People can't handle having their feelings hurt so we "must" adapt to their feelings to make them feel better...   I hate this logic with a passion	30
1	"I'm fat and proud"  translation  "I'm lazy and gave up on improving my health and physical form. Deal with it."	30
1	Bing is better for such purposes.	30
1	~~The Shining~~ The Frying  ~~Bag of Bones~~ Bag of Lard  ~~The Long Walk~~ No Walk  ~~The Stand~~ The I Can Barely Stand  ~~Despiration~~ Perspiration  ~~It~~ It  ~~The Running Man~~ Hahahaha I can't finish that one.	30
1	She was lucky to be born with such great bone structure, but she has worked hard for that body. And at that level of fitness, she probably does have a burger sometimes, just not six of them in one sitting. Rage.	30
1	"Shit it's not working! 25CC's of Miracle Whip IV push NOW!"	30
1	those were the first things I noticed once the oompa loompa shock wore off.  yeah, that melanoma is just itching to explode.	30
1	Even your username is pretty annoying.  Can we get some bots to filter this shit out please? Ban the fatties before they can post.	30
1	Bonus: you bet your fucking arse the OP is this chick: http://imgur.com/1c7WPyS	30
1	Benned for fat sympathy.  Only you can prevent ham confidence, and you failed.	30
1	One does not simply get abs by being anorexic…	30
1	&gt; maybe but being healthy and fat IS possible,   Oh jeez.  Banned.	30
1	This is what our society has turned into: She's proud of her complete lack of effort. She's proud of consuming more than she requires. She's proud of something I would be ashamed of.	30
1	I'm a hetero lady, but I would go sapphic for Helen Mirren.	30
1	Benned for fat sympathy.	30
1	[Found one](http://imgur.com/GfLpJpR)	30
1	They think they're edgy and can hide shit by cursing so explicitly.   "There's nothing you can say/do to make a double chin attractive, so let's put a few F bombs to distract the person and maybe they'll nod in agreement!" teehee	30
1	*slow clap for unconventional shitlording*  Assuming he escaped, it was probably the only exercise he got all day.	30
1	Youre truly stupid. Just read the conclusion.	30
1	Well, not normally.  But there are ham chasers out there.  How does that make you feel?  The only guys who want you are "feeder fetishists"	30
1	Yes. And voting in subs you're not subscribed to is also against the site rules (most ridiculous rule I've ever heard but it's there).	30
1	"I'm happy and healthy, just never tell me my actual weight unless I ask".  Seriously.	30
1	Fortunately it's pretty easy to see the undercover hams since there aren't enough covers to actually conceal them.	30
1	Why is that? I know it's true... But why?	30
1	Wow, totally thought the title was paraphrasing her. Fucking nope.	30
1	I'd imagine it was something like Emma Watson cutting off all her hair after the last movie. He was just ready.	30
1	THIS. THIS IS WHY I HATE FAT PEOPLE.  It's even worse when this type of shit happens in Canada, because the bill is payed for by the taxpayers. When obese people require medical treatment, it offends me personally that *I* am financially responsible for it. I have a mortgage to pay and a kid to raise, I really don't want to have to pay for some fatass to get medical care when it's their own fault they need care in the first place. I wish fat people would just die instead of wasting my money and resources. It *really* makes me angry.	30
1	Fucking fatties should be considered a crime against nature.	30
1	I don't think there are actually fatties that go see doctors with cards like that, it'd be mental. We have had some pt get upset when talking about their weight, but most just ignore it. Depending on what procedure we did we now by default get post op psych consults on deathfats.	30
1	Tearing down other women is absolute bullshit and these are the women that call themselves feminists.	30
1	Is tinder for just hooking up or is it something like Match? Either way, if your greatest asset is your tits, chances are you're probably an idiot and believe everything at face value. gtfo and read a book ffs.	30
1	Even that is an excuse though. What it truthfully boils down to is priorities. Someone may prioritize going to school over their physical fitness, but if it's truly important to them, they'll make the sacrifices necessary to get the body they want. It doesn't take that much time, just some dietary management and 4 or so hours a week.   These people aren't choosing school or work or anything over their fitness besides their comfort. The only thing necessary to get stronger, leaner, and fitter is some planned discomfort, but for many people that is too high a cost.	30
1	"None of my thin patients have actual pieces of hamburger in their bloodstream, so do you mind if I be the Dr. here and you be the patient?"	30
1	Not gonna lie, I'm a bit envious. Haha  Yeah, those guys who have never been with anything other than a lard ass, because no woman with real standards will sleep with them are so obvious.	30
1	These things don't even look human. They look like those Vogon things from Hitchhiker's.	30
1	There is not a chance that was written by a man.    Nope. None.  Zip.  Zilch.  Nada.	30
1	It was written by a *real* man teehee!	30
1	[This one](http://i.imgur.com/GUsITtM.jpg) continue to baffle me. She has no wrists. How are her hands able to turn? there's a feet wide sleeve of fat covering her joint. That is horrifying.	30
1	real women don't have muscles. or feet, discernible limbs or any other human features, the ability to move, eyes that aren't obstructed by forehead fat and of course, boyfriends.	30
1	Im starting to think you can measure retardation as a body fat percentage. More fat = more retardation.	30
1	The walrus one, DAMN.  HOW.  She looks like [Kristen Wiig in the SNL sketch with the baby hands.](http://i.imgur.com/YJu6xgJ.jpg)	30
1	I was about to call you a stupid fat whore, but then I saw you're actually a potato hitler.	30
1	yeah, it so unattainable, which is how she achieved i....oh.	30
1	I have more curves than them, I'm a guy. I have more than one continuous curve.	30
1	"Loose"is the other one that gets me. Like when they TRY to say lose weight. Instead they say loose. Like their bodies. It happens all the time too.	30
1	That's fucking retarded. It's like shaming people for being rich.	30
1	She looks like Pumbaa from The Lion King	30
1	My goal is to seriously get some abs before my wedding. I am lusting after a nice pair for myself. (...that was worded a bit weird) But I think it's great to see more women lifting weights. I love the feel of it personally -- grunting and getting sweaty. Good thing I don't go to Planet Fitness.	30
1	I get the same thing.  I'm within the normal band for healthy BMI, but everybody is incredulous when I tell them I want to lose weight.    I get it, "normal" is now skewed towards people who are porky.  But I know I've let myself go a little bit.  Some of my old pants don't fit me any more.  I could just blow it off, but I'd rather get leaner.	30
1	Hardbodies aren't my personal preference, but of course they look good and earn my respect for their discipline and dedication. These complainers are so self-centered, where if they can't relate it must be bad. Don't they know it takes more discipline to lose weight at lower weights? Its very respectable and should be more inspiring than going from fat to chubby.	30
1	Assuming she was "born" with that body.....it still requires maintenance. It still requires self control. It wouldn't look like that if she stuffed her fat face with Big Mac 24/7. She is still more disciplined and fit than any fat ass.   And come on, she wasn't "born" with that body. She worked for it.	30
1	What are you talking about? Orange soda has fruit in it and it def doesn't make you fat, especially if you get DIET Orange soda.	30
1	There's some wishful thinking. Shame it won't tell her when people swipe left.	30
1	&gt;hot  &gt;double chins and neck fat  Pick one.	30
1	Jesus Fucking Christ.  Fine.  Here's the same amount of anesthetic that I would give a person half your weight.  Oh you woke up half way through surgery?  Well you asked me to consider using the same kind of medicine I would for a skinny person.  Sorry about that.  I guess your weight plays a HUGE role in how a doctor will treat you.	30
1	Yeah. Megan commented on how she always had to kiss that mustache, and Nick said "Fuck you guys. That's my face you are booing."  It was a great show. It's titled "Summer of 69; No apostrophe".	30
1	The guys at the construction site down the road won't let me borrow their crane :(	30
1	Because they want to believe that they're somehow more healthy than them. Every skinny/fit girl I know has been accused of being anorexic and told to 'eat a sandwich' and other such shit by fats. That type of thing follows them from junior high all the way to college and the workplace.	30
1	It's definitely all about preferences. I can understand that. Just so sick of these fatties who want to shit on every woman who isn't over 200 pounds.   How dare you work out and stay fit! You're just giving into society's ideals of beauty! SO UNREALISTIC.	30
1	Seriously? That's utter bullshit.	30
1	She IS the mass effect.	30
1	Oh Jayzus! It looks like her boobs have the skin from a 65 year old farmer.	30
1	At the party I told everyone who had something negative to say, that's this isn't about or for you.  This is for me.  I want to be healthy. I want to be toned and strong.  I am doing this for myself; you don't have to understand or like it.	30
1	That's a sturdy fucking chair.	30
1	All the time when someone points out that sex with obese people would be really disgusting and impractical, the retort is often "you just have a small dick!"  So this obeast now wants to disqualify some of her big-dicked suitors because she thinks their personality might not be pleasant enough.   Face the facts - anyone interested in exposing their dick to her is already a crazy fat fetishist.  She shouldn't be picky about personality, especially if she requires rare men with huge dicks to probe past her fat folds into her ladyparts.	30
1	Healthy At Every Mechanical Failure!	30
1	They don't have the time because their spare time is spent eating. You and I go to the gym, make time for it, balance everything else we do in life.   Fat people just eat. That's their primary concern. What's for lunch, snack, lunch 2, dinner, snack, dinner 2.   They have the same 24 hours in a day we do.	30
1	Flawed logic. I am a huge dick in terms of personality, but my penis is actually pretty small.	30
1	She looks big in both...	30
1	There's dickbutt. Then there's boobsbutt.	30
1	Fatrage has to be hidden behind something. Usually its claims of being triggered, oppressed or shamed. Its nice to see them being honest for once (jealousy).	30
1	That's a guy- look at the tits	30
1	UK size 10 is a 6 in the US I believe	30
1	She does look pretty ill in that second picture. Dope and fly, too, if you ask me.	30
1	So now they need:  1. 6'+ in height 2. Funny/good personality 3. Larger-than average penis 4. Guy who can *handle curves*  Well, good luck with that fatties.	30
1	This is *after* she moved into a new, government-provided house that was supposed to be easier to pull her out of.  Her previous extrication took 8 hours.  In this special apartment they got the time down to 7 hours.  If they really wanted to get the time down, they should have put her bed on wheels, or at least on a freight pallet so a forklift could be used.  At this size, she's not a person, she's heavy cargo.  Load her on a flat bed truck and strap her down.	30
1	You're a dick, I'm an ass. I have found my home!	30
1	Usually its fat women projecting their insecurities on others that say that. The same way fat men will suggest that thin or fit men aren't as good as they are. But sometimes people will defend their inability to land an attractive partner with this fatlogic.	30
1	And the one next to it, and the one next that that one...	30
1	She can't even count! She only has 5 things listed in her 6 things you can't live without. So... lies about going to the gym, can't count to six, and fat. What a winner!	30
1	One on the right has some nice curve to her legs... Wonder what some silk stockings would do for her. YOWZA.  Anyway, hey Big Bird, move your fat ass!	30
1	The trash bag on the door handle, is that where it keeps it's gunetiks?	30
1	I've never seen someone so fat that even their foreheads were sagging.	30
1	She's actually standing up here. The chair is just a butt shelf.  That's the only way I can explain the chair not giving out.	30
1	We have a nice looking blonde with great legs staring down a whale. She's probably terrified for her life. It's like being dropped into the Rancor pit or running into a grizzly bear in the wild.   In that situation, you're supposed to make yourself as big and as loud a possible to scare the predator away. This poor girl is doomed, because there's nothing she can do to be louder or bigger than the whale.	30
1	&gt;That's a guy- look at the tits  This is a sentence that should never have to be uttered. (uddered?)  They just have to ruin everything.	30
1	"Insult me all you want" Challenge accepted!	30
1	Dude, covers cost money, money that could be better spent on McBeetus.	30
1	Same chick posted this same progress to r/xxfitness, got maybe 200 upvotes. Hours later a fatty fat fatass whines on and on about what "HAES means to her" and gets like 600 upvotes.  The fats have invaded and plagued fucking everywhere, even our fitness spaces.	30
1	She's fat in both pictures. And the comments seem to believe *less fat* her needed some *meat in her bones*.	30
1	lol she looks REALLY unhappy. And that makes me happy. :)	30
1	Wow he looks like much younger and much more attractive.	30
1	There's no such thing as "too busy". You either make time, or you make excuses.	30
1	Why the fuck do all the fatties make dresses that look like something an 8 year old would wear??? Seriously, I'm really asking here.  Is it because the fat in their brain is reducing their intelligence to that of a child??  Is it some deeply rooted psychological problem where they think they are children and never want to grow up?  Hence the lack of responsibility, throwing tantrums and expecting everyone to coddle them?	30
1	She has actually lost a bit of weight in that second pic.	30
1	Also, with all of that muscle mass, she can probably eat a bit more than pre six pack.  But it looks like anorexia to dr. Fat shit	30
1	Next stop: Skin cancer research lab!	30
1	Why do average frustrated chumps feel the need to insult or make fun of successful people in social media?  They only expose themselves to be painfully burned like the fatso in this post, [or like this one.](http://i.huffpost.com/gen/912939/original.jpg)	30
1	Is that what happens when you lose weight?  I thought your body had starvation mode?	30
1	It's very much impossible to shame a big dick.  A fatty on the other hand....	30
1	"She needs to eat! Someone give that girl a burger!"  Um, I thought they always say calories in/calories out don't affect your weight?	30
1	I guarantee if a bunch of fit women commented like that on an obese girl's photos with "girl needs to lose weight!" and "Stop feeding her!" there would be an uproar.	30
1	The only reason why she gets groped is because she is to big to walk around the bar with bumping into people. Honestly she's assaulting other people and doesn't have the self awareness to realize it.	30
1	When I was a kid, my neighbor threw out about 5 of those plastic lawn chairs. Me and my stupid friends took them and spent hours deliberately trying to break them.   Now, granted we were about 10 and none of us were obese, but we were totally incapable of damaging them. Those things are built to last.   It should be a serious wake up call to bust one of these things while using it as it was intended.	30
1	You know what, I'll just take these 7 in a row.  One for each day of the week.  I'm just waiting for Twat Munster to need a quadruple bypass and I'll come back for the Bugatti.	30
1	He either looks like that "gentle giant", goon football player type in high school, or like some young, up and coming CEO who has an oceanfront building in Miami. On an unrelated note, I still can't get over the fact that he grew up and taught in two towns that are not even 10 minutes from my house.	30
1	[Taylor swifts cameltoe](http://imgur.com/MyCoJSo)	30
1	I think FPH used her in their profile pic.	30
1	Much like how they say 'eff your beauty standards' and then proceed to wear a pound of makeup. I guess beauty standards only applies to fat.	30
1	Actually what happens is they use a heated cutting tool (like a hot knife) so that it "burns" through the skin. Trust me, obese people smell up the OR worse than anyone.	30
1	Those chairs can support a normal human even if one of the chair legs is missing   http://i.imgur.com/F9eaRvX.gif	30
1	For the sake of accuracy the man was 456lbs, he dropped 275lbs to a weight of 181 over the course of 382 days. Just another example reinforcing nutrition and why fat logic is just a bunch of excuses.   1lb of fat = 3500 stored calories 275x3500 = 962500 total calories burned 962500/382 = 2520 calories consumed from fat per day  Perfectly normal BMR. No bad guhnetics no starvation mode no bullshit. Fuckin landwhales.	30
1	Except if they knew anything about fitness they'd know that a fit girl (usually) eats a lot of food. But that food is lean proteins, veggies, etc. Abs are made in the kitchen.	30
1	Are those pants really high up, or are those some low hanging lady bits?	30
1	They were made really well and she was drinking. She was also a 2 pack a day smoker and that apparently kills your tastebuds and sense of smell.  She also apparently scarfed them down in a matter of minutes and probably wasn't so much concerned with the taste as she was with stuffing her fat face with as much food as possible. I've seen planets eat and they barely chew, I doubt they actually taste much of their food.	30
1	What kind of fat fuck thinks he can sit in a plastic chair and thinks it will hold his fat ass	30
1	&gt; Fuck em, girl is ripped and should gives no fucks on what sub human Hambeasts think.  Exactly. To be fair, she was much more "normal" in the first picture. She then obviously put in a ton of work and went well better than normal in the second picture. Not even close to anorexic...	30
1	I like how it **tried** to make a fitted corset like top, and absolutely failed, not just because she's a fat ass whale, but because he darts on her top and the angles are all wrong.  I just started sewing and my mock dress is better than this finished one.	30
1	Muscular butts are the best butts.  Round, bubbly, bouncy, appropriately firm when not flexed.	30
1	Sad how "American" this picture is.	30
1	Someone please contact her and tell her how amazingly fit she is, preferably by showing her this thread. It takes dedication, hard work and effort to achieve that.	30
1	&gt;getting excited hoping it dies   Jesus. I get they're fat and everything but wishing for them to die?	30
1	Jesus, that face actually made me wince.	30
1	As an American, I'm weeping on the inside.	30
1	there is a shitlord alternative at /r/holdmyfries	30
1	Husky, at least when I was growing up in the 70's and 80's was always clothing manufacturers code for "your kid is fat"	30
1	I walked into the local mcdees this nice afternoon and was met with appalling this  thing muttling on about how dumb the employees at the mcdonalds were. Apparently he wanted 2 large cups of soda to go along with his condishuns but was mistakenly given just one cup, simple error to be corrected. But he had to make a big show and scene of it. I was very glad the beetus had taken its legs away to beetusland.   If you notice,  his special wheel chair is like a double wide. Won't  be  long now for this one.	30
1	I figured it might have been on here before, but I searched and nothing came up.	30
1	A fat chick being proud of her fat tits is just like an unemployed man being proud of having the week off.	30
1	My BMI is right about 23 too. I also struggle with wanting to get it down, but people think it is crazy. Looking at me, 23 BMI still looks too chubby.	30
1	I'm not going to have any health insurance when I retire because fuckwads like this will drain Social Security dry with their 10,000 per month medical bills just to keep them fucking breathing on that scooter.	30
1	Girls that ripped are begging for me to gnaw and rub up on their abs because that shit is fucking sexy.	30
1	I was meaning now.  They have the Jabba :P	30
1	Because ~~losers~~ gainers hate winners.	30
1	Just another case of [sour grapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Grapes).  It helps with cognitive dissonance when you are fat and stupid (redundant, I know).	30
1	Wal Mart is where I go when I want to feel better about my life. Seriously, all you have to do is spend about 15 minutes walking around and you'll feel great.	30
1	They're not lying.  They *do* go to the gym.... [on pizza night. ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aYyfQnb)	30
1	Everything would translate as, "waaaaahh"	30
1	Pretty sure that's just a fold in her skirt, not actually lady bits. Otherwise she has a terrifyingly long torso.	30
1	She's been eating like this since she was a baby. Her mother fed her like this her entire childhood. Early childhood shapes a person more than anything. She is 19 now and has hit a wall of reality, what she does from now on is entirely on her and she must carry those decisions.	30
1	Haha, I'm an idiot!	30
1	Ton. They meant ton.	30
1	I disagree, I think Han Solo got exactly what he deserved. What did he expect running drugs for a slugs crime cartel to avoid Imperial tariffs?	30
1	Awh man. I thought it was ganna be a gif of that fat guy scarfing down a pizza while attempting to do a standing ab crunch workout.	30
1	FTFY  &gt;What , They  Fuck ?	30
1	Am I in the minority in thinking thin girls &gt; ripped girls?	30
1	[You mean,  like this?] ( http://i.imgur.com/zeJykAv)	30
1	My Subaru couldn't even handle all those curves.	30
1	Time to start working out then.  I was a total twig up until my early 20s and only dated girls who were in the 6/10 range, a little on the chubby side, etc. No "hot girl" had ever even given me the time of day.   So I started lifting and put on 25lbs, developed my own hobbies and interests and started putting effort into myself as a person, and coincidentally, I started getting not just a lot more attention from girls in general, but from girls who were completely out of my league before.	30
1	Ugh, flip flops. Half of the cows I work with are fat and wear flip flops TO WORK in an office environment where we're expected to dress decently. Swear I can smell their feet. Onions? Yeah. Onions and hint of cooking lard. Plus that sticking/squishing sound that the flip flops make as they're straining under the weight...ehhhhhgrossman.	30
1	OMG, if I ever go on Tinder, I'm totally using that! "I'm fit and have small boobs but a great squat booty, so it's an automatic swipe right."	30
1	People like this are the fucking worst. A few years ago I had three back surgeries in 11 months. I used these motorized carts at stores when I went shopping because walking was incredibly painful. More than a few times I had filthy, fat assholes yell at me for using them because I "clearly didn't need it." That experience completely changed my view on overweight individuals.	30
1	Here, my favorite [lady arms](http://www.yankeepotroast.org/images/vasquezaliens.jpg) to make you feel better.	30
1	No shoes. Real classy.	30
1	&gt; "Fat" tits, and your friend looks like overcooked bacon.   Why the hate on bacon? That shit is delicious!	30
1	Pretty sure they're shorts and probably are her lady bits. Tall people have to add height SOMEwhere, she added it to her torso AND legs. Seems fine by me.	30
1	Gilbert Grape and just let the house burn with her in it.	30
1	Probably more that it's really inaccurate because all the fatsos lie about their weight.	30
1	Honestly they don't spend that much time eating. Most of their junk foods are high in calories and require almost zero preparation. It's entirely plausible I spend more time cooking and cleaning up reap food than they do microwaving and eating pizza rolls. The real time sink for fat people is TV/computer/video games. They're fat too busy staring at that dimly lit screen to be healthy.	30
1	[You mean this one?] ( http://i.imgur.com/TUPDUkA.gif)	30
1	but you don't want to look like it.	30
1	You know what I fantasize about? Going to the streets late at night dressed as a robber and scare those fat piggies, make them scared shitless make them run for their life but I keep following until about 25 meters then they'll collapse because they can't run anymore.  Oohhh then I'll say "If you weren't such a fat fuck you could've done something in a situation like this! But I guess you don't give shit about your life since you've let it come this far." Goddamn I just wish I could see the look on those grease dripping faces.	30
1	Now that you mention it there is a striking resemblance between Krystal from the show and Tess....	30
1	I love how his first instinct is to make sure his fupa is covered up!	30
1	Well, once you get past like $50 million in personal wealth do you really need much more? I feel like that's a pretty generous limit. Hell, I'd be okay with $100 million. Allows people to reap the reward of success without resulting in a small percentage of "elites" obtaining a large portion of the available wealth out there. I'm not super liberal by any means but wealth distribution has become a serious problem affecting the middle class.	30
1	Ever notice how they all have the same types of lips? Inflated and pushed out by fat, and always slightly open.  It's really disturbing.	30
1	I mean, I personally find the before picture more attractive -- you can't get down on people for what they like.  But you'd be a fucking fool to claim that the after picture isn't a person who is stronger, more fit and leads a healthier lifestyle.  I guess the second picture reminds me of my sister who was a hardcore gymnast for 15 years.  The association turns me off.	30
1	Id assume its because its easier to carry weight when your hips take the strain, like when you lift someone up its easier to hug and lift with the hips and knees than cradle them using your back and arms. They're carrying another persons weight of mass around with them at all times so they're bound to adjust to it rather than trying to drop the mass.	30
1	I said it before and I'll say it again: The number one thing that helped with my depression was exercise. Anti-depressants did nothing for me. Exercise, planning out meals, reading about fitness...all of that did more for me than the anti-depressants.	30
1	Hell yeah she looks ill, that bodies sick!	30
1	Oh but they CAN be her. They willingly choose to remain ignorant about how to do so or they simply choose to eat and be lazy instead if they do know.	30
1	I want to be treated exactly the same as a skinny person. Except for the part where you weigh them at the start of every visit to check for sudden weight changes that could be indicative of serious health problems.	30
1	TIL TaySway probably has a sweet box.	30
1	I want to follow her around for a week and make her fat ass prove she eats nothing but vegetables once a week.	30
1	Taller within the limits your genetics allow, you're totally right, just thought I'd add that important disclaimer.	30
1	This one recently died a few months ago.	30
1	TIL having visible toned abs is anorexia. . . . . . .	30
1	[ME](http://i.imgur.com/auawggr.gifv)[ME](http://i.imgur.com/HcGVvMA.gifv)[ME](http://i.imgur.com/0iqFSqk.gifv)!	30
1	You posted almost exactly what I was going to say! I wasn't "born" lucky either. I work my ass off at it. I eat healthy meals. I lift 3x/week and run 3x/week. Minimum. (Helps that I love doing it, but still.)	30
1	This line is so great.  Needs to be delivered deadpan after reading card and then either 15 seconds of bertstare.jpg at patient or a big palms-up shrug.	30
1	Of course they're always open.	30
1	Big juicy bacon cheeseburgers taste best after crossing the finish line of a half marathon.	30
1	Fatlogic is truly astounding.	30
1	I though I'd heard that, but honestly didn't care enough to confirm.	30
1	It's for hooking up. Lots of girls say stuff like "not here to hookup!" which usually translates to "until I figure out if you're hot we're not gonna fuck".	30
1	I just started cooking for myself at home. I hate the pile of dishes in the sink afterward, but shit--I'm becoming a functioning adult and it's pretty fucking fulfilling.  I make a mean grilled chicken breast and asparagus stir fry btw.	30
1	Jesus shes my age! I look like a 12 year old compared to that XD	30
1	Honestly she looks more like 30 (compensating for Ham-status, actually looks 50) and is just lying about being 23	30
1	this is like the drunk driving commercials. i think this could actually work.*  *assuming a world of sane, rational people^teehee	30
1	As a very muscular and in shape fit person - I'm going to hand this to my doctor that is sorta' out of shape the next time I see him. Just for shitlording giggles.	30
1	Towie / the only way is Essex	30
1	.i like when fatty fupa and body shape and quirky clothing combine to make their body look like a puppet from hr puffinstuff.	30
1	I always take my 9 year old son.  He's so polite (exactly as I raised him), but he always gives me subtle glances to tell me he knows these people are degenerates.	30
1	That makes so much sense.	30
1	Same here. Depression becomes less and less each day in the iron temple.	30
1	What I'm more curious about is how in the hell she managed to waddle up all the way up there	30
1	I'M HEALTHY GODDAMNIT NOW FIX ALL MY HEALTH PROBLEMS.	30
1	I'll give her friend the benefit of the doubt until I see her in a pic with better light and more of her. But the fatty is automatically worthless.	30
1	Most girls that work out are slim with decent muscle tone as opposed to full on ripped.	30
1	People love to pretend its about meeting people and making friends but it's just for hooking up.	30
1	Jesus Christ I feel dumber just by reading its attempt at communicating through language.	30
1	Yep, it's definitely a balancing act, but if you prioritize it, you can fit it into basically any schedule. Social life is important, school is important, financial security is important, but if your life doesn't involve some amount of time devoted to taking care of your body so you can enjoy what the other parts afford you better and for longer, then you're doing it wrong.	30
1	I really wish that was a feature of Tinder.	30
1	That sounds like my dream man. Thank god I know what real curves are and am not an amorphous blob.	30
1	Yes! I wouldn't listen to this for the longest time. "How will going and getting sweaty make me not want to kill myself? That's bullshit, I'm just going to go cry in bed." Shit, I still haven't beaten it completely but now I know that when I get like that I should go outside for a walk or something at least.	30
1	HEY you guys were talking about ME right?	30
1	Especially considering that kind of definition would be impossible had she actually had anorexia.	30
1	Me!Me!Me!Me!Me!.  It's an anime short about people ditching the real world for their own fantasy getaway, be it anime, videogames, drugs, w/e.  Also happens to be porn.	30
1	Let me save you the read:  More Fat: 18 msgs, 74 likes, 81 visits.   Less Fat: 36 msgs, 211 likes, 210 visits.  The author concludes that 18 messages is more than zero. So this is somehow a success for the fatter her.	30
1	Shiiiet I'll take a flat stomach over big boobs on a woman any day..	30
1	woah... do we have to chop our own dicks off to enjoy this sub now?	30
1	You learned that today?	30
1	This isn't the sub to be posting pictures of the Grand Canyon.	30
1	Definitely not, but I think in her after picture if you saw her in more natural pose you would find that more attractive.	30
1	But aren't they always saying they NEED men with bigger equipment, smaller guys need not apply? What?	30
1	YES! This reminds me of an episode of CSI Vegas.   There's a BBW con going on, and a chubby chaser pics up an obeast whale. They drink and have sex and she passes out of top of him and kills him by suffocation. She tried to hide it but gets caught and she cries saying she was embarrass and that's why she hid it.  They had soft drama music trying to make you feel for the character but all I could do was laugh.	30
1	This happened to me too!  I didn't realize I'd been undereating for most of my life (&lt;= 1700 calories a day (5'11"/M/133lbs)).  Then the most recent BTFC came around and I thought I'd join.  I started eating ~2300 calories a day and exercising, and whaddaya know; I've gained some (lean) mass!  It's that simple.  It's hard work, but it's really that simple.	30
1	That pic is perfection.	30
1	24/2=12+24*=36 in ham years.	30
1	well to be fair, steven universe likes to pander to fat sjws anyway.	30
1	Whaaaat? Size ten is no way obese??	30
1	I'm seriously tired of this shit. I'm a proud American and I HATE how we're viewed by the rest of the world by the vocal minority.	30
1	Jesus is fake. Just like your gym membership.	30
1	I'm guessing made from titanium.	30
1	Seriously? This fat sack of shit is going to wear a shirt proclaiming her love of Christ and fail to follow even the basic tenets?   Gluttony? Check.  Sloth? Check.  Worshipping food (something that is not God)? Check.  According to the bible, the body is the temple of God. And she has desecrated it, let it fall into disrepair and probably fails at the most basic of hygiene practice.  **BONUS**: I'll go ahead and add envy on there as she probably wants the body of a shitlady.	30
1	"but...but FPH are the evil ones! they are always shaming us! thinprivl.... thinprivvigigae!!!11!!!"  this is why i read this sub. years and years of comments, none of which was any business of the fat fucks, always trying to bolster their egos. payback time!	30
1	I'd swipe right so fast.	30
1	That's because you need spiked bull bars on the front. They reduce the impact damage to the car whilst ensuring that the fatty doesn't get away.	30
1	Surely that has to physically hurt...	30
1	Well I assumed that it would be. But today just confirmed it.	30
1	It's because tumblrina HAES lardbuckets are way more vocal, and much easier to mock. Fat acceptance supporters tie it with feminism, for some stupid reason.	30
1	The fact that it had that kind of reaction clearly displays that this wasn't the first time.  Bonus: The glasses tried to run away.	30
1	Ha, well, enough about you, how about me.	30
1	I thought anorexia is a eating disorder that makes a person eat less, leading to malnurishment. Anorexia doesn't necessarily mean a person is super skinny. They could be normal weight and then become anorexic, leading to eventual loss of muscle mass, development of heart conditions, etc.  Those comments from the post also seem to misunderstand what anorexia is too...	30
1	She acts like her fluctuating weight is some grandiose endeavor that she struggles with constantly. It doesn't have to be a struggle if you have the slightest iota of discipline and self control. She can afford personal trainers and chefs even that could supply her with nothing but a healthy lifestyle. Lazy, worthless piece of shit. I hope she dies soon.	30
1	The only 'whacking' I'd do would be my face against a concrete wall at the thought of having sex with a ham.	30
1	It shouldn't have let itself become such a fat fuck in the first place. Any progress that you think you see is due solely to gravitational lensing.	30
1	I wish this thread was talking about ME. I love Mass Effect!	30
1	"health at every size" is even more infuriating.	30
1	He has a bigger belly than a pregnant woman about to go into labor.	30
1	See, this is an amazing insight actually into why nice guy neckhams stay fat, because they put no effort into themselves but expect people to fall all over them regardless. And when they don't, well that's their fault.	30
1	Can I bite you instead?	30
1	Jesus why???	30
1	Hot damn those are the cankliest cankles I've seen in a while	30
1	I spent a few minutes looking at that one and it just boggles my mind, it even looks like all that fat is blocking most of the blood from entering her hands(?).	30
1	I'm suffering from some cystic acne at the moment and I know that even though my skin looks absolutely awful I'm still 110% better looking than these hambeasts 'cause i'm not fat :) It's a good feeling.	30
1	Is that what giving up looks like?	30
1	If I'm not mistaken, to be officially diagnosed according to the DSM V, the person must be under bmi of 18.	30
1	That's what being ripped is, ding dong. If she were to decrease water intake for a couple days, sit in a dry sauna(whatever they're called), sure she'd be more magazine "shredded" but c'mon now, for a girl to get abs like that is crazy.	30
1	Because they are also stupid and can't spell shit	30
1	What did you expect? Fats are entitled assholes, and it's well known they're unable to congratulate anyone on anything because they're unhappy and insecure piles of shit	30
1	As a black guy I can sadly confirm this. The men of my race have 0 standards as long as they can get arse. I'm so proud my woman still keeps her abs.	30
1	This is the most efficient, dirtiest of bulks.	30
1	I'd love to see an instance on a tv show where someone like Dr.Cox from Scrubs or Dr.House received one of these. Pretty sure they'd tear them apart and stuff it down their fat holes.	30
1	Mobile cranes like the one used will have different load limits at varying levels of extension of their booms.    Chances are the first crane had the ability to lift what they guessed the weight was.  But once they extended the boom all the way out to the exit from the lair, it was over limit.  That... or fatty lied about their weight and they didn't find out until the first crane started tipping over.	30
1	All fatness aside, that misalignment of the stripes really bothers me. I cant tell if its just cheap design or the fat is causing the lines to distort	30
1	I'll take 2, 80 oz of chocolate genehtiks please.	30
1	America has so much potential. We completely squander it by allowing people to exist in this state of being. So sad.	30
1	Is it just me or does preworkout make anyone else angry? Angry to where I kill it in the gym, but if I guy checks me out and I don't find him attractive I'm automatically like "CAN I HELP YOU WHAT IN THE FUCK ARE YOU LOOKING AT GET AWAY FROM ME HAJDKSJSMEHKABSK"	30
1	It amazes me how a ''cardigan'' for them is a couch cover for me.	30
1	Also anorexia isn't the result of hard work, it's a mental illness.	30
1	Do you want to know why we hate fat people?  This is the reason, plain and simple.	30
1	And I use methamphetamine to study..	30
1	I'd say both of them honestly. Natural, proportionate humans.	30
1	It's holding on to dear life!	30
1	They mentioned it because it fits the stereotype? The American south is the historical home of the "American Royalty," who kept control of their plantations by marrying within the family. It's a real thing. It just got blown out of proportion by simplistic media portrayals. Don't jump on a guy just because of a little self-deprecating humor.	30
1	Exactly.  She has the wealth to easily have excellent-tasting and healthy food brought to her at the ideal schedule--multiple times per day in small portions rather than "meals."  She can have an assistant answer e-mails or take dictation while she works out on the finest machinery with the best personal trainers.  And yet chooses not to.	30
1	I didn't get abs until I started eating more, not less. You need calories to gain muscle mass. It's infuriating when people can't wrap their head around that. The shit I get for counting calories and being lean.	30
1	That should be a support message to people trying to lose/gain weight. Remind them that people hate those who succeed at their own failures. Remember, the straight and narrow is always easy to fall off.	30
1	Thin privilege is not needing a second, more powerful crane.	30
1	she didn't. usually in a ball park that's the hallway. and there were either escalators or a parking lot level with this... she's In more of a handicapped area where they don't have to walk down stairs to get to their seats... there's no way she COULD walk those stairs like that anyway. I'm surprised there's no scooter.  Source: Been going to baseball games at different stadiums for 22 years	30
1	Holy shit, she's 19???	30
1	YOU GUYS, CAN WE PLEASE GO? I can't think of anything better than shitlording during the day, gambling at night, and strip clubs 24/7.  Can we? Can we? Please please please please PLEEEEEEASE!!!!!	30
1	Is that the chick from my 600 lb life? Zsalynn I think her name was?	30
1	It's going to be interesting to see what marries them	30
1	being sub 10% does definitely not make a woman "anorexic" or "unattractive" though.  is it normal for women?  no.  but that is because "normal" is a bmi of 30+.  should it be normal?  fuck no.	30
1	You're not going to like this then because next to his medical costs... That wheelchair is expensive as fk and will probably have to be replaced within 2 years with someone like this. That lifting mat he's sitting on means that there either is a system connected to the ceiling to move him from one place to another or a moveable lift, neither is cheap and more expensive with his weight. Considering that, he isn't moving his own ass so there's probably someone who gets paid to get his fat ass out of bed....	30
1	Watch the majestic lard perch in its nest gobbling up sugar to then feed to its most likely equal sized children. Amazing, absolutely amazing...ly disgusting!	30
1	There's more!  "True to its name, heavy cream is very heavy. I’ve eaten/drunk way more before, but nothing has ever had that weighty feeling in my stomach before. Oh, and I’ve added eight inches to my waist since I’ve started gaining. Enjoy."	30
1	This "person"  * is unattractive and will likely remain unattractive * is displaying childish behaviour at what is supposed to be a mature age("look im so quirky and cute lol") * will contribute little to nothing to society * will likely actually be a drain on society(collecting disabled aid because "muh kundishuns") * will die an early, preventable death * will not get to experience all things physical(strength, fitness, (good) sex, etc...) * will have a lesser quality of life * will have lower intelligence due to obesity   Why do people do this with their lives?	30
1	"True beauty comes from the inside"  That's just something ugly people say...	30
1	I worked with a butter freebaser who told HR she had to wear them because it's impossible to find shoes that fit the circumference of her feet but aren't super-long.  I'd never considered foot fat to be yet one more challenge these morons inflict on themselves.  Since she claimed it as a condishun HR had to make her managers give her an exception to normal office policy (and societal politeness).  Of course they were from the 99 cent store, so the plastic itself smelled terrible.  Then add in ranch-sweat...ugh....	30
1	You can't choose your genetics!	30
1	We hobbits are not fat! Gtfo Golem!	30
1	oh my God, the username....  what did she think was going to happen in here?	30
1	This place gets real weird sometimes.	30
1	easy there.  we have no beef with retarded folks.  as long as they aren't fat.	30
1	No one gives a fuck if it's losing weight. It's a fat disgusting hippo and we detest it's existence.	30
1	My ex did crossfit (we got along cause I lift I think). Her ass was by far the best thing in my hands ever. My current girlfriend is far less active, and enjoys the occasional run. I enjoy her ass, don't get me wrong, but I enjoyed my exes far more.   I pray she doesn't ever find my reddit account info. I'm fucked if she does.	30
1	Fuck what other people think.	30
1	This is r/fatpeoplehate, not r/fatpeopledisdain.	30
1	&gt;whacking it until I'm too sore to get it up again  I've been on some pretty crazy mixes of different substance and I still don't think I've ever done this to myself.  I don't think she really understands male sexuality...which makes sense.	30
1	A calorie is a calorie, it does not matter where it comes from. All foods are not equal in terms of nutritional value though. You aren't going to be very healthy if you eat 1500 calories of greasy mcdonalds on a daily basis compared to 1500 calories of a well balanced, non-processed diet. You might not be fat since you're only consuming 1500 a day but there's no way you're healthy.	30
1	Disgusting. Absolutely repulsive.  Why would anyone DO this.	30
1	WTF the gov't spends more in 8 hour's than I'll make in 3 years of work on a worthless blob that ADDS NOTHING BACK INTO THE ECONOMY OR IS OF ANY USE TO SOCIETY.  Can we have a eugenics for obesity please?	30
1	I remember seeing her covers on youtube a while back. Looked her up just now, apparently she died of kidney failure and skin infections at 37. Shocking.	30
1	Plot twist: In addition to imprisonment for criminals, heads are transplanted on to fatshit bodies and forced to do physical labor to get skinny again.	30
1	Wtf is up with her skin texture?	30
1	Idk dude, I've seen plenty of thin runners get some really hot girls, biggest muscle being their calves.   Yeah, a lot of girls want that swole look, but plenty of good looking girls like a runner's body, if I'm saying that right. I said it already in this thread I prefer cardio fit vs lifter fit.   You said twig though, so maybe you were out of the ordinary small.	30
1	I bet her eyes are brown lol.  Also: `Sex`: **F**ucking never.	30
1	lol? this is around 15-18 procent fat.... if youre sub 10 as a woman youre probably dead	30
1	That's very generous of you.	30
1	Only 3 Me!'s :\^)	30
1	It's probably the design, but let's just blame the fatty, it's funnier that way.	30
1	I'm pretty sure this is Kim Dotcom.	30
1	Yes that was the joke.	30
1	Covers up her weight but not her drivers license number. Genius.	30
1	Leave Cinderella alone, you fat ugly sister fuck.	30
1	Haha yep.  She decided to indulge herself...	30
1	That was such a brave joke. Hat's off to you.	30
1	Lol I actually never thought about this shit like that.  So people can gain weight by eating more but can't lose weight because it is genetically predetermined?   That might be among the biggest fatlogic fallacies ever.	30
1	I SNORT HYDROXYCUT TO LOSE WEIGHT	30
1	fat is not a protected class	30
1	In this photo: Waste receptacle  Also, there is a portable toilet.	30
1	Oompa Loompa doopity date.  We are the lords of fat people hate.  We are here to point the blame, so sit your fatasses in your shame.  What do you get when you guzzle down sweets?  Eating as much as an elephant eats?  What are you at, getting terribly fat?  What do you think will come of that?  I don't like the look of it.	30
1	Yup.  Right up there with the whole "If I'm too big for you, you don't have the equipment to handle me" thing.  Though I think that got jettisoned after people started replying with "Yeah, forklifts are a bitch to get certified for."	30
1	She does a study to find out who men are more attracted to.. She doesn't get what she wanted, but what she expected.. Therefore she is even happier to be fat..	30
1	I think the point was that she has no excuse.  One could argue that the average person has a number of obstacles to overcome to make those important healthy lifestyles changes, but Oprah has no excuse.  She has, like, negative excuses for being fat.  Ugh.  If I had her resources I would be like the queen of shitladies.  Fuck her.	30
1	&gt; YOU CAN BE FAT AND BE ANOREXIC  No, you can't. If you have disordered eating habits while not underweight then you'd be diagnosed with EDNOS. One of the criteria for anorexia nervosa is maintaining a body weight below 85% of that expected. [Here's] (http://casat.unr.edu/docs/eatingdisorders_criteria.pdf) a good source on the matter.	30
1	I think that ideal female body of yours is almost every guys, holy hell	30
1	I know it's a dick move to hope for anyone's death, but if this kind of thing keeps happening it's going to put a serious dent in the HAES movement...so, fingers crossed. (Looking at you, T-Monster)	30
1	Junior plenty?  JUNIOR PLENTY? WTF?  I'm done for today guys, my brain is melting.	30
1	Spending on a non-contributing person isn't necessarily bad, for example palliative care for child leukemia.  It's when the person willfully does not contribute and in fact purposely consumes many resources as possible that we're outraged.	30
1	He is probably trying his best to distance himself from type casting. As much as I love the Ron Swanson thing at some point it's going to get old as fuck for him.	30
1	I knew this was a cult!	30
1	This was in response to a facebook ad for Kate Hudson's Fabletics Active wear... sigh	30
1	As a crane operator I just want to take a moment to compliment how accurate the drawing of the crane is.	30
1	[Welcome to Gonewild](http://i.imgur.com/JjJV50Y.png).	30
1	Should probably tag that as NSFW bud.	30
1	It seriously looks like her arms are diseased and need to be amputated.	30
1	Seriously? This isn't a progress pic menu.  Maybe they're just used to the Menu format.	30
1	I still have no idea how girl sizes work or what has changed, but wasn't size 8 the cliche cut off for huge?	30
1	I'm in the same boat. My fiancee does mostly cardio and treats it like a chore/punishment, and she turns it into a back alley brawl if I ever suggest she maybe just once try doing a barbell squat, because that means I want her to look like a man. I love her to death, and she's still very attractive, but I do miss dating that hardbody kind of girl.  She's starting to ask me 'what that Reddit site is that I'm always on' though. So every few months I just go through my account and delete my entire post history haha.	30
1	Personally,  I think she looks more like the [Dirty Bubble. ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sxh4NzC)	30
1	It's was bad enough thinking that they were bitching over normal clothes but bitching over active wear not being big enough? Are you kidding me? As if they're gonna use it for working out anyways	30
1	&gt;Second, more powerful crane arrives  L M A O  M  A  O	30
1	Time to get verified.	30
1	This applies to literally any size comparison. If you have a gut, your arms/legs/tits/ass isn't "big", it's "fat".  That's how this shit works.	30
1	I feel like such a horrible person for agreeing with you.  Thank FSM it's the internet.	30
1	This isn't normal plus size. This is ADVANCED PLUS SIZE.	30
1	Really they're just children.  I'm very convinced that fat people simple never grew up.  They think and act like children.  Huge, disgusting, overgrown children.  Most children can't really empathize while they're young.  They are very focused on the self and can only view things from their own perspective.  Fats never mature beyond this point.	30
1	How does that much ugly even exist?!	30
1	Thank you, come again.	30
1	Even then one would expect the butt shelf to collapse	30
1	Ewww.... why would you want that job?	30
1	fat people always taking the easy route to burn calories smfh	30
1	that's fat. Fat isn't only spread unevenly under the skin it actualy tries to seep out.	30
1	Yesterday, this girl was salty because some fitness channel said it's bad even to be a few pounds overweight, and she was like "there's nothing wrong with just a few pounds, that's perfectly healthy" No it's not. That why it's called "overweight"	30
1	I dated a water aerobics instrutor for a couple of years.  Beyond how awesome she looked and how great her body felt, she was so athletic our sex was borderline violent--in the best way possible.  The tender moments were great, too, but the times when she'd be so horny she would attack me are what I remember most fondly.	30
1	The fatties get out in full force about that. If you can't fit into the XXL, seriously you have BIGGER problems. And no one wants to see your fat ass squeezing into those tights anyway.	30
1	I'm 32 and she looks 10 years older than me. Also, the shitty blush placement isn't really helping her case.	30
1	Or maybe acre? Square mile?	30
1	Of course she's narcissistic, she puts her ugly mug and fat body on the front cover of every issue of her shitty magazine, in expensive dresses, heavy make up, and then has someone photo shop the shit out of her fat body because she knows it's gross.	30
1	Another reason I love it here so much.  No matter how terrible the thought, you know someone is thinking the same thing.	30
1	We write posts about them dying all the time. Fuck people are getting soft.	30
1	Well, it's got a pretty large canvas to work on.	30
1	Doctors can fire their patients IIRC.	30
1	Had to he a troll account. Nobody is THAT stup..., oh, wait, nevermind.	30
1	On top of that susceptible to lots of change over a short time.	30
1	He's into bodybuilding. Building a dad body, one pint of heavy cream at a time. That gut is so repulsive! That was more effective than a bucket of ice-cold water directly on my ladyparts.	30
1	Dude, this is what I try to tell my guy friends, my girlbros, and even some people in my family. You aren't going to get out what you don't put in. I swear some people have no self awareness. If you are lazy, fat, unmotivated, the people you want are not only never going to meet  you (because your fatass stays inside all the time) but they aren't going to want you either.	30
1	She used to be thin.  I remember her talk show when she was slim and in shape.  She complained that it was miserable keeping up that life style and she just quit.  Hence her plumpy-ass self we see today.	30
1	I would say that in her case genetics is what's responsible for her hip to waist ratio, as plenty of fit women are less extremely hour glass shape. But that'd be about it.	30
1	They're magically disgusting.	30
1	Alternative birth control....is that a caption to the image or an ad?	30
1	Yes they can, and that's the exact terminology used for it.	30
1	No fatties allowed? Too bad that isn't a requirement for ALL jobs. You're lucky!	30
1	I'll bet you a bottle of ranch her gut sticks out past her "tits".	30
1	Abs are made in the gym. They are revealed in the kitchen.	30
1	And, of course, the obligatory fucked up hair to go with the nasty ass fat fucking body.	30
1	My friend is a size 20, I'm a size 0/2, and I literally fit fully into one of her pant legs.  (Yes, I'm friends with a fatty. We've been friends since before she was fat. I subtly shitlady her all the time, and it's kicking in.)	30
1	It's not like they're going to listen to what the doctor has to say ANYWAY	30
1	I'm glad there are other professions where weight in a major concern!  I work in masonry and most of the work we do is high on a scaffold on the exterior of a building.  When we work on high-scaffold or high-lift buildings, we very intentionally do not put fatties on those jobs.  They are a danger to themselves and to others.	30
1	it has to be. it must be. i want it to be bc i don't want to think something so vile is in existence within my reality	30
1	It is a mixture of things.  Poor diet / lifestyle that leads to obesity also makes you look older. Bad skin makes you look older. The extra weight makes you feel and look older due to the stress and exhaustion of carrying it around with you. Fat can actually distort the face to make you look older. Laziness when it comes to caring for yourself (Clothes, hair, makeup, etc.) can make you look older.	30
1	anything to avoid doing real exercise.	30
1	she's 22. She's pretty much the same age as me and over 6 times my weight. I'm astounded.	30
1	Yeah.... Joke.....	30
1	Glad you included a human for scale.	30
1	Fuck you for making me visualize that, and hear it.	30
1	&gt; I literally fit fully into one of her pant legs  Oh. My. God. I think I need to hear how fat people are based on their clothing sizes and how many times a healthy person can fit into them from now on.	30
1	Shoulda kicked both legs dumbass! Haha and he fell too.	30
1	"Thin or fit petite girls only, I'm just not into big ladies!"	30
1	No, he didn't. I think it was perfect.	30
1	.....Or as the rest of the human world call them...bedsheets.	30
1	It's the unexplainable pride of where you were born.   I wasn't aware being involved in the country's formation was a requirement for patriotism.	30
1	I know we've called a lot of people Dickbutt recently, but this is it. This is the one.	30
1	turn the caps lock of you stupid fucking ham	30
1	They probably also way like children but with adult sized portions: chicken nuggets, fries, pizza, candy and soda are a child's dream diet.	30
1	I'm thinking she isn't going to have those hands much longer.	30
1	They aren't hatin on you for being bi, this sub is actually pretty against homophobia. It's just the way you said it, like she's gross for having abs. She wasn't fat before, but she looks great with muscle.	30
1	It must have been torturous for the guy in that advert to have those sausages around his neck while they took the photo.  "Are we finished yet? Can I eat them now?"  "No."  "Whoops, too late."  "Dammit tubby, that's the fourth lot of sausages you've scoffed"	30
1	Looks like it could be a character out of Kick-Ass.  Fat-Ass, probably.	30
1	&gt;i dont understand	30
1	Flat stomach is way hotter than boobs anyway. I'd much rather be with a girl with no boobs, even a double mastectomy with huge scars than one with a belly.	30
1	&gt; Is it some deeply rooted psychological problem  I'd love to see if there's some kind of disorder that [BED](http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/eating-disorders/binge-eating-disorder/binge-eating-disorder-symptoms) piggybacks on given the lying, shame, disgust, and, above all, inhuman portions at meals. There's no way that BED is a standalone disorder. There must be some kind of disorder it piggybacks on to turn adults into over-inflated manchildren.	30
1	If the question was "what is the best type of belly to use as a space hopper?", then I guess it is perfect.	30
1	HA! I'm glad someone else had the same thought.  That said, how long until tumblrinas start bitching about this?	30
1	Idk, I wouldn't mind slashing that trailer off with a sword. It'd be fun	30
1	Well, she didn't woosh, she understood the joke.  Edit: Gender	30
1	as a sausage-kin I find this offensive, my people would never hurt you we just want to shovel ourselves in your mouth	30
1	She's notorious for yo-yoing. I just really meant that her face is busted.	30
1	The one on the right... are those... orange and green condoms...?  I mean, I guess she's got to find something to do with them now that it has occurred to her that they will never be put to their intended use.  Apparently lashing out on twitter and berating people into accepting her 'beauty' didn't bring in the haul of dicks she was expecting.  Edit:  Heh, figurative dicks instead of literal ones.	30
1	My Anaconda don't want none cause you got con-dish-uns!	30
1	Pilot here. I love those weight limit requirements. Somebody's fat could literally kill everyone.	30
1	I don't think Stranger 2 was too hard on the fatty.	30
1	Maybe you are just surrounded by too many shitty people brobeans, I love my friends, my community, and my country. oh and my right to hate the fatties	30
1	But she "feels" better with being fat vs than being skinny version of her youth...	30
1	I bet that's not how /u/BoneyJabronie spins it when talking about it later though.	30
1	Is this a facial analysis tool? Link please? I wanna play with it  EDIT: Nvm. Found it. How-old.net for those interested	30
1	**UGH** I just had a worse thought  this is probably someones horrifying feeder auto erotic asphyxiation fat neck fold fetish-conglomerate of disgusting proportions	30
1	There was one episode of House where there was a fat guy who insisted that his fat wasn't the cause of his illness. It turned out that he was right.  \&gt;mfw  There was one instance when he passed out and caused some major property damage when he fell. That was funny.	30
1	I never said they snuck on scene. Can't speak for police but as an EMT, if I come across a holy-fucking-shit-you-gotta-see-this situation I just call dispatch and request additional personnel. Obviously they can't send everyone but at least a few of my buddies will get to see the show.	30
1	Are there anymore of these adverts? I'd like to see a prescription bottle of candy or chips, and someone ''cutting'' wrists with a french fry and ketchup.	30
1	That's.... why :(	30
1	Can confirm: got fired by doctor related to amphetamine addiction.  By the way /u/DoctorShitlady, can I get a prescription for Adderall?	30
1	It's probably a cheap garment made in China by a 18 yr old girl who wonders "what type of blimp is this for?" while trying to finish up fast so her boss doesn't dock her pay.   The pattern misalignment would not be as visible if this was on a person the garment was fit for.	30
1	"Body shaming is wrong!!1!"  Proceeds to body shame.  Ham logic at its finest.	30
1	"Girls that ripped aren't attractive"  Makes me want to say: "Maybe she isn't trying to attract YOU. Maybe she wants to look attractive to herself!"	30
1	I hope this doesn't count as sympathy.  I hated being fat.  I was once 100 lb overweight, I didn't lose half of my dick.  I lost 1/8th of my dick.  I went from above average dick size to.. above average dick size.  Facts &gt; jokes or fee fees.  Big dicks aren't going to magically shrink.  Either the dick wasn't big or they are bigger than Tess Munster which imo is not exactly normal in young people at least in my life.  23 bmi but it's a throwaway either way since I don't like talking about my dick in public on a normal account.	30
1	Those actually aren't bad ideas haha.  We should commission someone to bring those to life	30
1	Benned for fat sympathy.	30
1	[If only](http://cdn.iwastesomuchtime.com/1252015180219forgetsheisntontheinternetfunnycomic.jpg)	30

1	How can someone be proud of this?	30
1	Great work on titles in this sub today	30

1	Fat bitches have no idea how make up works and always end up with two different skin tones.	30
1	Nothing hot about fats or incest.  Benned.	30
1	I love learning where phrases come from! Thanks for the surprise etymology lesson!	30
1	So it's about real life?   I'm being serious, not trying to be an asshole. Is the fantasy getaway like a giant computer simulation to give you what you truly desire, or is it just people playing video games and doing drugs to escape their problems?	30
1	I'm sure she'll stop working out now she knows you don't approve.	30
1	I appreciate your forthrightness, but feel I must counter your anecdote with [this fellow](http://www.gaysubmit.com/data/images/2011/12/bricksshit.jpg), whose monster cock made a full retreat as soon as his body crossed the BMI-25 line.	30
1	can you lower your voice please	30
1	Drowning in poon maybe.	30
1	For women it is, and yes I do	30

1	Each to their own but a six pack is better than a body that resembles a sack of cottage cheese. Normal or in shape is ALWAYS better than fat.	30
1	My anaconda definitely doesn't	30
1	Any double digit dress size is a plus size in my opinion. 10 and up? You're plus sized.	30
1	No matter person or whale, rape is rape. It is not funny and is not ever "deserved".	30
1	I see 4 lbs of make up. Fighting them beauty standards right there.	30
1	I mean, no shit trans-people who pass or are androgynous are treated better. It's not right, but it's understandable that the if someone sees an obvious dude wearing women's clothing, especially one who's morbidly obese, they're going to think "this person clearly has a severe mental disorder, and I want to avoid them." Especially if they have their tumblrina game on in real-life.	30
1	Black guy as well. Can confirm. Whales hit on me way too often. I have had the opportunity to explain why I can't be with a whale. My lifestyle does t allow it. I like to run, play sports, lift and explore the world, not be caught in a gravitational pull by a hamplanet. Some understand. Some get very angry. I laugh either way.	30
1	That pig is way leaner than the ham east pictured above.	30
1	Nah. Giving up implies there was trying at some point and I don't believe that to be the case here.	30
1	&gt; 18  Sure	30
1	There's a fair amount of debate about what the story behind it really is. It's only a few minutes long though and if you like anime you'll probably dig it. http://animatorexpo.com/mememe/ It's not porn btw there's just some nudity so NSFW.	30
1	HATE US CAUSE THE AIN'T US	30
1	I love talking about my dick in public and on this, my main account.  I could go on all day about my dick.  My dick is massive, once I turned left too fast and NASA had to re-calibrate the Hubble Space Telescope.	30
1	No one on this sub will ever hate on you for being bisexual. We really don't care about sexual identity or gender identity on this sub. It literally is if centred around fat. I don't know why people downvoted you. But it won't be because you're bi.	30
1	I simply cannot fathom how this is possible	30
1	&gt;"until I figure out if you're hot we're not gonna fuck".  Um, that's how it works, bud.	30
1	I.....I kinda want to see a picture, even against my better judgement.	30
1	There have been studies linking obesity and mental health issues. Excess fat accumulation has been shown to decrease mental capacity, as well, hindering their ability to learn and remember things.  So, yes. They are *giant* children. Thought that may be an insult to children....	30
1	'Don't worry, it's for a friend' doesn't really work here.	30
1	i see loose way way too much. i dont understand how so many people can not know how to spell the word lose	30
1	I know that sausages are pretty much the only food that can be used to hang someone, but nutritionally I'm pretty sure that's not what made them into hamplanets.   200g of some decent sausage + 150g of kidney beans + some veggie mix will get under 800kcal, and will fill me up for half a day, which includes gym or cardio. Eating above my TDEE (~2800kcal) would be damn hard in this way.  Heck, [even ungodly amounts like 1.5kg of sausage](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.5kg+of+sausage) wouldn't do it (while giving nice 200g of protein).	30
1	Calories don't exist?! *CALORIES DON'T EXIST?!*  Fuck sakes, you know what really doesn't exist? This ham's self decency and self-control. Lord help you? God isn't going to help you wipe your own ass.	30
1	You can dismiss a patient from a practice but it's a pain in the ass, you have to give them written notice and sufficient warning.	30
1	100 grand to complete this "rescue". I reckon a good portion of the public would be happy to toss her back in the sea rather than spend another 100k to move her again.	30
1	I finally got a "hell yeah" from someone when I told them I've lost about 5 pounds. I can't mention weight to *anyone* because I'm thin and the fact that I want to drop a few makes them uncomfortable. Well, maybe if you got your asses off the couch and put down the fork, you might drop a few, yourself.	30
1	My stomach pretty much revolted in protest looking at that 'bounty' of fried garbage.  I think I'll skip lunch now.	30
1	seriously, lots of clever people showing up here I love it	30
1	How... much.... can.... those.... eat? I'm honestly still quite new here but... how? I swear I couldn't even eat a fifth of that!	30
1	*eat whatever you want while you're young, so you never have to get old!*	30
1	That's because no matter what they claim, deep down they're fucking ashamed of their weight.	30
1	How do people miss the "hitler" flair.	30
1	Lol someone came through here and downvoted everyone's comment and this post.  *okay*	30
1	They are rating the bacon friend	30

1	doesn't bbw mean big bodied women. Also who supersizes a happy meal	30
1	But but I'm such a NICE guy! Why won't you have sex with me instead of that dudebro boyfriend who has a good job and beefy shoulders?? Huh you swine bitch? I'm NICE! 😭🍨😭🍕	30
1	Banned for being a pig fucker.	30
1	I generally (as an American) thought this as well.	30
1	&gt; \#caloriesdontexist  Hams are achieving new levels of logic rejection	30
1	Probably the fatties that lurk in the shadows of this subreddit.	30
1	I said this in another comment; whether you have fat is up to you, but how that fat is distributed is up to genetics.  I don't think thigh gap is something worth focusing on, honestly. Certainly not worth being underweight for, as that comes with a host of other health problems.	30
1	Eating way more than 10000 calories a day for a very long period of time	30
1	*Real* women wear sizes larger than 20. Anything smaller is unhealthy and unrealistic	30
1	Thin privilege is being able to live past 40 apparently.  Seriously though, in 50 years when I'm in my early 70s I doubt any of these landwhales from my generation will still be around. Going to be interesting.	30
1	I'm aware, mate. But they preface in their description as "not looking for a hookup" when in reality they totally are but just don't want to come across as a hoe or something.	30
1	Well then, I guess it's my job to upvote everyone.   I DARE YOU TO TAKE MY UPVOTES, FATTIES!	30
1	Ok now lower the gun towards your temple, now pull the trigger.	30
1	You can't make this shit up.	30
1	I think they're talking about the bacon friend.	30
1	Maybe. If they can confirm that I would gladly unban.	30
1	Can you just laugh when they hand you one of these cards?  Scrubs or House come to mind.	30
1	Funny, I wasn't born fat, I got fat.   And funny, I lose the fat after being in control of my own food and I've kept it off for 4 years. http://i.imgur.com/G8aIDj8.png Funny, even since then I've changed my "born with it body" to be even more muscular and fit every year  http://i.imgur.com/fCidz50.jpg  Funny how four hours a week of lifting and one of hiit can change your "lucky born with body"	30
1	Yep, big fan of horse racing when I lived in Ireland. Didn't gamble, just loved to watch it on T.V.  I remember seeing a calender, or something in the newspaper where it had a bunch of different athletes topless. Jockeys surprised the hell out of me. All looked like rock-climbers, or horse-riding versions of Bruce Lee.	30
1	Dear goodness man, give a warning would ya? NSFW/NSFL or something.  So anyways, who is that? How do we know he is hiding a baby arm under his fupa?	30
1	Reality TV/ Daily Mail famous. So no not really.	30
1	NSFL? Yikes!   [Eye bleach!](http://i.imgur.com/zTleoST.jpg)     I am a robit.	30
1	What about "Don't worry, it's for an Internet stranger"?	30
1	You are a generous God.	30
1	Fat titties are a myth, its just blobs of amorphous trash  Get the fuck out you zoophile, you're giving us a rash  With views disgusting and a desire to boink a pig  On the ride of life she doesn't qualify, shes far too big  Banned for wanting to lay with a beast of butter, its really sick  Watch out you don't use mustard, or a hotdog she'll thnk your dick  Om nom nom she will snap it off like a bear, her feefees you coddle  As the nasty bear bitch moves forth, her fat jiggling every waddle	30
1	There is a stickied post about fat sympathy right now that you should go read. It's not allowed. The mods will ban you. The sub isn't called /r/weusuallydontlikefatpeople.	30
1	i seriously came here to say this.. like wtf how can someone be shaped like that... is her back broken or something? good lord seriously i dont know what to think anymore fat people are breaking boundaries i never thought could be crossed without certain immediate death	30
1	Another one of those people that things changing terminology changes the condition.  Hence: fluffy, big-boned, husky, plus sized.  The correct terminology in all of those cases is fat, fat, fat fatty fat fat.	30
1	It's a troll account. This is the internet.	30
1	I was once called anorexic while I was eating food from fucking Rally's. And it was because I only ordered a small fries and a small soda. Seriously, they're the most delusional creatures.	30
1	She only had ONE FUCKING LEG because they had to amputate the other because of type 2 beetus.	30
1	Calm down man. I heard she goes to church like once every month or two, so 'sall good.	30
1	I see poorly applied makeup that seems to have all been rubbed off around the mouth area on the 5 Big Macs she just shoved in her mouth.	30
1	"Junior Plenty" lol give me a minute to pick myself up off the floor.	30
1	She has THREE. KIDS. h..how,...	30
1	You know he's still going to eat that pizza.	30
1	Upvoting everyone to combat the downvote fatties.  Also, that shitlord comment at the bottom "when do calories ever count for you lol" is sadly as harsh as they come on most facebook posts these days	30
1	No photoshop, but plastered in makeup.	30
1	Stick it to them!	30
1	Still the ugliest thing I've seen today.	30
1	Damn, quality troll though.	30
1	Fatties will get this banned for not providing the sausages to eat.	30
1	Yeah, sadly when you non-anonymously call fatties out you're relentlessly called a bully.	30
1	I hope something mauls her dead one day, stupid fat cunt.	30
1	Beasts like that have no place in modern society and should be put down for the safety of others. I would never dream of letting my kids near something so dangerous and awful.  The pitbull, on the other hand, I feel very sorry for.	30
1	How long is your personality?	30
1	Exactly, because even poking these fatties doughy feelings with a feather tends to damage them enough to make them do a whale call	30
1	Someone's going through my account and downvoting everything. Like I give a fuck. 😂	30
1	"HAES, unless I deem your size to be a trigger."	30
1	Why in the fucking fuck do these old fatties think they need to dress like a god damned princess. FFS she looks 40 not 10.	30
1	I love happy endings. Hopefully civilized society will see this and stop the HAES movement.	30
1	You're about to lose your fist forever	30
1	Oh definitely, I just meant that normally her face is shopped smooth.	30
1	Second thought,  *"Curwen was also ordered to pay £200 costs and an £80 victim surcharge and was banned from owning or keeping animals for 10 years"*  Holy fuck. She isn't fit to own an animal for 10 years, and she has 3 kids at age 24? What the fuck kind of logic is that. She should have her kids removed and the government should mandate she ties her tubes so she can't pump out more little animal abusing fatties.	30
1	The only downside to punching that is you have to touch it	30
1	I hate to have a nit-picky nerd moment but Bombur was a dwarf.	30
1	Fat Emperor Palpatine??  http://www.cinemablend.com/images/news_img/66911/Star_Wars_Episode_VII_66911.jpg	30
1	Seriously there are no accounts during his lifetime that have been actually verified. And the other two sources outside the bible have been widely discredited. Calling him a historic figure is quite generous.	30
1	No, [this](http://th03.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2013/261/b/8/the_power_of_abs_by_tonyr-d6mujdm.jpg) is a perfect belly.	30
1	/u/HomerSimpsonXronize confirmed for xerxes.	30
1	If you read his book, you will see that he changes his hair(all of the head hairs) after he's done with a role. He doesn't normally have the same mustache as Ron Swanson. Also his book is awesome and you should read it anyway	30
1	if he really had a good life, he wouldn't need to justify himself to a stranger	30
1	I love how "wealthy parents" is something he feels is worth listing in the reasons he's better than you	30
1	I bet it's a Seal Team Six, ghost recon black ops sniper too.	30
1	Why do they always assume that you aren't just as successful, if not more so, than they are? Besides, "hot wife" is relative in those circles.	30
1	Oh god thats hilarious.  he could use some acne but other than that its perfect	30
1	That is one hell of a deep dig to hit such a nerve.	30
1	"It must suck to be that angry at the world." :')	30
1	If you drink the same stuff through 2 straws, only a quarter of the calories count. Didnt you know?	30
1	She and thanks :)	30
1	You aren't being downvoted for being bi, it's because of what you said about fit women.	30
1	I bet it's mother is 600lbs and cleans pools for a living	30
1	I'd settle for her legs rotting off followed by a prolonged death due to a stroke.	30
1	What about, "it is for my other personalities"?	30
1	exactly. This just screams I'm sad and alone in a filthy basement wearing adult diapers because my fat made me incontinent.	30
1	As a girl with small boobs and flat stomach, this makes me feel better	30
1	Does getting fat cause people to grow more body hair? Her forearm looks like a mans.	30
1	As a native southern Californian, I am pretty sure we're given flip flops in the nursery, and I still wouldn't jump a fire pit in flip flops. It's just not the safest thing ever.  .. of course, I wouldn't jump a fire pit at all, because why?	30
1	Would you change your mind if everything was covered in ranch?	30
1	&gt;Wealthy parents  &gt;Hot horny wife  LMAO! In its dreams, in its dreams.	30
1	"A fat fuck named Darth Vader. He betrayed and murdered your father"	30
1	The after looks like a guy with a wig trying to look like her.	30
1	I think his "hot" wife might be a butterbeast.	30
1	The first rule of being better than anyone, is not having to convince yourself and others of it.	30
1	She looks like a Hunger Games reject.	30
1	OP should poke it with a pole.	30
1	She's shredded... or is it melted?	30
1	20 lbs over weight at 30 turns into 50 lbs overweight at 35, turns into dead and not enjoying your paid fro retirement by 50.	30
1	The sad reality is there there are SJW Tubblrbeasts that come awfully close to this.	30
1	She 100% could be elected to the Senate, especially in Illinois.	30
1	Hanging onto her glory days like she hangs onto Ronald McDonald.	30
1	And have her ovaries removed. Fuck.	30
1	Fuck ranch is disgusting.	30
1	**&gt;** Wife  **&gt;** Job  **&gt;** Friends  **&gt;** Redditor  wat.	30
1	Shit I wasn't even born here (moved here very young) and I have unexplainable patriotism. I'm not obnoxious about it and I love other countries too but it's just a sense of pride.	30
1	HAHAHA, perfect.  Even if some sick fuck wanted to rape her, there's no way they could get past her fupa. It's like the ultimate barrier.	30
1	Poor feminist movement. All the fatties ate it and shit out tumblr.	30
1	I never said the U.S. was the best, see you already have this attack attitude about you and you start putting words in my mouth similiar to how the hammies attack anything that disagrees with them. It's not a competition about who is best or what country is better. I am simply proud of my country and answering your question whether I would die or not for it. And if you really do roam all over the place what would you know about culture and loyalty? much less a country on the other side of the Atlantic?	30
1	That is quite funny yet there's a part of me that knows that it's much too close to some fatty's reality.	30
1	I've never been more proud to be part of a subreddit before.  Fuck you fat ass butter beasts	30
1	I'm strictly an olive oil and balsamic person. Maybe a mustard-based dressing once in a blue moon.	30
1	omg this was fucking killer. 10/10	30
1	I can't at them always calling those bodies unrealistic. They know those are actual real-life people in the world, right? People like that photo actually exist.	30
1	Yep, running is so unrealistic and unhealthy. Being fit obviously endorses anorexia and unreachable expectations.	30
1	All these butter trolls are failures. They are failures that celebrate giving up. They all believe being fat fucking failures is something to be brave and proud of. They all make me sick	30
1	I'm so fucking tired of being called unrealistic and that I don't exsit. Am I a ghost? AM I NOT HERE IN FRONT OF YOU?  You know what's unrealistic? For some shitlady like me to eat 10,000 calories a day and balloon up to 400lbs. I will literally kill myself in the process.	30
1	It's all up to an individuals preferences. I love girls with abs because it shows that they are motivated and have passion. It's extremely attractive to me.	30
1	Well, feeling entitled to things without putting in the work is what fatties do. Like feeling entitled to being thought of as attractive without actually working at having an attractive body.	30
1	&gt; She decided to indulge herself...  I don't think much deliberation took place before she "decided" to indulge herself...	30
1	It's a terrible job, but somebody's got to do it.	30
1	Are these hambeasts ever shopping at whole foods?	30
1	aparently its dissapointing and unrealistic to look like you work out and exercise and run and just fucking be healthy god damn i HATE fat people what the fuck	30
1	Then how do you get your servings of mayo? Sounds like you might be body shaming others by not having multiple serving of mayo with every meal. Think of the feefees you're hurting.	30
1	I mean, he said she was hot and horny, not that she was actually swinging from his undoubtedly inverted diq. She could be with him for the money and fucking hot guys on the side.	30
1	"I have slightly-larger-than-average tits that are made of actual breast tissue instead of fat, which is an automatic swipe right"	30
1	Just FYI she lost quite a bit of weight on a TV show called "My 600-lb life".  At the end, and even now, she's still overweight, but not nearly as bad as this. In fact she seemed the most motivated.  But as you can see it is a major problem, in some circles an "addiction". Even though she was the most effective, she still had these massive "cheat" days.  The other people were a LOT worse.  (this one lady stopped going to the doctor after her surgery and is STILL 500+ pounds).  Just looked her up and she's still pretty fat.	30
1	Size 20 is apparently "small", wtf.	30
1	She has three asses, and all of them are just the worst.	30
1	*looks at picture*   Yup, most likely. No idea how they actually think they're cute when they're clearly showing their fat just hanging. The delusion is real and I'm sad.	30
1	It's true. I'm so sorry.  I'm going to hit the drive thru right now and make myself eat a supersized meal with an XL diet coke. I don't want to be a shamer anymore.	30
1	WE WILL ALWAYS PREVAIL. UPVOTES FOR ALL!	30
1	They act as if eating non-gluttonous portions and going for a run once a week is as difficult as climbing K2.	30
1	By being appointed the queen of Tumblr by its citizens.	30
1	That's not a horse, that's a rhino.   Oh, oh the thing on the bottom. Yeah, that's a horse.	30
1	Exactly. Celebrating your body if you're fit somehow shames people, but being a disgusting blob and putting your body on display is incredibly brave!	30
1	The fuck. ..apparently you're not fat until you're actually near death from all the fat on your body?	30
1	When you know that you look good why would you want to go and destroy your body? I guess the allure of french fries and chicken nuggets was too difficult to resist.	30
1	Rush Limbaugh is fat, therefore every word out of his mouth is completely worthless just like he is	30
1	You just gave me yet another reason not to vote for Christie. Thank you.	30
1	seriously, if you say hot horny wife, that's more of an instant to them. there's a reason most say beautiful, saying hot horny just makes him want to have the world revolve around him	30
1	Jelly Boulder made me laugh.  It is also the perfect description of that thing.	30
1	"18 inch double sausage triple pepperoni bacon Texas BBQ salami quadruple cheese nightmare heart attack special, with olives, please. I'm watching my figure."   Fucking LOL	30
1	You mean life "endings".	30
1	We'll bang, ok?	30
1	I don't know how that's unrealistic. That's pretty damn close to my body, except I'm not gray. Am I holding my daughter to unrealistic standards when I wear a sports bra and shorts to run?	30
1	I believe in America, the average woman wears a size 12. Also, women's sizes constantly change, it's called vanity sizing.  http://time.com/3532014/women-clothing-sizes-history/	30
1	Thousand Island is Ranch Dressing's level III obese aunt with too many cats.	30
1	Well I have all of that and a 12" dick.	30
1	It's amazing how the delusion is so thorough.  These are undoubtedly the same whales who screech about how they look so "hot/cute/sexy" while modeling their cottage cheese-filled trashbag legs.  And then they turn around and try to act like OP's lovely slender legs are some hideous adipose monstrosity.  Why haven't we classified fat as a mental illness yet?	30
1	I don't think it's a vest I think it's a tank top	30
1	Her head is diseased and needs to be amputated too.	30
1	That is totally an insult to children. My children are natural shitlords.	30
1	So I don't want to be *that guy*, but no personal info right? Yet you just posted her DL number?   Of course, this ham went through the trouble of covering her address, and left her *license number and birth date* on for the internet to see. The fat has seeped into the brain...  EDIT: Who am I kidding, I love being that guy.	30
1	Sure. Fine. Every body that can physically make it to the beach is beach body ready. But whether you're going to make people stare in lust and envy, or see their faces crinkle in disgust still remains to be seen once you take your clothes off. :)	30
1	Well if you're 17. You're unfortunately in violation of the rules for this sub. I'm sorry but you are most likely going to be banned soon.	30
1	*"My mother made big waves"*  Your whalehood is showing	30
1	Doesn't make a difference :(	30
1	So hard to upvote, but here you go anyways.	30
1	the noose just looks like another neck roll. at a glance i didn't even notice it was a noose.	30
1	Is that a diaper?	30
1	Fat people eat A LOT. They won't just eat the sausage, they'll coat it in ranch and wash it down with a few liters of Coke.   There's some documentary on Youtube where some fat guy explains how he got fat. He admits to eating something like 20 hot dogs in one sitting.	30
1	That....that doesn't make any sense....your legs are perfectly slender and smooth...I'm jealous. Shouldn't an insult have a tiny bit of truth to it so that it's actually insulting. Calling a slim girl chunky is beyond stupid and pointless.	30
1	She is literally more than twice as heavy as me. And she's lost weight. Still losing. (Yes, I'm proud.)	30
1	OP there's no reason to lie for karma, you could have just reposted the picture. But don't say some random dude from a picture that's been floating around on reddit and the internet is hitting on your girlfriend lol.   For example  http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate/comments/2vdm3d/i_was_bored_when_i_took_this_lol_i_look_cute/	30
1	I'll always see you from a distance first. Good luck hiding those "curves" , fatty	30
1	Vanity sizes fuck everything up. My jeans from high school are size 8, my jeans I bought last week are a 4. Both fit the same.   12-14 is a large and plus sized is considered 16 and up. Most stores don't go passed 16.	30
1	Your logic is sound. #HATRS!	30
1	Oh god here we go again. The next Protein World type marketing being bullied by these pigs	30
1	Well yes, they're real in the sense that they're not made out of pixie dust. Beautiful on the other hand...	30
1	My disgusting fat fuck boss uses baby talk all the time! She's sixty and morbidly obese and says "can you pweeeaaase come help me" in baby talk and makes a frowny face...god I want to fucking punch her just thinking about it. Does she think it makes her cute? You're disgusting. Stop.	30
1	Indeed it is. Lot of bronies who are diaper fetishists.	30
1	18+ sub dude. Might wanna delete this comment	30
1	Normal person sees Protein World ad: "I want to look like that. What needs to be done to achieve that body or as close as I can get to it?"  Fat person sees Protein World ad: "That ad that is not directed toward me for a product I don't use is offensive. It should be taken down because it makes me uncomfortable. Where's the nearest McDonald's? I have some feelings that need to be eaten."	30
1	What... Why would someone be turned on by diapers.	30
1	who the fuck frames a fucking frozen picture?	30
1	I think it's a tarp.	30
1	We don't have enough fuel on Earth to send that much weight into space.	30
1	Sorry friend, come back when you are 18.	30
1	Just gonna *sneak* those last two in at the end.	30
1	Hahaha omg you're the best, I want to make #HATRS a thing!	30
1	It could actually be HATERS- Healthy At The Exact Right Size	30
1	If everyone's beautiful, then nobodies beautiful. We can't all be cream of the crop.	30
1	What? Who "whacks it" every night when he has a girlfriend? And if they are in an LDR, why don't they do it together over Skype? Is there something I am missing here?	30
1	Lookin' good top row. Burgundy suit, not quite, darlin. The rest of you crawl back into the ocean where you belong.	30
1	Guess it's time for another installment of Guess The Bodypart.	30
1	Watch the obeasts reappropriate that and say 'any size is the right size' or some shit. We shitlords just can't have nice things. 😢	30
1	Haven't you heard? Capslock is cruise-control for cool.	30
1	I feel body shamed by this.	30
1	I know a lot of people like to shit on Urban Outfitters, but I love their jeans because they size women's jeans kind of like men's. I fit into the 24W 29L size, or the 25W when I've been running more.	30
1	Last time I tried the poem was so big Reddit charged me for computer crimes, their servers choked on my big cock lines and huge ball rhymes.	30
1	Cushing's disease? Pretty odd fat distribution.	30
1	"Slut" would probably be the last word I thought of while viewing that picture.	30
1	fat girl angle shot doesn't work in real life	30
1	Do it! Let's get it trending.	30
1	THIS is how the fatties get fat. It isn't mainly portion control or overeating (while it can be that, look at the best competitive eaters. They're usually either swole or skinny). It's the soda and the Beetusbux. The liquid empty calories that just add nothing to you. Only type of soft drink I'll even have is a root beer to treat myself during a special occasion (birthday, holiday, etc). Besides that it's water for me. Soda and other sugary liquid garbage is the main contributor to fat and weight gain.	30
1	Why the fuck is she nursing on it like an infant??	30
1	The one person in the store who *actually* needs it gets shamed by fat assholes who could benefit from a little walking once in a while. I hope you told them that you need it because of recent surgery and not a lifetime of poor lifestyle choices.	30
1	Jesus, if a fucking grocery bag offends you that much you need to reevaluate your life decisions. At some point it's not about Protein World, or the grocery bag, or whatever else you want to blame.   It's you. The common factor is always you.	30
1	Wow. Further proof that fatties are just giant babies.   You're not supposed to stick the bottle that far in your mouth. It's not a bottle.	30
1	Idk not even hams tend to enjoy entirely raw meat, that's probably why they weren't cooked before hand made it easier to get the shot with fewer restraints.	30
1	Just for reference, the XXL is a size 18-20. Butterhuffer, you're also a liar.	30
1	Ugh. I'm not surprised. Theater hams are the worst.	30
1	A size 20 is what we use to cover the picnic table.	30
1	Pretty sure he's over the weight limit for that changing table behind him.	30
1	Op swole af. Hambeast fat af. Fat and swole do not mix.	30
1	No shit! What about *my* daughter who has defined abdominal, bicep and quadricep muscles? One day I'll probably come home to tears of her being bullied for having a strong body.   Hell, it's already happening, she just doesn't see it for what it really is.	30
1	So are [furries](http://www.cringechannel.com/2015/03/10/picture-just-a-typical-walmart-employee/)  They seem to all be in the same overlapping circle of fetishes	30
1	I love this  &gt;*UP TO SIZE 32	30
1	There is this thing called THE INTERNET and it has the total collected knowledge of the entire human race on it. It's free, available to everyone everywhere, and has lots of information on dieting, weight loss, exercise, and every other topic you can think of.   If you can use the internet to whine you can use it for other purposes.	30
1	Lmfao "XXL works best for my body".. That's a problem, not something you want to accomodate.	30
1	But they're not real womyn! They're either photoshopped or have been oppressed into thinking that physical activity and appropriate calorie consumption is healthy. /s	30
1	It's not any restaurants job stop people from overeating, just like Macy's can't tell me "You bought enough pairs of socks. Stop buying socks."	30
1	It looked to me like the orange hue was missing even up to the nose as well. I thought it might've been from her feed bag.	30
1	But us tall people have to look at your fat ass face all the time. No thank you.	30
1	Yes! Big waves!	30
1	Well, she didn't qualify it.  She *does* have a perfect belly.  - for punching - for scaring small children - for modelling living room drapes - for motivating the rest of the world how not to look - neighbourhood firemen can use it as a trampoline in a pinch	30
1	Instead of finding ways to avoid being fat, they try to hide it in any facet of life.   This shit disgusts me and us tall guys need to shitlord to the max at all times because of this mindset.	30
1	I get indulging, but who's so greedy that they drink two drinks at once?	30
1	What can I say? I'm the dominant type.	30
1	Because lying is the best way to start a new relationship.	30
1	I'd say the whole bottom row honestly	30
1	Never thought I'd use this account twice. There are shitlord AB/DL (adult baby/diaper love) fetishists out there. Harder to find because fat fucks like lazy fetishes where they can literally just sit in their own filth and be catered to - but they do exist! It's usually just a variation of BDSM where one partner is dominant and the other is subordinate/humiliated through infantile things.	30
1	That is some strong delusion.	30
1	Maybe he's a nice guy, so it's all allowed!	30
1	It's a way to invalidate those women and make them feel self-conscious. The obeasts think, "If I can make her feel worse about herself than I feel about myself, then I will feel better about myself by comparison!" It has to do with feelings, not logic.	30
1	The butter barge probably misread it as Flabletics Active wear.	30
1	I love that their baseline biological urges as actually just straight females (regardless of how they "identify") will be something that will always expose them. No amount of SJW keyboard feminazism will protect them from the fact that what they pretend to hate -- straight, fit, tall, tanned dudes -- is actually what they crave. Hypocritical, lying tubs of grease. You're not even fooling yourselves.  Edit: removed white	30
1	What a fat tub of shit. Of all fat people, this has to be the worst. You can be the loudest tumblrina in the world and I wouldn't care, but fuck; when you start forcefeeding your kids and washing their brains with fatlogic - that's where I draw the line.	30
1	Well when you need a paint roller to put it on and they only give you an artists brush what do you expect?	30
1	The children they raised with their same lazy attitude will be though. We should just give them West Virginia and build a wall up around it so they don't burden our healthcare system any more.	30
1	a quick google search gives two results  http://i.imgur.com/PEFzXN7.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/bfn3NJg.jpg	30
1	"Stop weight bigotry."  Are you kidding me?!  Get fucked!  How about you start taking a little responsibility for your gluttonous ways and maybe stop after the 4th Big Mac.  And also, if *anybody* can explain the infantile 'thing' that fat girls seem to be in to and why they're into it, I'd be much obliged, because right now to my brain this whole scene just does not compute.	30
1	Health At The Evolutionary Right Size.	30
1	You may have just placed yourself on a watch list. But I'm in the same boat, in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence, their fee fees prevail.	30
1	Write "feed her" on a fit woman's picture, no one bats an eye.  Write "starve her" on a fat woman's picture and everyone loses their minds.	30
1	That's what makes this place work. Everyone is thinking it, now we have a place to openly talk about it.	30
1	reminds me of 1984 and "mini plenty"	30
1	Awesome! The butter bomb is perfect.  And the pill container is exactly what I imagined. More of these need to happen.	30
1	&gt;I don't think she really understands male sexuality...which makes sense.  Or sexuality period really.	30
1	I'm wondering at what point people will be living like in "Wall-E".	30
1	I legit thought this was a baby from the thumbnail.	30
1	I mean, its hard for some people because you actually have to use some crazy logic here..  1. Work out Clothing is for people who are very active.  2. People who are very active and need a lot of workout clothes, workout a lot.  3. People who workout a lot are not lazy and care about their body.  4. People who care about their body don't let them pant size go over 20.  Done.	30
1	&gt; The advertising company clearly does not have daughters!!!  The stupid is strong in the last comment.	30
1	Those types of comments on pics of fit women are just so pathetic. We all know that those comments come from either jealous fat bitches or butthurt jealous low tier men who hate anybody who's out of their league.	30
1	24 year old here, can confirm that you're wrong.   PS XD	30
1	The way I see it, it can go one of two ways:  1.) Fit, and even average by extension, women get sick of their shit and constantly being shamed for being thin or "anorexic" and stop enabling them with posts about how beautiful they are, effectively stopping the FA movement.  2.) Full blown Wall-E in 5 years.	30
1	He'd get a weird look, make up a whole story about that look and post it on Tumblr #effyourdiaperstandards	30
1	They're like ostriches.  Really fat ostriches.	30
1	Oh, but a ham can dream...	30
1	At risk of sounding like a conspiritard, I really don't think the U.S wants a fit or active population anyway outside of the military. Keep the citizens fat, docile, and stupid so there's no risk of anyone protesting or putting up a fight.  I kinda think this is what our government wants. And media just says anything as long as they get paid.	30
1	Man, that is one punchable face.	30
1	I don't know about you, but I'm not willing to give up on [views](http://armedwithvisions.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/the-last-mountain-original.jpg) [like](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/High-point-north-fork-mountain-wv_-_West_Virginia_-_ForestWander.jpg) [these](http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/misty-mountain-sunrise-west-virginia-mirror-image-thomas-r-fletcher.jpg).

1	I just don't even understand.  This is the moment I lose my mind over a phrase.  Junior plenty.	30
1	Regardless if whether or not you find abs on females attractive, the point is that the girl put in serious work for her goal and should be applauded, not treated as if she did something to hurt herself. Had she won a pie eating contest, they'd call her a champion.	30
1	You lost their attention at cream.	30

1	Old enough to put down a fork and stop my self from stuffing face.	30
1	I was curious as well and actually tried to eat as much calories as possible within one day. I managed to get to 9000 calories with around 2500 coming from sodas alone. At the end of the day i felt so sick i wanted to throw it all back up again, it took me around two days to feel like a human being again. It boggles my mind how some people could do that on purpose for years, but then again hamplanets arent human	30
1	Hams, uh, find a way.	30

1	How can you just admit that about yourself and not feel like the most pathetic piece of shit in the world?  You know you are fat and refuse to do anything about it. That's fucking disgusting. Get out.	30
1	Christie should run though. Not for office, just in general. May do some geological damage though. Not sure.	30

1	"pizza because it's a vegetable" lol @ diets based on the food groups	30

1	&gt;I know that I am fat  Then you should know whats coming...  Banned  -CAW	30
1	There's a startling amount of accuracy in this post	30
1	You're too skinny, you should eat a stick of butter while you're at it...you look like you're anorexic!	30
1	I will never understand all these people who get "triggered" by fit, healthy bodies. When I see a picture of someone in better shape than me it inspires me to work harder on my own physique.	30
1	A severely visually impaired guy could still feel the unnatural fat folds--and could definitely *smell* them.  The tactile sensation would be enough to repel them.  I like how they don't want to be judged on appearance, but they'd never have sex with the neckbeard white knights on Tumblr who kiss up to them.	30
1	Nope, but fortunately somebody has invented a tool for that...y'know...for science?	30
1	That stupid logic.    "If everyone looks like shit, then no one looks like shit!"	30
1	With makeup on it says I'm 14. Without makeup, 23. I'm 30. I'll take it.	30
1	Give one good reason you think it should live. Name one thing it contributes, or one redeeming quality. THERE ARE NONE OF THE ABOVE, HAVE YOU EVEN SEE THE MONSTERS?!	30
1	&gt; A severely visually impaired guy could still feel the unnatural fat folds--and could definitely smell them.  The tactile sensation would be enough to repel them.  Hmm... I guess that's true.   "But if you date a tall, blind and a touch/smell sensory deprived guy..."	30
1	You're jokin', you're jokin'  I can't believe my eyes   You're jokin' me, you gotta be  Her weight is too high  She's ancient, She's ugly   I don't know which is worse  I might just split a seam now  If I don't die laughing first	30
1	For that matter, SJWs lack the self-awareness to even *consider* blind people as romantic partners.	30
1	Can anybody explain this 'Wearethethey" bullshit to me?  I've only seen it in the past couple days and I have no idea WTF it is...I only know it's another hashtag that fats have glommed on to.	30

1	That's enough food for atleast 4 people, snacks for atleast 10.. Do they eat like this everyday? 🐋	30
1	This....all of this.   I nearly cried from laughing.	30
1	Sadly that's what is going to happen. Fatties think they're entitled to everything, including our own hashtags	30
1	That's the problem with fatties. They seem to think they deserve a reward after staving off the smallest craving or walking five feet and end up stuffing themselves. The reward is not being fat when you control your diet, not some disgusting snack in place of another smfh	30
1	&gt; I'm guessing made from adamantium  FTFY	30
1	Spend a couple hours on fetlife. About 98% of the bdsm lifestyle members are fat fucks.	30

1	You would think having a FUPA so large you can place it on a counter would be a massive wake up call.  Guess not.	30
1	I.. I think I would rather fuck.. yes I do believe I would rather fuck a fresh corpse.  At least it would be fresh, unlike this adipose behemoth.	30
1	**"Just got my doctorate! So glad to be above my master's!"**  "You were smart before that's very motivational for people who have a lot to learn and are struggling.

"Send him to Cern and he'll really know what it's like to get smart"	30
1	You've never been shown healthy habits?      Have you tried [Google](http://i.imgur.com/TZCWiCJ.jpg)?	30
1	They buy tons of organic, gluten free versions of junk food and then complain about not losing weight since they're eating 'so healthy!!'	30
1	Jesus Christ he doesn't even remember eating food, I didn't know fatties could reach that level	30
1	Fatties are great at doublethink	30
1	I seriously hope they didn't bury her. She'd take up too much ground. They better have cremated her.	30
1	OP is a true bro.	30
1	I hear you! Yet if we turned round and said, maybe I should eat some of yours I'm the asshole! My new response to being told I look to skinny is "only in comparison" they don't know how to respond to that and usually shut up	30
1	This... cannot be a real conversation.  If I ever saw this on my feed I'd come out officially as a shitlady because that shit is fucking nonsense.  It's getting to the point where fit people are having to feel ashamed of themselves for existing, taking care of your body is triggering and mean to others...   No more fuckin' coddling, no more ignoring.  If I EVER see this kind of crap I'm speaking up.  I will not allow these fat squeaky wheels to get any more greased up than they already make themselves.  Fuck them.	30
1	As a cat lover, I am livid. I want her to be mauled by a fucking tiger, what a cunt.	30

1	Kinda hard for there not to be waves when a whale hits the water	30
1	This post made it kind of click how similar they are to neckbeards.	30
1	Some feminists indeed believe that men cannot think about anything else than sex and are all potential rapists because of the patriarchy.  Don't ask me how it makes sense because it doesn't. Feminists rarely make any sense.	30
1	I guess it depends what you consider plus size. According to UK sizing I would be like a size 10-12 (5'6, 135 lb, 34C-27-38) and I wouldn't consider myself overweight (maybe height is a good consideration though, since I'm about 2" taller then most women). Here's [reference](http://imgur.com/QZkNmTJ) (sorry for the angle - it's few months old as I'm now 9 months pregnant). Here's another one since that one looks like I'm sucking my [tummy](http://imgur.com/sCMQ0uB) in.  edit: links didn't work right.	30
1	Those nose rings are supposed to go through the septum of domestic cattle, which is totally appropriate in this instance.	30
1	That article just screams parental neglect. Selective eating since the age of TWO? So her mother just decided to cave in to the whining of a two-year-old child and feed it whatever it cried for, rather than promote re-establishing proper eating habits?  Lazy shit parenting right there.	30
1	She looks 45 so I'll just assume she is 22 in reality.	30
1	"Such fierce. Much Diabetes. Wow."	30
1	I wonder if any starving kids in Africa have this condition.	30
1	People with this made up condition never selectively eat low calorie foods or healthy meals. It's an excuse to gorge on pizza, cheesy fries, and beetus juice.	30
1	Tumblrina logic is to embrace what society finds repulsive and passive aggressively owning it even though they know they're disgusting blobs of candy colored shit.	30
1	Find a pointy object and "accidently" stab it a few times.	30
1	Fat or no fat, that is not acceptable.	30
1	Ah, the good-ole' "If you look like an actual human being and I'm a fucking fatass, you *must* have a small dick" response. Yep, jelly ham confirmed.   Jelly ham... that sounds like something she would down in a second, now that I think about it...	30
1	The fact that food that has disappeared without you remembering any interaction with it can be SAFELY ASSUMED to have been eaten by you is the saddest shit I've ever heard.	30
1	You'd think watching fat people die young would spark an end to HAES and Fat Acceptance BS... Sadly, it's doing the opposite and it isn't making an impact. I don't understand why this isn't opening their eyes to change.	30
1	Of course - they're equal to them in every way. Both think they **deserve** tall, fit, well-built partners because *that's just what they're attracted to ok?*	30
1	But what about all the obese people who have gotten skinny and say the same thing?	30
1	It's true. :(  I did go to McDicks for lunch as I was on the road, and I couldn't finish my meal. It felt so gross. How can people eat this filth all the time? I'd rather just not eat.	30
1	That and the basement dweller life - order shit in, masturbate and sleep all day, unless on some form of "social media" circlejerking about the stupidest shit... put down your equals of the other gender, etc.	30
1	Are you kidding? The amount of fuel youd have to use would use up the rest of our reserves. Just let it decompose in the forest or something	30
1	Funny how the probability of any given individual wearing lace-up shoes is inversely proportional to how overweight they are compared to a normal human being. I guess when you've got a gut that huge, bending over &amp; compressing it long enough to tie a pair of shoes restricts their breathing to the point of passing out.	30

1	Can someone put this in the sidebar pls	30
1	If you've never had coconut peanut ginger dressing, fucking try it, it's delicious!!!	30
1	Well they *deserve* you, duh! They're strong independent women who are looking for an equally strong independent man, so they can become more fat and dependent on you!	30
1	For the sake of everybody's best interest they should pierce it's lips together.	30
1	I'm borderline legally blind (around 20/200) without my glasses/contacts, and I can definitely notice if someone is a fatty. It's hard not to notice an enormous blob of bright fluorescent colors (because they never wear human clothes) that's several times as wide as a human should be.	30

1	he's denying their civil rights by denying them his shitlord cock.  that makes the Chemist as bad as histories worst maniacs.	30
1	I don't even have a concept of what a size 20 looks like in my head. I can imagine / think of someone who's every size until 14, but like it really falls off after that. Like is there really a "size 26" in the dress aisle? Is there such thing as "fitted" clothes for the obese? I thought everything becomes elastic, generous, one-size-fits-alls after a certain point because bodies become so amorphous past a certain size that it would be difficult to have a specific cut that accommodates everyone "that size."	30
1	I took the liberty of entering all that junk into MFP: http://imgur.com/xPSYdo3  Over 4,000 calories in one day. Good thing it's his cheat day ^tee^hee /s	30

1	Holy shit, I just thought of great way to keep fatties out of a bar.  Name it like 'The Barn' or 'The Cattle Pen'  In shape, normal sized people will go in and be like 'haha yeah, we're all a bunch of animals! Yeah! It's sexy!'  But if you're fat it's like cow, pig, other fat animals	30
1	What the fuck *is* that?	30
1	That is a lost cause waiting to die.	30
1	Is that a turd hanging out of its ass or a reflection of something?	30
1	Beauty is only a light switch away, but fat is still there.	30
1	Dose it even know it is shitting?! Has it gone full animal and now just shits/pissies when ever wherever?!	30
1	Pretty sure it's a diarrhea shitstain running down his asscrack, down the bus stop seat, and puddling onto the ground.  Yeah.	30
1	Men with low self-esteem think she's less intimidating because she's gross. It makes her easy to masturbate to.	30
1	I'm the fuck out.	30

1	OP is sexy as fuck. Also, she has an appropriate 'seaside' shirt so you can send her back to her kind.	30
1	Are you kidding? the nutrients released into the soil from her would mean the forest would take over the world	30
1	I'm not following her logic. Working out is not a simple solution because she hates herself and doesn't know healthy eating habits? Well boo-hoo, not everyone who's thin or fit grew up eating correctly. Take some personal responsibility, stop expecting friends/family/PERFECT STRANGERS to be your free personal fitness/life coach, get off your ass and help yourself. With all the calorie tracker apps, GPS walking apps, and weight loss apps, there's all the information you could possibly need. I'm SO SICK of hearing this crap!!!	30
1	No no no no no no no no no no noooooooooo  How is that real? How? Someone will have to clean that up, you worthless piece of leaking shit.	30
1	Ouch you hurt mai fee fees!  Banned for being tarded.	30
1	That's art. I love how her rucksack stripes look like part of your trousers.	30
1	It's funny because it's true.    Funny?  I mean sad.  For them.  Which is funny for me.	30
1	I don't think it's the nosering that makes her look fat, it's all that blubber around her. The nose ring is just so she fits in with the rest of the pigs at the farm.	30
1	&gt; it's a diarrhea shitstain running down his asscrack  I'm done. I'm done! No. There are things you do not do. What the actual fuck? The mother of nope.	30
1	Animals go in the corner...	30
1	I hate to be the dissenting voice here. I do statistical shape analysis (especially the head and face) and image processing, and although I'm remarkably hung over and know little about their algorithm here, it is likely skewed by two factors: the drastic makeup which would make identifying salient landmarks difficult, and Tessbeast would probably be a big (lol) outlier compared to their training set. That being said, she definitely fools the heuristic for age identification in my own brain, which probably fares better than this automated approach on average.	30
1	If it were a dog it would be put down.	30

1	In reference to OP, now that's what I call some nice eyebleach. ;)	30
1	I love how at that angle, the stripes from the arms feed perfectly to the stripes on the torso to create the effect that she's one amorphous, limbless blob of fat.	30
1	TIL Meninist is a Thing...	30

1	Rodents tend to just go with out regards to where they are. So maybe this thing is just  some sort of overgrown sewer rat.	30
1	Hormonal issues are a thing when you've gained enough fat. The men start to produce more estrogen and develop tits. The women get hairy. The genders start to blend after 100 lbs overweight.	30
1	How is the shit coming out of *there?* Is its asshole all the way up there? Does the asshole have a life of its own? Trying to escape the orbit and gravity of its master? What is all that liquid surrounding the diarrhea? Why am I still looking at it? So many questions..	30
1	Your sister!?? Damn and I thought I was unforgiving to fatties, cold blood.  Tell her if she spent all that time taking selfies on running it would be way easier to get a good pic	30

1	They just like to put their hands in their ears and yell "lalalalala can't hear you". These fuckwits are very much aware of how to lose weight. They just don't want to admit that they eat shit and waaaaaay too much of it, nor do they want to exercise anymore than getting up and walking to the fridge. The information pertaining to weight loss predates the damn Internet.	30
1	OP, I work at the tate modern art gallery in London, and I'm personally going to get you an exhibition set up, how's that sound?   PS: OK, I only work at the Tate Modern as a janitor.  PPS: OK I don't work at Tate Modern.	30

1	Here is yet another example of hammy delusion. They think, "It says Skinny on the package. If I eat it, I will become what it says."  Keep snacking little piggy!	30
1	Let me help.  [Eyes bleaches](http://imgur.com/a/8uXKD)	30
1	Hey, OP, I'm so sorry that you got fed the fat genetics at birth. Stay strong, all of us here at FPH weep for you and your faulty genetics, as you will, with certainty, become one of them. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but the genetics, you cannot outrun them.	30
1	Mantle plume, I'd wager.	30
1	What is it about so many online feminists that they can dish it out but they can't take it? It's not that they have a problem with gendered insults, just ones directed at them. Especially from people who fail the ideological purity test they demand of everyone. If he said she had a loose pussy you know she'd scream misogyny and insist it's somehow different than what she said. What has led these people to reduce feminism to sexist double standards and special pleading?	30
1	The baby platypuses are freaking adorable but I still like mine better!	30
1	I hate kids who are old enough to walk insist on sitting in the trolley/shopping cart.	30
1	This is total ham logic, but do you guys really count calories on vacation? I can't be bothered to balance my macros when 60% of my diet is alcohol.   The difference is, the other 51 weeks of the year are spent counting 'em.	30
1	Yours is boner-worthy. Mine is boner-neutral.	30
1	Nah, even hamsters have their potty corners and guinea pigs can be litter trained.	30
1	That fat bitch who hit the guy got me so angry. Fucking bitch has to make a scene for no reason. Rude piece of shit. I would've loved to see him hit her back.	30
1	I don't mean to sound like I'm disagreeing with that, that was just the statistic, to my knowledge. I don't mean to equate "average" with "normal" or "healthy"; the average is plus-sized, though I'm not sure at what size women's clothing is considered plus-sized. The average American woman's BMI is about 26.5, definitely overweight. It's mind-boggling, I have such a hard time believing that people let themselves get so overweight.  Edit for clarity	30
1	A ham co-worker said that she wants tall guy because it makes her look smaller.	30
1	The amount of mental gymnastics  required  for this to make sense is astounding	30
1	Can we start a website to store all the death of these fatties ? I already have a the perfect name: www.RestInPizza.com	30
1	This is cheating. You went to Walmart to find fatties?	30
1	It's like short hair. It looks edgy, ironic and flattering on a thin lady.	30
1	OP you're my hero. legendary shitlording.	30
1	I'm a feminist. I want men and women to be treated equally. What you are talking about is not a feminist. They say they are just like they say they're cute. They're actually misandrists. So, they say they're beautiful feminists when they're actually disgusting  misandrists.	30
1	You just made my ee heart happy	30
1	I'm gonna take a ride on the nope train now. I thought I'd seen it all, but this is a whole other level of disgusting.   I never thought I'd see the day when the watchpeopledie subreddit would actually seem an attractive alternative to these pictures.   Well played FPH, you win.	30
1	You've spelled Batteries wrong, I went to Walmart for batteries. These waddling boulders sucked me into their gravity fields.	30
1	This normalization of fatness just puts us shitlords in a better position to become special, unique-magical-unicorn-snowflakes of thinness. This sub just keeps me motivated. Fuck her smug fat face, though.	30
1	What genetics? I'm adopted, so I'm safe.	30
1	As a short guy who often gets rejected matter-of-factly because of his height, I think it should be more socially acceptable people whose disgusting bodies tell the tale of their gluttony and sloth, do thank you for your shitlordry.	30
1	When God says he's seen enough, that's when you know to call it a day.	30
1	Dude, OP, how do you make your abs so gigantic? Mine show, but yours literally erupt. Teach me your ways!	30
1	I stopped talking to her several years ago after she moved to Tennessee, though she does visit sometimes. And I have no interest in helping her bitch through a workout.	30
1	Sounds like fat sympathy to me.  Unless you mean that shooting himself is too painless and quick, not enough suffering for his bad choices?	30
1	Normally, this amount of cute would kill me, but in this case it was necessary. Thank you!	30
1	That's why I drew the lines, to discern the human out of the blob.	30
1	God she is perfect. idk if it's the fatties fault (probably, always), but the word 'belly' always makes me think of like a beer belly or like jelly. other than that it's just 'stomach' or 'tummy'	30
1	I didnt want to water it! It might mutate again!	30
1	&gt;BREAK, INTERNET!  This is the kind of shit that will do it, too	30
1	God that looks like the saddest event ever. The actual discussion only lasts for an hour and a half. How long you want to bet the feast is?	30
1	Have an upvote for making me read that in Sir David Attenborough's voice in my head.	30
1	Damn you! Yesterday was abs day!	30
1	Happy to oblige, m'shit.	30
1	The fact that she bought 3lbs of fried chicken with them leads me to believe she's done this to herself.	30
1	It's ok OP, it's ok. Here, let [Dr. Hibbert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D6_msdM8rU) explain to you the 5 stages of grief, you're at the denial stage.	30
1	What's the point of having an XXS of that size?? Vanity sizing is so stupid. I'm 5'2" and 105 lbs, and according to their sizing chart I'd fit into the XXS, but I don't think I'm petite enough to be *extra extra* small. It does nothing to boost my confidence to say I fit into that size, it's just confusing.	30
1	Fat sympathy? Mods?	30
1	Best believe there will be eating during the echo chamber--I mean discussion.	30
1	6.5 oz bag. 6.5 servings per container @140 calories per serving. 1 bag = 910 calories.	30
1	Spoken like a true shitlady!	30
1	...says "CrazyEyes"...	30
1	Sounds more like hes against suicide in that sense. He stated in another comment he is all for shitlording and fat shaming but immediate suicide is too far for him.	30
1	Doesn't work all the time but a lot of them feel self conscious looking at bathing suits when I'm near them. Good.	30
1	To be fair that would take time and effort.  Taking deceptive selfies are so much easier.	30
1	Agreed, if they won't euthanize her at least sterilize her.	30
1	TIL: I'm a special snowflake skinny unicorn!  Does that mean the jellybeans I shit out are calorie free?	30
1	Lol thanks. Just a combination of good genes + heavy squats + running to stay lean.	30
1	Bet I know why they walk away without a swimsuit so often.  "Look at that girl by the swimsuits. She's so skinny! She needs to eat a burger, that's so unhealthy. Speaking of burgers, I've been shopping for at least 20 minutes now, I'm STARVING!... But I've only got $40 on me, I can't afford this bikini and lunch at the same time. Oh well, onward to McDonalds!"	30
1	My guess was 47.	30
1	Perfect, concise, and strikes directly at the nerve. Can't wait to see how this one plays out. /grabs popcorn	30
1	Yes, because marketing/advertising departments and schools totally don't have a ton of women. Too busy with their gender studies degrees to study anything heavily math based, I take it.	30
1	Translation: I want a hot boyfriend/husband but I don't want to work on my own body.	30
1	16 of the 18 were thinking, "She's probably an easy score, and I've got vodka"  Another one was a feeder, and the last one was the most deplorable type of "human" possible.  Someone who actually does like fatties.	30
1	Can't tell if hambeast is delusional about herself, has an inflated belief of what "obese" is, or is just a gigantic hypocrite.	30
1	I am colour blind, not fat blind. Fuck	30
1	You know that she would have some bullshit replies ready if you asked her to justify her answer. 20 bucks say that she believes that everyone should find her beautiful.	30
1	I had to like the picture so I could find it again (it was in like the random photos tab). Kind of hurt liking it but sacrifices must be made :/	30
1	&gt; above Hi-Thai, near Main Gym  It'll be the closest they've ever been to one.	30
1	My first thought was skewed perceptions.  Probably thinks she is curvy...or average.   *shudder*	30
1	Well, that's enough reddit for today, I'm out.  How much vodka do you think it will take to kill the brain cells that just stored that image?	30
1	The health and beauty sign is pointing away from them.	30
1	do peoe pay taxes for "persons" like this?!	30
1	They want to date tall guys to "prove" to themselves that they aren't as unattractive as they actually are.	30
1	"The corner! Why didn't I think of that..."	30
1	I'm sore, and I thought your comment was really funny.	30
1	Doesn't she look as though she has an exciting life, yeah hanging out with her doesn't sound like a bore at all... I mean look at all the activities that you could do. Eat, sleep, don't wash, repeat	30
1	But nooooo she's AVERAGE... I don't know why these hams even try... they really are ruining dating sites for me though	30
1	Why does it have a brown muzzle?  Edit: My wife says it's a mixture of Cheetos dust and makeup that is the wrong color.	30
1	See I like just a *teeny* bit less tone than she has.  But sweet jesus if it were either marry the whale or be ignored by the model I'd be practicing my lonely look.	30
1	The vanity sizing is ridiculous. It is funny when hams say "I'm not fat, I'm only a size 20!"  They just have no idea of the proportions of a healthy body.	30
1	She's my older sister, 21 now. I'm only 17, I watched her grow my whole life, but would get yelled at if I called her fat	30
1	Oh that's real pizza, I thought it was like a speedo that looked like pizza	30
1	Are YOU shitting ME????? ...said the sidewalk.	30
1	Roger that.  This piercing on appropriately sized female = sexah.  This piercing on a Jumbo-sizer = Legit rooting prevention.	30
1	That's why these hosebeasts have to make up new kinds of "rape" like "stare rape."	30
1	Enough with the tattoos!  Every.Single.Ham.	30
1	This is probably the single worst thing I have ever seen on Reddit.	30
1	Thank you for providing this vital public service. Keeping hams off of the beach and away from public spaces should be the obsession of every shitlord. You are doing God's work.	30
1	See? More proof that even fat bastards don't want to date fat bastards.	30
1	You get what you put in, you fat fuck.	30
1	That's called life.	30
1	it's 95% "tits for dick" and bullshit "tell me a secret" crap   and 5% other people	30
1	All of the above.	30
1	So you're telling me we're not supposed to masterbate all day?	30
1	Put all those XX's together from the banners and you still wouldn't have their shirt sizes.	30
1	Diet and exercise are better than free! You actually save money by just putting the goddamn fork down and not eating so much! It's a miracle!	30
1	They think because they're good with their mouths when it comes to eating, that they're good when it comes to singing and acting. The more fat you have on your face, the less expression you can show. That's why there are so few fat actors that aren't typecast or comedy pieces.  If you are a whale, and I show up to an open mic and you're singing showtunes, for the love of Christ Almighty shove a Big Mac in it.   Fat theater kids are my trigger	30
1	They see me rollin'... we're HAES'in'...	30
1	The shoppers at my Whole Foods are mostly shitlords and ladies who look like they just got out of yoga class no matter what time of day it is. Also lots of normal looking shitlord families. The occasional fat will be hovering around the free samples and interior aisles where they keep all the junk food.	30
1	&gt; I like how they don't want to be judged on appearance, but they'd never have sex with the neckbeard white knights on Tumblr who kiss up to them.  To be fair, those guys are disgusting too. The true natural counterpart of the Fat Acceptance "all bodies are beautiful~" is the Nice Guy TM, who usually cries "nice guys finish last!!!!" as he masturbates to his coworker's Facebook bikini photos.	30
1	When you stare at as much loose, flabby skin on their body all day as they do, the reason for the mix-up becomes apparent.	30
1	I love how when they have these events the most professional photos they can find are their god damn tumblr selfies. It's exactly like how all the fat people on LinkedIn use selfies.	30
1	[Holy shit] (http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view4/4456875/hippo-gets-explosive-diarrhea-o.gif)	30
1	Could you imagine waking up under a fatty after a car accident?  *shudders*	30
1	Verified tall guy (6 foot 6 inches)   No angle can fix ugly.	30
1	I was amazed at how much money I saved when I joined a gym. I worked out on my lunch breaks, forcing me to pack a sandwich or leftovers instead of going out.	30
1	Her chest fat is folding in half and obscuring her tattoo. HOW	30
1	But why sing *that* song?  Regardless of whether this is for Districts, juries, or an audition, the song is inappropriate because of her age and gender. I mean,  she doesn't have to sing anything from *Hairspray*, there are other pieces that would suit her "look" and vocal range.	30
1	That depends on height. Tall women can be safely within normal BMI range at 10 or 12. Editing to add: unless vanity sizing is involved. Stupid vanity sizing.	30
1	I never even thought about that, honestly. Now that I think about it, I used to take an entire weekend of clothing in a converse shoe box. I'm a dude, so that makes a big difference, but a fat dude could never do that shit, haha	30
1	Even though I'm a grammar nazi with my own writing, it doesn't generally bother me when other people are more lax. But the lose/loose thing just pisses me off because holy fuck that's like second grade spelling test shit. And you're right, it's *always* fats who do it.	30
1	Is that John Candy?	30
1	I appreciate your concern, truly ! I am 5'5" and now 115 lbs , my lowest being 112. I had difficult times last year that cut my appetite but now I'm into fitness, massively thanks to this sub. I work out and eat like a champ. I guess college life tiring me out? I am in a highly competitive domain. I am only 18 too, so I guess I still have youth on my side? Thanks however. People like you are what make the people go round!	30
1	Shits like oil and water.  And whales have a lot of damn oil.	30
1	Who made these? Pay them more money!!	30
1	"Doc, you've gotta put me back under... and ban all visitors..."	30
1	27? I'm 27... she looks worse than my 55 yr old mother.	30
1	The tattoo looks like hands spreading ass cheeks.	30
1	I would've called the cops immediately. That's just disgusting!	30
1	No! Pigs are cute...	30
1	If it exists, there is someone out there with a fetish for it.  Don't feel too bad	30
1	B..but i like my slip on vans.. Don't give them to the hams pls	30
1	But see, even the 'inspiration' dress isn't made from satin-y polyester. I feel like satin always looks horrible and cheap, no matter the body type or level of craftsmanship.	30
1	No really, what is that? Dough?	30
1	100% of fatshion can be remade with discarded curtains or trash bags, and no one would be able to tell the difference.	30
1	It boosts the confidence of people who are actually an XXXL but can fit into XL clothing due to the changed sizing.	30
1	Wait, are you masturbating right now? While reading FPH?	30
1	First off- did 40 fucking people "like" that?  Second, the whole "unrealistic body image" thing started with models, who eat 1 garbanzo bean a day to stay 92 lbs and 6' tall.  Having a picture of a person in workout clothes working out is NOT UNREALISTIC BODY IMAGE JESUS CHRIST	30
1	Nope! Fph is the only thing that stops me from rubbing my dick raw!	30
1	This seems like a good model for hell...locked in a room watching Myles' body positive dancing for eternity.	30
1	What does that caption say?	30
1	Guess the gender... Also I really need eye bleach!	30
1	It says "I could throw up" in Icelandic.	30
1	[Here's some bleach!](http://www.hdwallspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/korean-girl-hd-wallpaper.jpg)^^^^Added ^^^^by: ^^^^HonorYourBeetus	30
1	They are used to feeling like crap with crap food. They think its normal.	30
1	I can't fathom this as normalcy. We weren't doing anything today due to travel, but if we feel like this tomorrow vacation is ruined.  Maybe they've built an immunity to the shit feeling.	30
1	Tess, I want you to be the new face, the image, nay! the *spirit* of Derelicte	30
1	Preach it, that shit drives me crazy. How can you lose weight when you can't even spell the word lose?	30
1	Smile and it doubles your age.	30
1	Please post the whale's reaction	30
1	Needs moar baked beans.	30
1	If you're with someone you love and know the expectations of the relationship then it's just as normal/healthy as any other relationship.	30
1	By "hot", they just mean anyone who is not fat like themselves. Put it simply, fat people think fat is gross, but non-fat people have to find them attractive regardless or else it is "shallow".	30
1	Would make for a decent campaign. Have a succinct mural of a headshot, age &amp; cause of death.   Then when it has a nice wall of the dead be able to use to share around.   SURLY when fatties scroll through page upon page of other fatties who died from organ failure they'll have to accept that it's more than a co-inky-dink	30
1	She is. 27 people worth of lard-matter. As for her age... we cut her in half and count the rings, right?	30
1	That's no moon...	30
1	Frodo=&gt;Froyo	30
1	That guy is thinking "aw fuck not you again!"	30
1	Everyone seems so surprised that his doctor wasn't afraid to bring up a regular health issue and follow it up with a real prescription.	30
1	Latex, like spandex and yoga pants, are a privilege not a right.	30
1	Life hack: be a short guy.	30
1	She's thirsty for the ocean because she's a whale not a mermaid.	30
1	STOP PIG SHAMING. ONLY FAT SHAMING. PIGS ARE CUTE AND NICE.	30
1	I think they call that a Monte Cristo.	30
1	Health Actually Takes Exercise and Restriction Stupid.  Eh, I don't like that I had to use an and.	30
1	A doctor being doctor-like? Whoooaaaaaaaahhh!	30
1	You're welcome! The number of beached whales rises every year. I'm just doing my small part in helping out the environment.	30
1	Diet and exercise free? Must be a scam! Now we're the diet pills you skinny bitches keep hiding from us Curvy girls to shame us! :P	30
1	Vonnegut said that smoking was the classy, slow method of suicide.  I guess obesity is the quicker, more grotesque way to end your life.	30
1	Lots of people have fetishes. I come here to hate fats, not judge my fellow shitlord brethren for their kinks.	30
1	Yeah, maybe pizza dough. It expands a lot if it sits out too long. Like, a lot more than you'd expect.   How do I know? I worked a summer in a pizza restaurant and forgot to put some dough in the fridge in time.   I was not a popular guy that day.	30
1	If she fell into the tracks, nobody would be able to lift her out of there...	30
1	They make it sound like the store put a picture of anal sex on the bag.  *THINK OF TEH CHILDREN!!1*	30
1	Gotta have that salad to cancel out my two daily Big Macs, teehee!	30
1	She definitely has no idea she is obese.	30
1	Even where it's more expensive to eat (where a $40 weekly grocery budget is $80), fast food prices are even higher. I think. I don't know off the top of my head how much fast food costs.	30
1	Oh man, hahaha! Spot on, but I hear the term skinny bitch all too often so I'm pretty sure it would be "Look at that skinny bitch by the swimsuits."	30
1	HAES is leaking out.	30
1	She took a year off to expand her fupa	30
1	This isn't real, right?   Tell me this isn't real.  I am actually asking you to tell me this is not real.	30
1	America waddles on Dunkin'...	30
1	&gt;results are pretty worrysome  Never mind, as long as the Instagram angle is right and my makeup is slapped on and I'm calling myself cute, I'll be fine	30
1	Isn't it crazy how she plays the "small dick" card out of nowhere, and then has the audacity to ask him how old he is?  Fucking hams.	30
1	I bet that Starbeetus green tea lemonade is half syrup.  Had a lady come in to my shop once and ask for 16 pumps of classic syrup in a freaking medium. I wanted to tell her to just buy the syrup bottle and guzzle that; god damn. Disgusting.	30
1	True, poor piggies didn't deserve that insult. It isn't their fault the fatties try to copy them.	30
1	Most definitely a troll. Though, there are probably some people who actually think like this.	30
1	"Body shaming is so hurtful and you should never do it!"  "I bet you have a small penis."  lulz	30
1	Fuck the doctor for prescribing preventative medicine! Right!	30
1	Please tell me she isn't talking on speaker in the middle of a store. I hate that shit.	30
1	Wow, I haven't heard that one in years. Thank you.	30
1	Absolutely. No fuckin way anyone that delusional. Obvious troll is obvious.	30
1	Man, I was all chuffed until the woman went up and assaulted the guy... That's uncalled for. He's right; if he had hit her, people would be up in arms. MRA's are mostly nutters but they do have some good talking points.	30
1	If this is real, I have never been more angered by a fattylogic post.	30
1	[Hellllllooooooo OP.](http://i.imgur.com/Vu8Ov.gif) I'll take a can from your six pack, plz.	30
1	This is super rapey, I hope it is fake. Can you imagine if a guy was saying that to a girl? People would be fucking outraged, and they should be here too.	30
1	He has big hips for a dude.	30
1	The comic about the little thing that follows him around telling him to be fat(The Blergh or something similar) is pure gold	30
1	Lol I love this subreddit.	30
1	Triggered so hard she skips arguing and goes right to violence. Tumblrinas can't handle real life.	30
1	Evolution clearly did not intend the obese to reproduce.	30
1	What bothers me the most is that instead of people/evolution finding a way to weed these people out if the gene pool, lots of people are fucking protecting them. I know they *look* like an endangered whale species people but they need to go.	30
1	I was about to say what you said: reverse the genders and it should be knee-jerk horrifying to even the most radical SJWs.   The logic (or the lack thereof) here isn't so much fat logic, but a combination of entitlement and, well, rape. Substitute "fat" with any other quality and it's still rapey. "If a blonde woman wants to have sex with you, you do it no matter what," or "If a short woman," or "If a bald guy," etc etc.   &amp;nbsp;  So, I call troll.	30
1	Hypocritical as shit. Every woman is beautiful and healthy... Unless you're skinny. Or Average. Or just kinda fat. Or trying to lose weight.	30
1	I've been hearing a lot about this documentary and have seen it pop up on this sub. I'll have to watch it when I get back.  While I get how habits as a kid follow into adulthood, and how not being taught what's healthy and what's not, I don't get how they don't get curious and simply look it up?  I just have a hard time processing illogical people when in this generation we have a wealth of knowledge and information at our fingertips.	30
1	... it's a planet.	30
1	More like "Elle-phant."	30
1	The bigger problem will be the train she will most definitely derail.	30
1	Hot coffee just came out my nose. Worth it	30
1	Honestly, I see a lot of shitlords do that too. Shitlords, don't add the extra donut. We know better. loose =/= lose.	30
1	i love how 95% of the crowd understands that this is a joke, then there's the 5% that looks like a fucking tool	30
1	YOU'RE FUCKING OBESE BITCH!!!!!!ARAGHAHAGAGA	30
1	I'll never understand the fupakini parade.  All women I know who are what true average should be - skinnyfats, are super self conscious in swimwear.  Fat fucks should wear burqas or stop leaving the house.	30
1	Love how she photoshopped the fat out of the rib and arms section. "Nope no fat here, just mah curves."	30
1	TIL having standards is rape	30
1	I feel bad for the 1980's couch that became her blouse	30
1	Pointing out the obvious is TRIGGERING me! OMG you can't just *notice* negative attributes that I publicly post!  ^^^/^^^s	30
1	My brain cannot reconcile an apparently happy facial expression with legs like that.  WTF have you got to smile about?  Your tree trunk legs are visiting their relatives?	30
1	And yet I guarantee she'd cry real buttery tears if anyone told her she was obese. They always seem to think 'obese' is reserved for bed bound lardbags.	30
1	As a fairly young doctor, it is always startling to me when I meet patients who are younger than me, on meds for high blood pressure and cholesterol, and just like "yep, whatever, everyone in my family is on this shit."  Dude, you're fucking 30 and you are on a med you will be on for the rest of your life, and you're fine with that?  Fuck that.	30
1	Not a terribly surprising path for these people. They don't believe in calories in / calories out, so why not order wacko pills from India?	30
1	I think all doctors are shitlords, right?	30
1	I'm 6'2''.  You don't need to see them, hot air rises, and with it carries the skank of their sweating crevices, cheesy feet crammed into 'cute' ballet shoes, unchanged support bandages, poorly cleaned genitals, greasy faces and hot breath tainted by its last processed filth snack.  I never get cold due to my circulation not being clogged with lard, I enjoy cracking a window open on public transport / public spaces when it's cold outside. They know the reason you've done it is to release their fumes and can't say anything without identifying the problem of their beef musk.	30
1	The Northern Bariactric Surgery Institute, apparently.  www.cutweight.org	30
1	Yep,  The clue is the earth shaking and temperature dropping a few degrees as the sun is blocked out. In some cases birds become confused and begin to roost.	30
1	Ronald McDonald x Wendy  and a side of beetus	30
1	These stupid fat fuck Tubblr "activist" imbeciles are becoming impossible to parody. What in the fuck is a gender buffet? This shit is getting worse than corporate buzzwords with all the made-up moronic horsecock language these beetusblobs spew out of their overstuffed fucking mouths.  Theoretically, if I had a movement, I'd kick these kinds of fucks right the hell out of it, because they make it impossible for any sane person to take them seriously.	30
1	Oliver? Shit yes, considered this signed. His program that launched in L.A. some years ago was damn educational. I just hope that education sticks with the kids and prevents the sticking of adipose. [Done signing]. Thanks for this.	30
1	Sounds exactly like what inspired my username	30
1	I can smell your nerd cred, and it thrills me.	30
1	Meninism is actually a satirical Twitter account that parodies tumblr feminism.   Not a real movement.  Though I'm sure some particularly stupid people do take it seriously but whaddya expect I mean tumblr took freebleeding seriously. There's always going to be that one extra stupid person.	30
1	Victim complexes. Lack of self awareness. Distaste for personal responsibility. Massive sense of entitlement.   Some combination of all 4, idk.	30
1	It's genitals have probably rotted away in fecal bacteria a long time ago.	30
1	Awful haircut? Check.  Terrible dye job? Yep.  Ugly tattoo? Check.  A bunch of shit in her face? You got it.  Fat as a hippo? Ding!  What we have here, folks, is the *Tumblerinicus Astronomico*. Shown in her natural habitat, her eye coverings are used to mask the utter shame and disgust she has in herself as she watches the more sexually active and attractive distant relatives of the species.	30
1	Dat cheeto dust complexion doe	30
1	We're going to need both.	30
1	Sweet merciful mother of Christ she was hot. I don't want to live on this planet anymore.	30
1	That's a pretty solid argument against taking public transportation. Okay, not solid, more like runny, but still, you get the point. There is nothing really stopping the general public from fouling the seats. Fucking gross.	30
1	Yik yak is garbage.  They censor everything I post.  Boo, death to yik yak.	30
1	The mere fact that we have to think a minute before declaring "fake" is disgusting.  This becomes more believable every day.	30
1	Watching him flail around on the ground that like was a spectacularly beautiful, pathetic sight to behold.  Running over his fat-rascal was a nice touch.	30
1	She is just wearing tight jeans .Trust me I have enough experience staring at different kind of hotties.	30
1	RASCAL TIPPING!!!! WREEEEE WREEEEE WREEEEE	30
1	Schrodingers fat: it only has calories once you look at the nutritional facts.	30
1	Yup. She was. I used to adore her. Now... I kinda detest her for not having more self control.	30
1	We should start calling these 'Fit to Shit'	30
1	&gt;None of us are waiting around at the squat rack to talk to the dude with the perfect arms  It's like they don't know what happens in the squat rack	30
1	I started out thinking the guy was just being PC for TV purposes but then he went full retard.  Outside of taking up other customers' spaces, fat people are a safety hazard.  That guy in the picture is so goddamn fat the drink cart couldn't even get through.  But sure, let's let him pay for one seat because we should all be nice to each other.	30
1	It's hard to believe this,  we've come to expect so much more from Portugal and/or Brazil. The magazine cover is ugly., just fucking ugly.	30
1	For those wondering, her bmi using the listed info is 19.1, or normal. She's not underweight, I think the pants she's wearing are making her look much skinnier.	30
1	I'm 6'1" I think the view is just as uninspiring from any angle.	30
1	I also hate that people think diet coke is some evil concoction of toxic chemicals... aspartame is the only thing that COULD have harmful effects in theory, plus a company the size of cocacola isnt going to put out any products that they think is even slightly dangerous. Think of the lawsuits!	30
1	Yea I agree. Telling people to go kill themselves is taking shit a bit too far.  More than likely fat will do that to the "things" we shitlord about but shit, their fat can wish death upon them. We shouldnt be doing that. We are better than fat.	30
1	They make dramatic over-generalizations because for them, there is no such thing as compromise. There is no finding a "happy medium." They are self-centered, over-indulgent and have no inkling of self control / willpower / moderation.  For them, to give up even some of their comfort (whether that be comfort on the couch as opposed to a treadmill, or comfort-food compared to healthy alternatives) is to give up EVERYTHING. Hence, their decisions are only black &amp; white.	30
1	Why on earth do so many fat people have a wide array of sporting accessories? It seems like there's a fat person discount for them because I swear, on a normal public transport day every overweight person has a Nike, Adidas, Underarmour, Puma, whatever bag or leggings, shorts or shirts.    I need a decent midsized bag for school and sport gear. I never thought I'd say this but I'm envious of a fat persons budget. -_-   OP, I'm the same height but rockin an extra 15lbs on you, you look fabulous. Keep that up!	30
1	http://imgur.com/WdBB6ys  Her profile for the curious.	30
1	What are those tattoos on her boobs supposed to be? Seagulls? Tiger stripes? Stretch marks?	30
1	Guinea pigs are relatively neat.  Even when exploring new sections of the house, ours would always create neat little piles, returning to them when they needed to.  Occasionally they'd forget where their old pile was and start a new one, but it was always organized.	30
1	As far as I can tell they are seagulls who are there to catch her crumbs that she inevitably drops on them	30
1	Sub is 18+  Benned.	30
1	At least the hippo wiped.	30
1	It can't be healthy for my brain to go from something so viscerally disgusting to something so sexy and beautiful.  Oh well, I'll let you all know if I develop a Pavlovian hatred of hot Korean women wearing leather.	30
1	That's not real plus size font. It needs to be *curvier* and AT LEAST FONT SIZE 20	30
1	You had me at "fuck you fatties".  Shitlord group hug. now.	30
1	Has to blow all that smoke to cover her blubber up.	30
1	now she has to guilt someone into cleaning up that mess, because she sure as shit isn't going to do it.	30
1	Couldn't make it past the first few images, just a gross trashy fat woman. Quintessential tumblrina.	30
1	Either the obeast deleted the comment or op is a fucking liar because it's gone  Edit: [never mind I think op angered it](http://imgur.com/dvCnwg6)	30
1	I wouldn't be surprised if she just said that in hopes she'd be proved wrong	30
1	Nah, she'll probably just end up eating it off the floor.	30
1	true.  a loaf of garlic bread will probably mop up that mess nicely.	30
1	&gt;the prescription for gym is a literal prescription that gives me access to the VA gym and recreational facilities for health  Fatties get a prescription to join a gym at (what I suspect is) a reduced price?!  I've never been jealous of a fat person before. How do I get my cheap gym pass?!	30
1	Hahaha, 117 lbs at 5'5" is size 14? Give me a break! My good friend is 5'5" and 115, she wears a 2 or 4.	30
1	I'm not sure, but I know every time I call someone a cunt, my post disappears.	30
1	I genuinely don't believe its 27, no way	30
1	Better not tell this guy about the shitlords gone wild sub	30
1	He goes into starvation mode and his good genes just place the fat directly on to of his abs, making them looking bigger.	30
1	If you're gonna lie, at least make it believable	30
1	Big Mac flavored e-cig juice I bet	30
1	Hepatitis C? Causes skin and eyes to turn yellowish.	30
1	You know, we ought to taxonomize fats.	30
1	And I guess she blocked me. Can't find her	30
1	They love complaining about white guys until said guy pays attention to them.	30
1	face fat as fuck  teeth yellow as corn  it would take a semi truck  to haul this nasty whore	30
1	Excellent question, but no. I'm pretty furry irl.  *insert wookie noise here*	30
1	you must be new.	30
1	Oh look, that classy, timeless, Oompa Loompa orange fucking skin cancer tan with hair that's had the absolute shit bleached out of it on a corpse that looks like a scoop of mashed potatoes was dressed up in sequins they attached with a staple gun.	30
1	Of course, vaping is the hot new thing, so naturally the hams migrate towards it in a blind attempt at fitting in with the cool kids.	30
1	No less than 10 min after my comment I already found something even worse. Haha.	30
1	Normally your area has shitty people who get too overcome with feelings and downvote. If you hit -5 your post is deleted no matter what.	30
1	I bought it at first but yeah by the last line it's a troll	30
1	I don't think there is any FPH terminology for those. Former hams are just called former hams, and hams who are losing weight are still called hams because we don't care until they lose all the excess fat.	30
1	Wasn't that the whole 99% movement kinda? Everybody got maced and there were riots and shit and I don't remember any RAEI hashtags.  &gt;Edit: a letter	30
1	Doesn't take long right?	30
1	Embrace your natural fatty repellant privilege.	30
1	I'm 6'4" and believe me. It's just as ugly from my point of view. I don't think it realises that we may notice it filling 100% of our visual field from a mile away.	30
1	Inspired by the fact I saw a chubster today at the gym in a tank top with the word sweat written across it. She didn't fucking sweat a drop, I ran for 40 minutes and in that time I saw her come in, follow her boyfriend around, struggle a couple laps around the 1/10 mi track, and lose the ability to suck  in her fucking gut with all that exertion.   All I wanted to do was slap her with a piece of cheese. Fat shit, the smoothie bar is at the door. Exit at the fucking gift shop.	30
1	The surface areas are cold, and surrounded by a smelly methane and sulfuric atmosphere. Inside the liquid lard core is very warm, and quickly gets overheated on typical sunny days.	30
1	Try using their gravitational pull to whip yourself around them and reach escape velocity. I think I saw that in a movie.	30
1	If I google "Salma Hayek, Jennifer Love Hewitt, and Halle Berry" I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be going to sleep soon.	30
1	Why would you do this to your child	30
1	This happens ALL THE TIME to me on IG	30
1	actually yes. once a dog starts shitting all over the place it's done for	30
1	Seriously. Mirin ab physique.	30
1	6'5" here, the birds eye view just makes them look even more round.	30
0	he might just be trying to get her close to home...	30
0	Don't you see guys?? She learnt that angles show off her chins more! More to love right?	30
0	All of those years and not a single minute of exercise.	30
0	Why? Why would do this to us?	30
0	Facts don't reals, only feels.	30
0	I know the term "bridge troll" is thrown around a lot these days, but fuck is that the mug of a mutant that lives under a crevice and steals coins from children under threat of being eaten or what?	30
0	whats up with the cigarrete hate?	30
0	She can eat more but her metabolism is higher during puberty.	30
0	nah [s]he's a [prancercisor](https://youtu.be/o-50GjySwew)	30
0	She looks like she's trying to hide her hunger for eating a baby.	30
0	This was his only chance with a woman until he hits puberty and fills out into a man.	30
0	Why did you share that pain with us!?	30
0	She's still a cunt.	30
0	I've been eclipsed before so that's a very real possibility	30
0	Eh,  you can say that about anyone with any kind of addiction though,  gambling,  smoking,  drugs,  etc... Its not unique to fat people  Your post reminded me of quitting smoking I just had to comment	30
0	Wearing a trench coat; check.  Neckbeard; check.  Talks about "chivalry"; check.  All that's missing is the fedora and whining that, "nice guys always get stuck in 'the friend zone'."	30
0	i dont remember starbucks being that good? dunno	30
0	A lot of people say there are Irish to sound cooler and get Irish stuff but there aren't Irish it's annyoing	30
0	Cheese is like, THE WORST thing.	30
0	Looks more like two shes like one of each. Could be one of those stud dykes	30
0	He just must've been upset because he is stuck with a crack head looking wife.	30
0	She just always wanted to look like a fat Maisie Williams.	30
0	More like 'literally everything'.	30
0	I'm 17 and i said I was 37. Guess it's time to kill myself.	30
0	Some people still have self-respect.	30
0	They aren't obese imo, this is the size of a normal non fit American. Bmi at 26-27 with heavy bloating from shit tons of carbs and beer. And awful posture	30
0	I definitely will have a "fat clause" in my prenups.	30
0	Yup. And all because "men are masculine therefore strong, they can't be weak or victims, that's feminine and feminine is the worst thing a man can be!" Yeah, doesn't make it easy on guys any more than it does for girls. I don't get why anyone thinks anyone benefits as a whole from sexism... we may suffer in different ways be we all still suffer and acting like one or the other is the "bad guy" is exactly what I'd expect from fatlogic.	30
0	TIL:  I'm an (occasional) oil-driller.	30
0	So you aren't allowed to try? That is partially the mentality the fat people have. It never said anything about her doing stupid shit, just that she was fat.	30
0	Never hard that before. That's disgusting. People are shit.	30
0	I too love posts from 6 years ago	30
0	That's the best thing I've read today.	30
0	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  They are not bulking. That first one on the left, *maybe*. The other 2? no.   Banned.	30
0	Your pedantic semantics aren't welcome here fatty.	30
0	Thank fuck not all feminists are the same, I always feel happy when I see a man or woman out there helping whoever needs it, not who has the same type of genitals.	30
0	1) this is FPH if you don't like people being assholes get out  2) percentages are just a different aspect to look at the vote. However, this list is ordered by majority. Adding one to each would never, ever, change the hierarchy of this list. Autist.	30
0	He looks like a douche and that bitch looks like a rough trick that been around a hell of a lot.	30
0	I was just on the elliptical this afternoon. Burned 600 calories at a normal running pace at low resistance in just an hour.   They're not even trying. It's pathetic.	30
0	No fucking shit they last longer. They have to make up for their sorry excuse of a body somehow. This is just like how fat chicks always give great head. They have o make up for the fact that they're fucking fat and being good at something sexual is the best way to go about it	30
0	Prove it fatty. Get verified	30
0	Same. It's like all the fat stayed in his head the whole time.	30
0	You're prob more look like Les Schwab the tire guy	30
0	Ugh, that's a visual I can't stop seeing	30
0	I'm 18 and I get 20-22, I'd get verified to prove I'm not fat but I'm not active enough yet.	30
0	You guys do realize it's something called a role?	30
0	At least she's trying. I think so.	30
0	So, the person who complains about shitposts becomes a shitposter in this sub. Sound logic there fella, sound logic!	30
0	I use the elliptical for warm up. But my main cardio is cycling.	30
0	Have you ever thought that perhaps your aunt's preference in black men may be the cause, and not other races' lack of attraction? This is surface level racism and confirmation bias lol  I'm aware this is a joke, and it is funny, but let's not pretend we're all idiots and it's not a racist joke (which there is not much wrong with as long as you can recognize it *is* racism and that's why it's a funny taboo joke)	30
0	&gt;If you came here to hate on fats why does it matter what somebody calls themselves?!  Precisely the point I am making.  You can't ban me you softcock. I bet you are fat in real life. You really responded to this like a HAES supporter.	30
0	Fat bastard ate a bagel with a pound of cream cheese and a large frapuccino with hot fudge on the bottom. The straw was a fucking cookie! After he ate and drank all that he pulled out some candy and proceeded to stuff his fat face even further.	30
0	Because there is no reason to announce that you are a woman on a board where it is totally irrelevant. It is bottom of the barrel attention seeking. I don't have flair? What a load of wank. Shit is next level imaginary internet point whoring.	30
0	She's thanking god for puberty because now she'll be able to eat twice as much and twice as hard. she is universe.	30
0	Yep. Weight loss is honestly 100% diet. Exercise is a side piece that isn't required whatsoever. I got to 102 without lifting a fucking leg, really... that's underweight for my height. All by just not eating as much shit.  It's 80/20 if you want it to be, but it can be 100% diet.	30
0	When a manatee tries to be human	30
0	That poor expensive car.	30
0	Maybe she hasnt gone through puberty yet and is hoping things will just magically get better??	30
0	Shes graduating in both of them! I swear she just changed gown colors and took a pic.	30
0	&gt;evading bans is generally frowned on by reddit admins  lol, I should give a fuck why? This site is the literally ground zero for internet circlejerking. I bet most of the men on here spank it to MLP and the women are so pent up they get anal fissures everytime someone mentions they don't give a fuck that they are a woman.	30
0	I meant 80/20 diet/exercise there, of course.	30
0	A beautiful beard is blossoming! How special for it!	30
0	Freud would be proud of these "dad bod" idiots, Oedipus complex to the max!	30
0	I think she owns stock in Spanx and Adobe.	30
0	I don't know what bulletproof coffee is but from what I remember, coffee contains zero energy. It's the sugar, milk and syrups that make it unhealthy.	30
0	Fuck off with the sympathy.  Banned.	30
0	He's an asshole anyway haha	30
0	Because for some reason you think I won't be posting here. It takes three clicks to create a new account. It is literally easier to make a new account than ban someone lol. Toodles!	30
0	I didn't get there until high school.	30
0	The Hep-C keeps them thin.	30
0	This is gaining weight for a role. It is called acting.	30
0	what about [shitmayos](http://imgur.com/RsG9UHN) you cisscum?  &gt;we tumblr now	30
0	I use myfitnesspal ap to track my calories. Idk what it would recommend for you but it has been working for.me and my wife....	30
0	Snoop isn't joining this sub's cause. He's most likely never seen it. I know you want to feel special, like not thinking being fat is great is some reddit secret club and Snoop's joined you. Fucktard	30
0	Came here to ask that. :(	30
0	What's the site?	30
0	I like both of those things.  If you procrastinate your craft you are not an artist. I don't even get that title, and I spent well over a year drawing 8 hours a day every single day.  There again, it's obvious this ham is procrastinating. If it wasn't, then it wouldn't be so damn fat. Too busy with a tablet in the lap.	30
0	Shit like this makes me think I should set up my wife's twitch TV because she's got some double fucking D's on her 5'1 slim waisted frame thT we could capitalize on. I was talking with my buddy last time I took him to the gym with me and he said something like "oh yeah I'm in shape, I have abs."  I said "yeah no shit you have abs, abs on a skinny guy is like abs on a fat girl. It just comes with the territory."	30
0	If he loses it again it will be a win for us though as we can use him as an example of how anyone can lose weight  We can use it to shitlord more efficiently	30

0	Not at all. Trp uses biology as the basis for a mating strategy. One of the big factors is to get in ahape.	30
0	Sometimes people say "never mind" because they realize that what they just said is dumb or pointless. They may have realized it halfway through saying it and stopped themselves, which caused you to not understand them in the first place.

0	Feminist checking in. People like the waste of space in the picture are not feminists. That have corrupted the meaning of the word, just as the person above mentioned their co-opting of "cute" and "curvy". A feminist believes men and women are equal, not that men should be demonized to boost up women. There are a lot of us who believe in equality for all genders, not denigrating one to serve another. These SJW hams just bellow the loudest and most frequently. And frankly, they HURT the very cause they claim to be supporting. It's disgusting.  Edit - deleted an unnecessary word	30
0	That is a rare pepe	30
0	So the ruptured fat cells, and their content, is released into the body. I'm pretty sure that unhealthy and already severely over taxed organs of obeasts are going to get toxic from this. Especially since the easy way out is off label use, and moar injections all over. Coupled with extreme amounts of fat, they r gonna just up and die.  Body cannot absorb that much melted fat that fast. Unhealthy bodies even less ability.	30

0	Fat sympathy my ass. You're an idiot and so is the dumb fuck that deleted my post. Seems like reading comprehension isn't a strong suit around here. Give it a few more years and maybe you'll learn how to think. Maybe.	30
0	Didn't anyone teach him to keep things within believable constraints when lying.	30
0	Correct.  That would be over at /r/ incest. (Yeah I broke the link on purpose, we all know what's there.)	30
0	You think I care if I get banned from a subreddit? The fucking horror!	30
0	You should read the edited version of my post.	30

0	What's wrong with planet fitness?	30

0	I'd probably let her give me some head.	30
0	That was one of the more disgusting things I have seen in my life. I think the angle makes it worse	30
0	What is that really? You obviously can't tell health by a blood sample.	30
0	Considering I've been bodybuilding for two years it's pretty impressive.	30
0	They should install chicanes on staff entry doors in hospitals so you can only enter to work if your human sized	30
0	Not to be an ass but in cases of abuse the one person who doesnt need any power has control :/  Both sides involve selfish assholes, unfortunately one side severely damages another human being that isn't them.	30
0	&gt; which people are you referring to when you say "starving themselves"?  I'm too lazy to read all that copy pasted stuff but I was talking about normal people and the people who tend to yo-yo in weight. And when I say starving I mean the people who try to eat 500 calories a day then go back their normal lifestyle once they seen the pounds fall off.	30
0	Do you have pics of yourself? Most girls I see when running at the park are pretty thin and attractive, but sometimes I see girls that look like they're 1% body fat, all muscle and look fucking disgusting. I just want to say that there is a such thing as too much exercise and not enough eating. Abs on women don't look particularly sexy to me	30
0	Their blood has literally turned to butter and chocolate...	30
0	stopped reading at "femanon"	30
0	this is obviously a made up story though, lol.	30
0	She's only over weight... What the fuck guys. We want to see some planets. Not a size 16 chick.   Edit: Seriously? Banned for asking pics of fatter people? WHAT THE FUCK?	30
0	Aaaaaaand I just threw up in my mouth. God that is disgusting.	30
0	I wonder what else would fit in the cups of that bra (if it can still be called that)...bowling ball? Watermelon? A newborn baby?	30
0	I don't really hate fat people at all, I just saw this while browsing through r/all and I thought to myself "who the fuck films themselves themselves doing this kind of shit?"	30
0	I'm not so keen on it, so I try to eat mostly mono and poly fats, as well as enough oils and fats from salmon and flounder fish. Love me some chicken breasts too, and my favorite is spicy cilantro chicken sausage :) Also, herb crusted tofu.... But I'm getting carried away here :)	30
0	Quit being a fatty sympathizer.	30
0	He's kind of fat, too...  Just saying.	30
0	I did the same exact thing like 4 days ago when I found this sub. There are so many posts that literally piss me off because they're not only fat as fuck but they're stupid as hell as well. Being fat and stupid as fuck should be illegal	30
0	You RMR changes depending on your weight to...  And they also don't seem to take TDEE into account either...	30
0	Hambeast? I was thinking of sending blue mountain chiropractic a polite message when I saw the term "shitlady" being used.	30
0	This honestly makes me mad. She could be so attractive but her fat just ruins it all.	30
0	I like when he's playing the guitar in strange wilderness singing about his new stepmother and step siblings. Haha "gentle clowns of Nazareth".	30
0	Well that would make sense since she claims to be a size 24, but we suspect her to be much bigger.	30
0	Really? I mean, I pretty much put an asterisk next to a personal anecdote so I don't get wtf you are getting on about.   Maybe I did it the wrong way, if so, there were nicer ways to say so.	30
0	&gt;reek of ass and fold mould  Holy shit, I laughed so hard that I have watery eyes.	30
0	how is it gross? apparently im in smokers hate not fatpeople hate...	30
0	I think that's a dude...	30
0	I'd say it the type of popular movie roles for him would fluctuate	30
0	Could have been liberty!	30
0	It's really not. You're BARELY in the 1k club, and that's literally the minimum requirement to consider yourself a lifter. Otherwise, you just go to the gym.	30
0	One on the right has the body condition known as fucking hot but skelator there on the left is to lazy to eat anything looking like Ethiopia Barbie.  Edit  respect? you poor fool i eat beef jerky, not try to fuck it. that bone purse with a pulse, shriveled up, dried raisin, deflated beach ball looking walking corpse, it looks like you crammed 10 pounds of chicken bones in a balloon.	30
0	she had more in snacks than I was able to keep down all day yesterday :'^)	30
0	Heh, doing research on "invasive species" I see	30
0	Enjoy your shortened life span, seaham.	30
0	I guess when they  have their Eat-A-Thons their brains release endorphins. Therefore they consume and are happy. Food is a drug to them they can never get enough. Im pretty sure you ask a fatty about what foods are their favorite they will go into a high detailed description.	30
0	I've been going to a gym for 4-5 days a week for 18 years straight. Sit down and shut the fuck up, little man.	30
0	I thought starvation mode was if you eat only one large meal a day which leads to your body storing more as fat in perpetration for not eating. My dad told me that anyway when we were doing construction and spending a lot of the day without having eaten only to eat huge dinners when we were done	30
0	That's the thing he's so famous now he'd still be able to fuck something. So that whole sex incentive is lost on him which could be bad.	30
0	I still can't see anything with him or Michael Cera after seeing Superbad. I think only Last Airbender and Avatar have made me as angry as that movie has for how bad it is	30
0	Its not shaped for 2 people to sit on. If 2 people sit there they will lean into each other	30
0	Like I said she can do what she wants but having actively trained muscles is objectively better than not having any.	30
0	He's playing a character it wouldn't be the first time an actor gained or lost weight to fit a role.  I read that some speculate it may be a fat suit.	30
0	Google could give you a better answer but basically RMR is how many calories you need to consume a day to stay the same weight if you sat on your ass all day... For someone my weight its around 1200-1400 an obeast roughly 1800-2000 . TDEE is total daily energy expenditure... So base plus whatever exercise you do. There are loads of online calculators to work out how many cals you should roughly consume in a day but my got to is myfitnesspal because you can log everything you eat and your exercise for the day... It then gives your calorie "balance"	30
0	And yet I've been absolutely slammed for my 17.5 BMI by fats, where suddenly, it absolutely means something, amirite? And, for that matter, here. Please, though. I can't wait to see your reaction to my BMI.  BMI works for the general population, your friend is an outlier.	30

0	while your at it (googling) check out the calories in a Starbucks coffee.... While we all know hamplanets lie when they say they barely eat anything, it's amazing and sickening/frightening how many calories you can consume in a day through liquids. Alcohol is another really good way to quickly clock up empty calories... Dancing them off is fun and easy for us normal people tho lol	30
0	Wrong sub for that.	30
0	&gt;These guys aren't fat  Banned.	30
0	Daaamn. That's an awful thought.	30
0	As a non American I've heard of half and half in books etc but you prompted me to google exactly what it is. I was expecting a 2% milk type thing or powdered milk with some sugar...   As a long time member of FPH its almost amusing that I can still be shocked at the shit (that a lot of) Americans consume with total disregard to calories and health effects...	30
0	Came here to say those poor bunnies look like they'll be scarred for life	30
0	Unless they gain weight or lose hair or go grey, men pretty much stop ageing after 27 up until early 50s. There's a lot of dad-bodies walking around with 20-something faces.	30
0	you mean an iPhone selfie with filters and eye-angle and such? yeah nice try. Feed it your recent DMV photo and then we'll talk :)	30
0	Here is a fatty I can almost applaud. He is ashamed of his state of health, and is working to improve it. He invested a great deal of money into a new hobby to ensure he stays dedicated.  Now if only he wasn't fat.  EDIT: I need to work on my satire.	30
0	Grats, you found someone to stroke you for money... Just hire a whore ffs they'll tell you anything you want to hear and in a far sexier voice	30
0	And this is why I have to get my boots taken in by a cobbler after buying them. Fat people ruin everything	30
0	Nice job on calling out the fatty... But, he does have a point; why would you date a nignog?	30
0	So it needed an entire meme arrow to point out what was going to be obvious? "LOOK AT ME I AM A GIRL ON THE INTERNET *holds up spork* LOL". [Tampon dispensing knights](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03284/jose_3284632b.jpg) might relentlessly shill for you on reddit, but you know the reality.

0	Five days? That's 6,000 calories per day. Unless doing some serious, hardcore work that's a lot. That's close to two weeks worth of food for me (ymmv). Can't imagine not eating fruits and vegetables, either.	30
0	Is that *accurate* though? I don't see the problem with it I guess, if you actually spent those few extra calories.	30

0	u people never take into account the  genetic part of obesity , some people dont have a choice ...	30

0	"My bet is this is American" nice battle racism with reductive ignorant stereotypes! Not all Americans are racist, there are racists everywhere it's unfair to assume someone is American because they are racist. America has done a lot for equality and for African Americans, we feed them educate them and do all we can to help them succeed. Our general population would be disgusted by the coal burner comments. There is significantly less racism in America than in most other places in the world. I know it's cool to hate America because we are rich and powerful but honestly you just sound ignorant.	30

0	Every time I think I've seen it all they find a new way to look more fucked up.	30
0	That makes no sense. It's a healthy fat, look up the new studies. It's crucial in the production of certain hormones, with a minimum required amount.   Do have to say though, that food all sounds too good!	30

0	OH look more shitlording subreddits, awesome!	30
0	No idea. I'm 102 and I still have softness I can't stand.	30
0	I run 3 miles in 27-30 minutes and it tells me I burn 566 calories. I've just read from googling around that this app over estimates your workout calories so I don't trust it.	30

0	If hating fat people is the name of the game, wouldn't you guys be happy that someone is working toward losing weight?  Before anyone says it; No she didn't lose a whole ton of weight. But it's at least noticeable, probably 20 pounds or so. And who even knows how long of a span that was, could be less than a month.  So that leads us to making fun of people for not losing weight fast enough?	30
0	The bitch on the right is totally cheating, even after her sister called her out. She literally can't not chew if something's near her face.	30
0	0/10 fire wasn't even lit. Seriously, what kind of pussy jumps over a pile of slightly smoking ashes?	30

0	Bulking is so stupid, why would you need a high fat percentage to gain muscle?	30
0	Jesus, it looks like he found the fountain of youth.	30
0	That's funny I use the same app and I just checked. Running for 27 minutes at 9min/mile pace is 307 calories. The only other variable here is weight. I weigh 140 so if you were heavier you would burn more calories running because it requires more energy to move that extra weight. I set my profile to sedentary and eat back all of my calories and am still dropping weight.	30
0	That's her beat-up vagina.	30
0	I'm not into the whole SJW "SHES BEAUTIFUL TOO" bullshit, but she's still a person. She's not an 'it'. I agree that weight gain to her size is intensely bad self upkeep, but I'm positive that you've fucked up a lot of things in your life. Namely your mindset is already messed up behind the idea of online anonymity.	30
0	I read it as satire. I laughed so hard at this sentence. &gt; Prize-winning dad bod.	30
0	Fuuuuuuuuuuck. I think I have the same mug that the forehead-fatty is guzzling lard out of. Think I might have to dispose of it now.	30
0	I find the argument ironic. So many of the models and athletes and actresses who these guys drool over would have abs and defined muscles if they took a photo of themselves in the right light.	30

0	I wonder why the one on the left didn't get silicon face implants, I guess people don't do that, it'd have to be something custom made / designed..  I know it's something fucked in her liver right, she doesn't produce fat cells.	30

0	My mom was big my whole life, but she taught me really good eating habits. I didn't have soda or candy until I was at least ten. She would cook comfort food, but try to make it as low calorie as possible. When I'd go back to school after going to the doctor or whatever, she would make me an avocado sandwich and I was just as happy. She might have been big but I'm grateful that she purposely made sure I had a chance at a healthy life. She's a great woman for that	30
0	You are actually so stupid that there is 0% chance you are not a burden on your family.	30
0	Bro, do you even lift?  Visible abs is not 15-18% bf.	30
0	you should be banned for displaying a fatty losing weight and then saying that it ruined her body.	30
0	Come on, that one was kinda funny.	30
0	This is how it plays out in their dim little minds    These people hate fatties, let me call them fat. It'll make them so upset and rustle their panties and I'll feel better about myself for being a lazy piece of crap. And they'll hate themselves for being fat.  I posted a pic to r/trees yesterday and fatties said my legs were fat, because they went through my post history and saw I browse this sub. I just don't understand what they think they're doing. Do they think they won?	30
0	She was chubby before but the muscle gain is genuinely unattractive. I guess I am alone in the belief that muscle is unattractive.	30
0	Who tf is that?	30
0	BMI is just mass/height, which doesn't consider shit like bf or even how much water you've drunk. Sub 10% is extremely difficult for women and my gf had to cycle an EC stack &lt;1000 calories a day to achieve it. Also I never said she was anorexic or unattractive.	30
0	Why do posts like this get thousands of notes, yet my post of myself in a bikini at 130 lb 5'10" get no notes at all! Tumblr makes no sense...	30

0	patriotism is just a fancy word for nationalism.	30

0	He wasn't hating.  Just saying two factual things	30
0	Nope. The only reason I'm doing the gym circuit is to get/maintain my six pack, but even with me wanting to get muscly, this is too much. Not gross as the fatties are claiming, just not my ideal.	30
0	The world is full of racists.	30
0	You certainly wouldn't call a fatty swimming naked skinny dipping would you? That might give them a bloated self-esteem lol	30

0	Hey now, those selfies aren't going to take themselves!	30
0	Agreed.  I'm the same as you (height/weight) and I thought I looked gross at 127. Even at 107 I still had some chub I could lose. 166 pounds seems giant to me.	30
0	Jesus was a historical figure, we have as much archeological information relating to him as we do for many other ancient figures whom few people would question were real. The only debate when it comes to Jesus is whether or not the claims he made were true, not whether or not he existed.	30
0	The bacon friend looks fat too. She's got fat girl cleavage going on.	30
0	She isn't that low body fat, fairly low yes. She has lucky fat distribution were abs are visible at a higher procentage ( I do to). And take a look at someone like Michelle lewin, she is quite ripped but still not close to being a bodybuilder	30
0	Of course they're angling themselves for the picture, unlike the Protein World model who just faced forward toward the camera.	30
0	Wouldn't be surprised if that's what he made his with. He made edibles for clubs.   Guess who never got to try any cuz he was a friend of a friend just visiting from upstate and the ham cleaned him out :')	30
0	"Just to be a normal human being" But you'll still never be a real woman. You disgusting trannies are almost as bad as ham planets. Good job being the slightly less gross pile of shit.	30
0	Agreed!  I suppose a better way to phrase that would be "the modern idea of a divine Jesus is fake"	30
0	Doesn't look like she runs either	30
0	You are breakin rule 6, no being a little bitch. Don't sympathize with that stupid animal, it doesn't have feelings like we do.	30
0	aren't you that scrawny virgin?	30
0	She looked chubby in her before picture. Her BMI was probably already over 25. Her tummy was already bulging out in that one. She just got worse and worse.	30
0	I support people living a healthy lifestyle, and by the looks of this girls after picture it appears she's making an attempt to do that.	30

0	If we're being honest, black men usually have lower standards.	30
0	I have firewalked, in fact. This isn't firewalking, it's a woman trying to jump over a fire. I've also done that, but we actually lit the fire.  Yes, smouldering coals are hot, but that's not relevant here.	30
0	Not agreeing with the general sentiment of the comments on the pic and I may get downvoted but...  I don't find visible abs on a woman attractive. It comes off as very masculine and welp, I guess I prefer my women feminine.	30
0	It's sour grapes. Same as chubby girls who look at muscular guys with abs and say "ew that's gross". They know those guys will never be interested in them so they try to delude themselves into thinking they aren't attracted to them.   But deep down they know the truth. They know.	30

0	To be fair, it's not all the whales fault that the government wasted so many resources on this.  Why are 7 police cars needed? Why would even 1 be needed? I understand the additional manpower of emt's and firemen because they have medical training and they do extractions etc all the time. But cops? What are they going to shoot the door down to make lard extraction go easier? Read the first crane its rights?	30

0	That's so unfortunate. I've heard nothing but terrible things about Planet Fitness. I go to New York Sports Club since they started a $19.95 plan a few months ago and that's the same price as going to PF in my area. All I hear are they hate fit people and give out free people.

0	Hmm.. First time posting in fatpeoplehate. It's strange, I see comments on a lot of links where people are wishing people death and heart diseases. And here I am joking about punching he's chin and I get downvoted to oblivion. Gotta love reddit lol.	30
0	&gt; As a black guy I can sadly confirm this. The men of my race have 0 standards as long as they can get arse. I'm so proud my woman still keeps her abs.  The black guy above me confirms this. Fuck off, person who can't read. Unless you want to call a black man racist. But black people can't be racist, remember? Racism = power+prejudice or whatever bullshit it is nowadays. Checkmate, theists.	30

0	Man, if you're fat just accept it. I know that I am fat and haven't made the adjustments necessary to change that.  That's on me and no one else	30
0	Evidence-based medicine is a form of medicine that aims to optimize decision-making by emphasizing the use of evidence from well designed and conducted research. HAES is in no way, shape or form, evidence-based medicine. There is no well designed research demonstrating that obesity is safe and compatible with a healthy lifestyle.	30

0	To be fair, women with developed muscle could seem less attractive to some men. Personally I like it, but hey that's just how some guys feel.	30
0	And I'm totally fine with your preferences.  Women are meant to have higher a higher body fat percentage than men, or else their hormonal balance gets out of wack and suddenly, among other thing, their periods stop as their body is basically telling them that can't support creating life form (which is what distinguishes them from men).  P.S. I would like to say thanks to all the haters on my OP.	30

0	I was at a restaurant with some friends once, and they had those aluminum chairs are welded together, and one of them I guess had a bad weld in it, and after a minute or two of sitting on it, the weld gave, and the chair collapsed.  I'm a pretty big guy, shoulders are 52 inches around, my waist is about 36.  Even when the weld broke, I basically just fell down to the ground.  But this dude, he fucking shatters the chair. There's not even any structural damage to begin with!	30

0	It looks like 10-15lbs?  Hard to tell at that size.	30
0	Awesome, there is too much fat sympathy in this thread.	30
0	This brings up an interesting thing I've wondered.  Is the ability to put on muscle mass determined by genetics? All the males in my family seem to be muscular, even those who really don't put "effort" into it.	30
0	What the fuck is intuitive eating?	30
0	I dont know. Id have to see more of the potential fatty to confirm her fatness. I only see an angled face shot and some cleavage. OP was she really big in other pics too?	30

0	Eh confidence in looks isn't really what I meant.  I judge a lot based on a girl's shoes.  Heels, she's dressed to impress, but they give the impression of being averted to labor.

0	Honestly, I prefer the before pic.  Edit: Got to love the people in this sub. Make a comment about how a non-zero amount of body fat can make someone look healthier/better and get downvoted because pea brains can't understand that there is such a thing as a healthy amount of body fat. Stop being a bunch of obsessive fucks who try to justify hatred of obesity with the ignorant hatred of a natural of a needed component to your body. The girl in the first pic had a healthy amount of body fat.	30

0	Personally, I find The Oatmeal to be hyperbolic click bait bullshit, but I genuinely think the author is a very smart and good person, and I'm glad he has such a pro fitness viewpoint. His webcomic just isn't my cup of tea (why is his "main character" a fatass?).   Seriously my knees might hurt a bit after a week of running, but it's not the same as the type of damage caused by overloading their weight limits. Humans are built to run.	30

0	Some highlights for tldr:   "relatively few people there expect or want their partners of either gender to be chiseled out of granite"   "murky middle between swole and slovenly"   "None of us are waiting around at the squat rack to talk to the dude with the perfect arms"(maybe they're there to talk to the dude with perfect legs??)   "dadbod guys are the kind of guys who can meet your friends"  (my favorite since as everyone knows fit men have never been know to be able to handle meeting new people)	30

0	I am all for calling out fatties but picking on the mentally ill seems a bit cheap.	30
0	Muh 'merica!  Muh Jesus! Muh troops!	30
0	Yeah that's a good point. Her idea seems to be that "chiseled" guys aren't as down to earth as dadbods but I'm guessing that it's just because like you said dadbods are going to be nicer to fat girls.	30
0	This sub-reddit's gone from funny to self-righteous real fucking fast.	30
0	Is she actually the person writing this? If so is she being serious?	30
0	She is obviously capable of moving. I am not disagreeing with you but do you know she is on drugs? I have known a few people go on benders and they don't act like that.	30
0	That would explain a lot	30
0	That's why I said 10-15, because its so Barely noticeable.	30
0	I can genuinely say I think the first picture is more attractive.  I'm not saying it's healthier and I'm certainly not saying my view is the right one.  I'm saying the first picture isn't really *unhealthy* and some guys do like a *little* bit of chub.  Obviously she isn't anorexic.	30
0	I have seen A lot of Russian videos saying bath salt rampage, where they are mentally ill, just seems to be a thing where they say it to get more hits.	30
0	I live in the most southern part of the US and I don't understand how people say Wal-Mart is full of fats. If anything, Wal-Mart has some of the finest girls I'd see in a day. Target has more of the fatties, but significantly less. Hell, there's barely any fat people here and the ones that are fat are mostly old people who lived a normal life then gave up when they got old.	30
0	I am not arguing with you, but would the video uploader know her medical history and whether this is drugs or other mental problems?	30
0	Honestly, I don't think anything is lost when people are too stupid to realize eating too much makes you fat. Education is irrelevant to this point. It's like parents blaming school systems for their child's inability to read.   If obesity makes them die faster, let them eat cake.	30

0	And remember everyone if you click on this link and then vote on stuff be prepared to be shadowbanned.	30

0	We *are* better than fat.   ...hence, we should desire their self-directed deaths.  It's suicide either way. I just want them out of my line of sight/smell.	30

0	Omg I know this sounds like suicide...but I want to go so I can take so many pictures and upload them into FPH so we can all have a good laugh at the pathetic whales	30
0	&gt;In all honesty OP you do look underweight.  Even if she is, *who cares*. This point should have never been brought up. This is FatPeopleHate.	30
0	If you go there from FPH and vote on things you risk getting banned by admins. They see people coming from here and voting on stuff in a different subreddit.   If you think admins are going to give fph users benefit of the doubt you're crazy. The friends of fph in the sidebar are things the mods put there. They have no say in shadowbans.	30
0	Please don't let such behavior spread in fph. I'm here to read hate on lards. Not ~~under~~backhanded "eat a sammich" posts.	30
0	Yeah I live on the west side and a lot of the people around here are fatties. I hear Texas is on a different level of fatness though.	30
0	Hey, another ent that's also on FPH. Recognize. :P Broette, I wouldn't even worry. Trees has a nasty habit of anytime a female figure is in a picture with weed, they assume it's only upvoted because of grill.  Hot girls and weed will particularly pisses off the fat ents and lonely stoners. Which is fucking nuts, who doesn't enjoy looking at a sexy lady and a nice bowl of trees?  Personally, your legs look smooth and pristine as fuck. My takeaway was the using the passenger set and dash board as a way to lay back and smoke up.	30
0	my experience with them has been great. Believe it or not, fit people do workout there.   [Example](https://igcdn-photos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t51.2885-15/11018367_1561180470803961_1755507164_n.jpg) 1  [Example](https://igcdn-photos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/t51.2885-15/10956038_1579416508963220_1354734202_n.jpg) 2  The anti-pf thing is pretty much a circle-jerk.	30

0	It's far too big to fit over a tank.....	30
0	As a Military cop, I fucking hate that these fat pieces if shit get hired for these jobs, or any public service or protection jobs.  How it the holy hell is this a deterrent, and who the fuck is it going to protect the populace from?  Sunlight?	30
0	Um. why? *Edit, I see now.  Carry on.	30
0	I hate the people who vape and need to make sure you know they vape. We can still see your double chin fat fuck.	30

0	BMI is used very often but it's so inaccurate especially for someone like me with a great deal of muscle. I'm not trying to defend fatasses. I just needed to point that out.	30
0	So you messaged that for the pure joy of harassing another person?	30
0	Close enough for me.	30
0	When your standards for food are so low you'll eat Mexican food outside of Texas.	30
0	I find it weird when people, or hams, advertise 420 friendly on dating profiles or social media (I know it's not tobacco but similar concept, I suppose). It feels like if you need to advertise that you smoke weed after you've graduated from middle school, you can't be that interesting of a person to begin with. Maybe having family who smokes and stoner friends gives me a negative outlook on it all.  Note: Not a bash marijuana thing, I just don't like stoners.   Edit: Didn't realize the stoner crowd is strong in FPH. Kind of sad and just as pathetic as the fatties.	30
0	That reminds me of a fatty that had a crush on me in highschool and wouldn't leave me alone.  It had a huge nosering and ever since then I've associated noserings with fat smelly women that snort when they laugh.	30
0	I'm guessing that most of you on this sub are young and male. I'm not defending anyone who is gluttonous but I just want to remind you that your bodies are going to change over the years and you may one day end up being fat. I think it's inappropriate to refer to a fat person as an 'it'. Don't PM me with your hate. I'm just sayin'.	30
0	you look like you have anorexia? It's interesting you feel the need to make fun of someone else who also has an eating disorder. If anything she looks healthier than you.	30
0	I'm being totally honest, if I saw both of you standing next to each other I'd be like, dam, skeletor needs to eat some fucking food asap. Or at least stop throwing up what she does manage to eat.  Seriously.   That chick you posted isn't even that fat, I find her more attractive than you anyway, in terms of sexual attraction. At least it would feel like having sex with someone, rather than a corpse like skin bag of bones.	30
0	The only reason she was surprised about your blood tests is because normally skeletons don't have blood at all.   EDIT: Hey look, even skeletons need love right? [Is this what you listen to when you have sex?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-ZGAGcJrk)	30
0	I hate fat people just as much as the next shitlord, but this went a bit too far.	30
0	Shout out to all my new fans!	30
0	I thought the jokes were pretty funny myself. But I'm dead serious. You look like you need help, and the fact you try and make yourself feel better by 'humiliating' other people about their weight is just as concerning as your physique. You realize it works both ways right? Like super fat people are just as unattractive as super abnormally skinny people.. right? There's a good saying about people in glass houses not throwing stones..	30
0	The ghosts of all the food that has been lost to her stomach.	30
0	How did he not instigate that? Look, she's a hammy but in that instance, I simply wouldn't reply. If she feels like shit maybe she'll lose weight, but that was especially shitty what he said.	30
0	Hamsteroid and once ham has completed the conversion they become hambones.	30
0	This can't even just be normal fatty. This has to be a suoerhero or something.	30
0	I spent 12+ hours a day on the computer because my job requires it. I've been losing weight without any issues for a few weeks.   Hams just like to ignore nutrition labels, eat at every opportunity and then pretend it's not their fault.	30
0	Id put it in still backwards	30
0	You sound like you've got some serious problems to work out. I hope you can one day get a place in your life where you don't have to measure yourself against strangers in the street. Laters.	30
0	Hams love lying to themselves, good find!	30
0	This is disgusting on all accounts. If you have a cat that stays outside you run the risk of this happening albeit not intentionally. I feel sorry for the owner of the cat but if you have a freaking bengal cat...keep it inside. Or any cat for that matter.	30
0	This is why I wished they didn't ban guns in my country	30
0	Why? Were you going to hunt her down and shoot her dead, hard lad?	30
0	2/3 of those are negative.   I think you're right. Maybe it IS the majority.	30
0	Isn't grindr for gays? Wow so he's a faggot and he's fat. Either or would make me want to kill myself.	30
0	Genetics also raised her to have self respect, dignity, taught her about the importance of nutrition and balance. Gave her the tools to succeed and thrive. Genetics have a name, parents.	30
0	This doesn't feel like an actual conversation that's taking place for some reason.	30

0	Literally even the holocaust wasn't as bad as her "legs"	30
0	The bullshit around suicide is so weird...	30
0	The answer to this is yes. Fat=bad. Thin=good	30
0	Yeah, I get what you're saying but cats are still at risk of being prey. Stray dogs and what have you. Bengals are also quite expensive, if you're gonna spend that much on a purebred cat you should probably protect the investment.	30
0	I see the down vote fairies are out.	30
0	God, the fucking word "Rape" has turned into such a loose thing. Its like that episode of South Park with the M word.	30
0	There are different levels of hatred just as Dante described different levels of hell. The deeper hatred is saved for the worst of the worst.   But don't tales that as sympathy. Just because i hate the feeders and full on HAES FUPA troopers worse, doesn't mean that i love fats who burned off 50 lb with 50 more to go.	30
0	Lol this gets banned yet a lot of the verified people are just skinnyfat fucks... and no I'm not fat or a fat sympathiser	30
0	So .., not fucking fat chicks is rape? I'm so very consufed.	30
0	TIL using personal discretion is oppression.	30
0	Plus some vapes have dangerous chemicals in them because they aren't regulated.	30
0	Certainly agree, as a woman that used to have low self esteem, this is true.	30
0	"HE OWNED HER LEVEL:OVER9000" More like "I'm so funny, 18 and #trollin XD"	30
0	&gt; The fact that you don't realize "a tiny bit fat" is still fat is a sign that this sub may not be for you.  The sub is filled with this kind. Small fats who are wannabe shitlords.	30
0	this should be a thing, make this a thing! #HATRS	30
0	Would do you, as long as you weren't fat.	30
0	I'm all for hating on fat people (they aren't people), but this is borderline abusive. She needs to see a dietitian and you need to see a therapist.	30
0	He's not obese, he's just fat.	30
0	I just recently lost my four year old cat due to unknown causes and I can understand how hurt that family must be.  To lose a young animal so suddenly, when they weren't even sick, is terrible.  I have dibs on telling the lady what happened to her dog, so I can giggle while I do it.	30
0	This is rediculous. Americans today live to be offended, every little opinion you have someone will get butt hurt about.   I'd put money on it that if some fat dude tried to get in her pats she'd shoot him down without a second delay. But if it were a chizzled, pretty boy she'd jump him asap.	30
0	Antisocial personality disorder. Just because a woman 'likes' to be beaten doesn't mean you should.	30
0	Yes, they're everywhere and it's awful.	30
0	Well considering that ALL food is organic, it's a pretty weak excuse. It's really not that hard to find out how much there's calories in the food you eat.	30
0	I realize this sub is FPH... but OP, by posting this, you physically are hurting me. God damn.	30
0	Fatpeoplehate is about hating fat people, not some "healthy ideal." Fuck off with that shit.	30
0	what the fuck is your problem? all she said was hello. was her bio asking for skinny guys or something?	30
0	PSA: That is lipstick on her cheeks!!!   If you cut into your skin, you get an inflammatory reaction. No matter how clean the wound, a wound is a wound, and your immune system will cause swelling and redness at the site of the wound to protect from infection.   Her cheeks are not red, they are not puffy. It is lipstick!!!	30
0	It was amazing how easy it was to judge people by their favorite Office character. If the person's fave character is Kevin, that person is a fucking imbecile.	30
0	Why is there so much actual malice towards fat people? I don't understand. Im not fat, but who the fuck cares? Just ignore them and let them die early of health complications. This sub seems like theredpill more and more everyday. Chill people. Chill and love one another. Oh but definitely keep hating on anyone who uses the word trigger or privilege non ironically.	30
0	Have you seen Tumblr?	30
0	I'm more amused by her name. Curwen sounds like a fat Arwen.	30
0	Even though the poster is an obvious troll,the fact that this shit got 359 notes is absolutely out of this world..  I'm not even enraged,im just plain fucking sad	30
0	I did a google image search. What am I supposed to find, exactly?   Here's a little primer on [what happens at a wound site](https://thomasreynolds.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/inflammation.jpg).   It does not matter how clean the wound is, you have bacteria on your skin that live there naturally and your body will mount a defense. It is obvious that the 'girl' in the picture is not having a reaction to the supposed wounds. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that she wounded herself.	30

0	Thank you. Thank you.	30
0	"Your the pregnant one. I ain't eating any of this here shit".	30
0	But we have to have some standards in our shitlording, don't we?	30
0	Ha. Unless this sub is pure satire and I just don't get it.... But why can't I inquire on a sub's motivation?  Im genuinely curious why this sub exists.	30
0	Honestly, it seems those glasses are messing with the picture, the frames are pretty thick.	30
0	This is not true. Not all girls like guys that treat them badly. I certainly don't. I am not sure why people even say this. My SO treat me with respect and love. We been together for more than a decade now.	30
0	&gt;you know what people mean by organic as far as food goes  I honestly don't. Care to tell?	30
0	I also wonder that but feel that's really stupid. Like really dumb and unhealthy. Maybe there's a small percentage of the population that can't get to a healthy body weight, but not the amount that these fat acceptance people are talking about. So why do you hate fat people then? Is it to counter the tumblerinas? Or to improve the overall health of society by shaming fat people? Other?	30
0	Yeah I don't get how people see this as being ripped, very far from it	30
0	Good luck finding a woman with sub 10 body fat... The absolute top female bodybuilders are rarely below 10... Lol this is getting down voted?  Fucking skinnyfat losers	30
0	For the same reason that excess money causes inflation. If you're constantly nice to a girl then she doesn't have to work for your approval. If you're an asshole then compliments are limited and some guys go so far as to never compliment and only "neg". So, a woman will talk to you more (work harder) in hopes of a positive interaction.	30
0	I have no doubt in my mind that everyone who supports this subreddit looks absolutely disgusting in the flesh. Some people are larger than others. Get  the fuck over yourselves. Also before you all start assuming I'm overweight, I'm not.	30
0	You most certainly aren't. &lt;3	30
0	The irony here is that this cat would likely have gone on to sadistically kill innumerable birds, reptiles, and small mammals. Nobody going to go to court for that.  Just saying: it's obviously not the fact that something dies in this story that pisses Reddit off so much. That dog saved lives.  Obeast is still sick for laughing.	30
0	60% of Americans are fat. You're bound to run in to one.	30
0	Gotta love the 'quirky' faces because it knows it's disgusting.	30
0	I would give them fat acceptance, if they were fat. What they are though is morbidly obese, not fat.	30
0	why do you censor yourself?	30

0	Well what was their username?	30
0	No this is just straight up stupid. what the fuck did she do wrong.	30
0	There is a difference between hating fat culture and being a dick;  this guy isn't gonna get a date anywhere. He's a douche.	30
0	You don't say.	30
0	What was the need for this? I'm not even being "fat sympathetic" as the sidebar advises against, this is a girl who is honest, doesn't use camera trickery to hide her fatness, why do this to someone? So uncalled for.	30
0	You're new here, fucking wish I could ban you.	30
0	so this is a troll subreddit? 2/10	30
0	Agh.. I kind of feel bad for her. You didn't beat around the bush and you were very concise; this is probably what she needed to hear.	30
0	Then they can send a PM.	30
0	So where do you stand on powerlifters?	30
0	Now, now, there's no reason to use that language.    Sure they posted a series of images instead of linking directly to the article, but OP's not a *cunt.*  He's a *faggot.*	30
0	But they choose to be fat and do so to gain an advantage in arguably one of the most grueling sports in the world. Do they deserve hate?  By the way if your scrawny ass hated on one of them to their face and not from behind the safety of behind your computer, you'd get torn in half.	30
0	My cousin gets fatter every time I see her too. Difference is she's 27 and should know better.	30
0	&gt;Feminism is about political, economic, and social equality of the sexes.   Then buy me a drink!	30

0	This thread is harsh lol	30
0	Reddit isn't social media. I wanted their reddit username since they broke rules of this sub so I could ban them.	30
0	Haha you sound lonely. So instead of bettering yourself, you get mad. sorry.	30
0	Why didn't you just say so? lol!  EDIT: did --&gt; didn't	30
0	Duh since we are on reddit.	30
0	Them fat chicks all be like https://youtu.be/f_GruNNmbKM	30
0	I don't think questioning an image based on what I know to be true is "talking out your ass".	30
0	Do you believe your cat was on your property or theirs when it happened?	30
0	Did your baby's daddy not come through with his child support check again?  Aw, shoot.  Nevermind then.	30
0	Sorta like cat owners who let their cats wander around a neighborhood and kill anything smaller than they are? Right?	30
0	watch your tone you over privileged cum dumpster.	30
0	I'm sorry to have offended you by suggesting that the photo was not real?   I believe you that scarification is a real thing, I just thought she faked it.	30
0	...Literally?  Gross.	30
0	I really don't understand how my "running around the comments section saying its fake, its lipstick" hurt anyone. And I did present the basis for my claim, which is that wound leads to inflammation.   Obviously, my evidence turned out to be incomplete/shoddy, but I still had a basis for my claim and provided it. ???	30

0	thats great flair! haven't thought of anything good for me yet...	30
0	I don't think those are stretch marks. Looks like she cuts.	30
0	do hams even physics?	30
0	Sorry that this is offtopic, but I'm also subscribed to AN AMATEUR RADIO AKA HAM SUBREDDIT so "Ham" means something completely different.  Leading to heelarious misunderstandings.  http://i.imgur.com/linkremoved. it was an image of AN AMATEUR RADIO SUBREDDIT that had the word "ham" in it.	30
0	I don't agree with you, but I DO agree with the upset chubsters part and I do see where you are coming from with their body shapes. (They aren't toned in my opinion, which makes me see them as unattractive, BUT I don't think they're fat either, since it looks like their BMI's are under 25. ) so no unnecessary downvotes to you, fellow shitlord.	30
0	This, this is why I could never be a tattooist	30

0	"You're to fat to be on the internet kill yourself now." Best advice.	30
0	Sorry to break the circle-jerk "ew thats so gross" discussion but that looks incredibly fake. There's no depth to the "cuts" on her cheek, and you can still see the skin underneath the makeup or ketchup or whatever she used for red stuff.  Also I don't think she's tough enough to be smiling after cutting that off, let's be honest.  For comparison, here is what actual scarification looks like: http://i.imgur.com/hi73t9N.jpg  So yeah. She wasn't brave enough to cut her cheeks or anything, she's just a dumb fat liar.	30
0	Yeah, didn't think so... Trust me, I wasn't asking because I wanted to find one.	30
0	To be fair you were incredibly rude. I don't know when hating fat lifestyle and being an asshole became mutually inclusive.	30
0	As a short guy who never had a problem getting endless pussy, height actually can be controlled:  1. Abs make a guy look 2 inches taller 2. Confidence makes a guy look 6 inches taller 3. Being surrounded by hot women makes a guy look 12-16 inches taller  But I do agree with you in the general sense.	30
0	I changed it, is that ok?  though I think that's a stupid rule in some cases, like this one. I would understand if it was like r haes or w/e. (I DONT KNOW IF THAT EXISTS SO IF THAT LINKS IT SORRY)	30
0	I am prepared to be downvoted, but for clarity I shall ask this question. Do we hate all fat people or just the fat people that refuse to admit they are disgusting garbage? Because if they mind their own business, isn't it a bit cruel to hate them?	30
0	Anyone who wears glasses like those instantly becomes punchable.	30
0	Doesn't say how she died.	30
0	Hahaha. I'm so happy I was xposted here. I lurk all the time!!! Trust me guys. I ain't no ham planet. I've run several ironmans and marathons in competitive times. So what if I eat McDs? That shits good yo.  Stop posting in the legal advice thread. I was banned there and can't comment. If you wanna talk shit message me here.	30
0	Actually one has a beautiful son and is a model. Thank though :)	30
0	What the hell??  How can someone insist that their fat is someone else's opinion??	30
0	Fucking Redditors… seriously.  Also fucking fatties and their child palates, can't handle a bit of fucking flavour everything has to be the same bland beige mush.	30
0	These creatures are not insulted, unlike the obeasts.	30
0	That rodent or bird could easily be somebody's pet in their yard or on their patio.  Sure, that was sociopathic, but irresponsible cat owners inflict the same emotional pain on people with smaller pets.	30
0	Haha haha. Here's a pic I snapped at the Singapore Marathon. That's right. I flew to Singapore just to run a marathon. Not fat and not poor. Unlike you, welfare baby.   http://imgur.com/49CQ4Io	30
0	Fat people shouldn't be able to own pets. I don't know why other than because they're fat.	30
0	Can you guys lay off her for a minute? She has a chronic injury.	30
0	&gt; Not all girls like guys that treat them badly.  They do, they just don't know it yet. That's why girls cheat on their nice guy boyfriends or husbands with assholes.	30
0	The fucked up thing is that I am actually mortally allergic to raw onion.  Not only is McDonalds in Australia disgusting, it's usually staffed by 15 year old indian / korean kids with zero grasp of the English language who don't understand the concept of "If I eat onion, I can die".   #1 reason I get Subway if I want fast food. At least the staff at my local store know me and don't try and poison me every time I come in.  Edit: What's with the downvotes?	30
0	You owe me a new laptop OP, I jumped and punched my screen when I opened that. Should have a NSFL tag.	30
0	I agree. I'm not one of those.	30
0	I'm at 5 months and have gained 3 lbs woot woot! (mostly due to loosing 10lbs during morning sickness) I'm not planing on gaining any more than what I should. So far all my friends/family have lost the weight in 3 months because they didn't gain more than what was expected and had no time to eat after the baby was born. Fat tub of lards who use this as a time to "eat for two" are disgusting. Pregnant woman should eat no more than an extra 100 calories and they should be veggies not junk food. Okay sorry rant over.	30
0	TBH this person might have some other issues making it difficult to walk , like one leg being a bit longer or having a simple fucking broken bone	30
0	Well I take a meal replacement protein in strawberry shortcake flavour but find shakes dont ever fill me up, so i usually mix it with 30g of oats or 150g of low fat yoghurt to create a really filling snack	30
0	Lose about 25. Then you'll be a healthy BMI. You can do it! And come back when you do!	30

0	You're a pretty cool guy OP. Nothing like being an asshole to people for the acceptance of online people you'll likely never meet!	30
0	Wow.  That sounds like what racists white people said about what people.  " they're not human they're property"    The comment was intended to be hurtful.  Do you ever see a man in a wheel chair and ask him if he's been out for a walk lately?    It's deliberate,  it's verbal harassment.  It's intention is to hurt.  How sad.	30
0	He's not even *that* fucking fat. At least the dude's happy.	30

0	He may be my new favorite shitlord.	30
0	That's not what I'm arguing at all. No, I didn't see any size 12 models, because they'd not be models. And my two 5'11 size 12 and 14 friends are fat. "Small fats", but fat.  We're arguing past each other, and we're hitting different things. You're agitated and misunderstanding me and seem to be taking offense where none is meant, so for the sake of ruffled feathers, I'll leave the issue be.   Ugh, not that it matters, but seriously. Some of those pictures can't be US size 12s. There's just no realistic way.	30
0	Personally, I'd rather hang out with someone who is heavier and trying to better themselves than some skinny-ish hipster fuckwad who thinks a burning weed on fire next to their face is cool. At least I know that they are real and just not trying to deflect their own inadequacies onto someone else because of an inherent character flaw. They can lose weight, you fucks will still stink unless you stop.	30
0	I see.  Thanks for clearing that up,  it was so very vague.   It does make me wonder though what the mental and emotional estate of the people here is.   It takes a special person to walk around hating others for being fat.  Ever heard of self projecting?  I hope whatever causes you guys pain stops soon so you can stop trying to hurt others as a means to alleviate it.   2015 and this is a thing.  How sad.	30
0	I only lived there for a few years. I am in a big city right now. But the trashy horrors I've witness still haunts me to this day.	30
0	Its a dude who runs marathons. He's just really picky	30
0	It is true. And she is actually considered " Beautiful " in even societis standards. This photo itself is 10 years old. The main point I bring is this is posted in a "fat hating" site...and its not focused on that. So it should be removed.	30
0	Banned until you can prove your status as human.	30
0	:rolleyes: because it's impossible to fake a scar, right	30
0	On another note, if they can't get a simple order right then why the fuck do you deserve getting paid 15$/hr?	30
0	Tbh you could've said more interesting things, especially if you knew in advance you were gonna submit it here. Boring/10	30
0	One day j hope to be guilded. Nothing in 2 whole years. (On my other account)	30
0	We hate all fats until they are human.  It's very simple, actually.	30
0	I remember everyone hated her because she said it didn't hurt to have her baby, she didn't get all screaming and crazy and she was only in labor for a short time.	30
0	The dog didn't do anything.	30
0	The moderators did remove the photo. Last nigHt. And someone else reposted it. If I could get my photobucket.com to work I'd post a photo link to what she looks like now she is FAR from ugly which is why the comments need to start. Everyone takes bad pictures. This just happens to be one. She used to smoke cigs and drink a lot of soda. Her teeth are not this bad anymore and she really is considered a beautiful woman.	30
0	Go cuddle the little dude! :c This shit makes me sad.	30
0	It looks like a bad angle to me. He's definitely not fit, but he's also not obese.	30
0	Uh. No. Cats might hunt rodents but the rodents are nimble enough to get away. A small kitten's motor skills are horrible. He didn't stand a chance.  edit: Someone is downvoting all of my posts :) Good, good, let the hate flow.	30
0	I see.  Thanks for showing me the door :)	30
0	I used to live in a small duplex in a dingy Texan neigborhood (I guess white trash would be a more apt descriptor than 'ghetto') and there were like ten pitbulls. Eight of which were angry and terrifying, two of which were adorable and really sweet. Guess which eight were owned by fatties. And guess which eight were allowed to roam freely and their owners didn't give a shit?  I think two of those eight were used in dog fighting :c   The other two were owned by our really sweet neighbors and got along with our cats :D It was adorable!	30
0	To be honest you were being quite rude. Just saying "hi, I'm not really interested in you" would suffice. I'm not defending her. This sub is slowly turning into /r/atheism it's getting ridiculous	30
0	Have you tried hairless cats? :D No allergy problems!	30

0	hes just walking around causing so much bad luck.	30
0	Probably. D:  Strangely enough, even though I gave them a cup of food each twice a day, the black ball managed to be seemingly fat...I'm going to guess the neighbors were feeding him because the other one wasn't getting skinnier.	30
0	I am not condoning hamness, but seeing fat people at a gym is good because they are at least not like the others and actually try to get rid of it right?	30
0	... uh. you should FINISH the 5k in thirty minutes..	30
0	Holy fuck,  only one person in this shit sub has 2 brain cells that recognize trolling.   Edit: I'm doubling down. To have so much hatred in your heart that you belong to a community dedicated to open disdain for your fellow man, you aren't likely to be a good human being. So yeah, I think you are all pathetic, as pathetic as the HAES crowd you criticize	30
0	Eh, your calorie intake can be pretty high with a lot of exercise.  I do about 2 hours of walking a day on average (I walk to all my meetings, its much more pleasant.  CitiBike if I'm in a rush) and an hour of cycling.  Weekends, its 4 hours of intense riding each day if I have the time, if I don't its because I'm doing yardwork.  So I end up with a pretty damn high calorie intake.  So I've ordered two large meals from cracker barrel before, the chicken and dumplings is a delicious treat.	30
0	Those stretch marks gross me out so fucking much	30
0	I agree but atleast Gabriel iglecias is funny.	30
0	How do stretch marks even happen? when I started to work out I got a few somewhere on my shoulder close to my armpit but it's not really visible. Do you gain stretch marks at rapid weight gain or can it also accumulate over time? I'm pretty afraid to get more of those at places where they are actually visible from gaining muscles mostly because I have a friend that has some nasty stretch marks around the same areas as me but at more visible places	30

0	Lmao, i found a sub for cunts! Does it make you guys feel good about yourselves hating on fat fucks all day? What an interesting hobby...	30
0	Same. Like I hope it isn't. And what would I do with the info if it is her? O.o	30
0	Going to crosspost this on autismpeoplehate because only an autist would be that fucking stupid not to know the obvious troll is obvious	30
0	I know, I've watched it before. He's not wrong. Dj'ing is basically pressing play and fading in a new song. But if a DJ sucks because they have no taste, crowd control or creativity, the dance floor will be dead. Sometimes people want high energy, sometimes they need to catch their breath. That is the art of DJ'ing. Pressing play is just a step in the process.	30
0	to be fair, that's any stand-up today.	30
0	Woah I overslept and woke up to 980 up votes, holy shit! Anyway I think a lot of you are missing the point. It doesn't matter whether the post is satire, I saw it and thought it was serious. Which means that there are other people in the world that took it seriously, and they're probably fat. Just hate the fatties and forget the picture.	30

0	don't genetics actually have a decent role in this though? I have a friend who eats a shit ton of food (at least when we eat together) and he's still skinny. he says it's because of ethiopian genetics	30
0	Is that? Yes it is! A dick bulge.	30
0	Bonus Tyrone in the back.	30
0	New user. Haven't even been on reddit for a week. Give it another 4 days and I will have my verification and you will still be retarded.	30
0	dont give up on them : /  edit: its my cake day wowowowo didnt notice	30
0	If you are too lazy to understand the implication of a persons cat dying in their own yard vs their neighbors then you are the mental equivalent of a lazy fat person.	30
0	Wasn't sorry, just lifted the ban :P	30
0	If it only shed this much in a month in would still be unacceptable and evidence of not working at all.	30
0	Oh so now we're just posting pictures of small spaces and calling them shitlord? It's just a space that normal people can get through. Jesus can you either get a little more creative or just post pictures of fat people. This is getting retarded.	30
0	My TDEE is 2300 and I'm on a 1000 calorie deficit, so I regularly eat less than 1286/day. As I have been for months.	30

0	Edit: I'm an idiot. Carry on.	30
0	I'm curious as to how you jumped from me calling out op for his shitty post style to me being HAES.	30
0	Ha! My wife gained less than Gisele Bundchen!	30
0	I just automatically assume anyone fat and bitching is a female.	30
0	Personally I go to a fast food place if I don't have the time to make a proper meal. Other than that. I make my own food	30
0	Thats biting the hand that feeds you...literally	30
0	at this point is this sub posting photos of mentally ill people? Are you going to post pics of people with Downs Syndrome next?	30
0	If you think I'm supporting it, you haven't really read my post.	30
0	Where at all did it mention the person's weight or figure? Or are you guys just assuming that he is a fat person because he eats at a fast food restaurant and has an irrational hatred of the place?  I get hating severely obese people and their "cundishuns" but if you guys want any credibility in the fight, don't do things that make you overtly seem like a douche bag.	30
0	Funny, I didn't know this but always make a point to avoid organic food. Non-organic always looks happier haha.	30
0	&gt; My cat was older and loved to sleep on the outside porch, well one night the neighbors two big dogs somehow got out and mauled my cat to death  No, this comment thread is about an old cat, not the kitten.  Quit being lazy.	30
0	&gt; Lol what. If you're eating a burger that is afternoon.  I think you're giving fatties too much credit.	30
0	Wow, this place has really taken a McCarthyist turn...	30
0	&gt; I guess you've never heard of grammar or "animal cruelty"  You're a bit of a lazy ass hypocrite.  In the same goddamn thread no less.  Also, it seems like your laziness extends into pet ownership as well, as it's squarely your fault you let your cat out and it never came home.  And yet, here you are, trying to rationalize your shittiness  to a stranger on the internet by somehow arguing that I condone killing animals, rather than accepting the fact that your wandering stray cat is a fucking liability.	30
0	It's cool if you agree and don't want to admit it.	30
0	It saddens me... A lot of whales would actually look pretty cute at a reasonable weight, this one's obviously an exception...	30
0	I bet you didn't even really fat shame anyone. Just simply not accepting the offer is a crime against humanity. Her sorority is probably like "What is his problem? Just date her already! She likes him!"	30
0	No one likes to be punched in the cervix.	30
0	Listen, I want to be firmly on the record as saying that the obesity epidemic in America needs to be a hot topic of discussion. I think that a lot of Americans could do more to take better care of themselves, and this idea of "big and beautiful" or "healthy at every size" is going to severely cripple what is currently an already fucked up healthcare system.  I just think that in order to effectively have that conversation, credibility needs to be maintained. And bullshit like this thread takes away from the credibility of people that want to speak about fitness and healthy diet.	30
0	Then they would loose 500 pounds!!!	30
0	Salty hams must be in here, downvoting you.  5k would take about an hour at normal walking pace, but that's just regular ambling about, not in a hurry walking. 30 minutes is not a huge challenge.	30
0	Yeah, but... what if she's just keeping off enough weight for the rides? In that case, her motivation makes many, many people suffer having to be next to her almost too fat for the ride ass.	30
0	Wow is this whole discussion sad and sick. Life us full of variances. Deal with it.	30
0	&gt;This thing here is actually trying to unfatten itself!  So?   Banned.	30
0	Then this ban won't be so hurtful.   Enjoy FatLogic!	30

0	you cant lose fat and gain muscle at the same time. It's one, then the other.	30
0	You were at an 'all you can **eat**' buffet......that's fat country, right there.   In fact, Op, I'm a little suspicious of your credentials. An all you can eat buffet and you claim to not be fat.....smells fishy.	30
0	Dead on, though more like "Just bang her already!".  They couldn't comprehend me not wanting dat V. Jokes on them, I had a friends w/benefits at the time. Pisses me off at their attitude though.	30
0	"A lot of people...turn into garbage disposals..."	30
0	Man, it must really suck to be a prosecutor named Jonathan Fail.	30
0	All you can eat buffets are a fat institution, and you seem pretty wrapped up in getting into fat style food like pizza and chips.   And I've lived in England:all you can eat buffets over there are full of fat people just like all you can eat buffets the fat world over.	30
0	You're missing the point entirely.    Fit black men dating fat black women is entirely common. Black men tend to gravitate towards bigger women. Its all throughout the culture from the music to real life.	30
0	Okay, he passed my randomly clicking through the video test, but the special was called "elephant in the room" so I'm going to fail him anyway because of that.	30
0	He looks like a pimple that needs to be popped	30
0	Well I may be misspoken as 34C and not a 36C.  She was a size small in clothing.  But her rack was great.  As I mentioned in my edit her boobs were fake.  She'd have been a B cup without her enhancement.   You could definitely send me a picture of your boobs and I could compare them to my pictures of hers I kept over the years.	30
0	In what universe is ONE McDonald's burger a day cutting back?	30

0	Read the two first sentences and though this was about abortions.	30
0	I'm disappointed, but I give it 6 hours.  RemindMe! 6 hours	30
0	Same reason college seniors love sneaking freshmen into bars and clubs. But that's because bars and clubs have legal oblications to keep under-aged people out. Why the fuck is there an age rule here?	30
0	True... But surely OP couldn't be... But then again he isn't confirmed non-fat.	30
0	Get the fuck out of here for common sense LOL your name suits you. honestly fuck this sub and the people who are actually subbed to it. you guys are retarded as fuck it's pathetic to the point that being a fat cow is better since they actually have social lives. fuck this garbage sub you autistic ignorant fucks hahahahha	30
0	Uh, yeah? My family has known that for years. We rehydrate onions when we want to make imitation McBeetus burgers at home lol.	30
0	All fats are fair to laugh at.    Banned.	30
0	Bitch keeps eating and she's going to need pleats.	30
0	She does look like something that beached itself.	30
0	ummm, whats your beef with Krillin?	30
0	her eating championship trophies, apparently.	30
0	That one on the left isn't helping the cause either.	30
0	I can't anymore.	30
0	&gt;There is still hope for the guy in the picture.   No. Banned.	30
0	His lard ass was the backup. That old bitch shamed his tubby ass and beat the cat down with that club of hers.	30
0	Yeah, god damn. Don't join a group that specifically tries to avoid stereotyping and excluding anyone and then turn around and stereotype and exclude people. What a moron.   I think people like this join because they want a place that's accepting of them, not because they give a shit about helping other people.	30
0	My cousin is almost 400 lbs and was talking about how sick she is. She finishes her story by saying "They're [doctors] not sure what it is, but it's serious." And I was like, "Uh could it be the extra 280 lbs you're carrying around?". But no, it's never the weight that's the problem, the weight is a result of the problems /s	30
0	His character is called "Francis". Yes, that character takes the credit for most of his views.	30
0	I fucking hate fatties in my hobbies	30
0	She's trying to hide her second chin with her hand but she can't hide that inch-thick lump of fat on her forehead.	30
0	Hmm... no. Not gonna check it.	30
0	Benned for fat sympathy.	30
0	Being fat seriously fucks up hormones and can definitely give a woman malr pattern baldness.	30
0	I'm not asking about a second time or not. It's not even about this case in particular...  If i go to restaurant and make it clear that i don't want any peanuts in the food, and the restaurant tells me there are no peanuts, but then i find out there are infact peanuts (cause they almost killed me!), do i have any legal recourse?	30
0	I cringed. Darwinism in full effect here--stupid fatty with several tons of adipose hitting with the largest volume of surface area = hopefully dead fattie.	30
0	I couldn't tell, I don't have a sense of humor.	30
0	You seem to be doing that, lovely.   I didn't care enough to read that because I could care less about you :) I'm done here. Have a nice life.	30
0	here we have a company whos name i forgot selling idk and a disgusting fatty. advertisement fail	30
0	It's times like this I'm super fucking glad I went to art school and couldn't afford food and drugs so I chose drugs and seldom ate well. (Didn't care project deadlines. Drugs and cigarets was all I needed)	30
0	Holly heck she actually drew on the jaw line.	30
0	thin priveledge is being recognizable by face recognition software	30
0	Welcome to reality, where 69% of all adults in the USA are overweight or obese.	30
0	Almost every time i go there (i only get small coffees twice a week before class) I say "three creams and two sugars" It doesn't matter how clearly I say this. 8/10 times they fuck it up. I have to walk in and even then sometimes like ITS NOT THAT HARD  I think I should sue them too hahaha	30
0	Note that the article is super biased towards the fatty, and EVERY shot of her breasts is taken at an angle that a real person wouldn't see (unless they're three feet tall) to minimize what the cleavage looks like. Wtf.	30
0	/r/punchablefaces  EDIT: I agree 100% with him but goddam I want to smack him in his face.	30
0	Please try to find it.	30
0	After I saw pictures I realized I was vaguely aware of her	30
0	It still indicates a distressing lack of self-control and basic judgment. Those restaurants and food are designed expressly for fat fucks to stuff their fat fucking faces with inhuman quantities of toxic garbage. Why would a thin person indulge in that shit? And are they really thin on the inside,  or is there a buttery sweatogre waiting to pop out at the first moment of weakness? Never trust a thin glutton.	30
0	Go cry about rape culture somewhere else, preferably not on a thread about a cat being mauled to death. Learn to make a valid argument as well.	30
0	That took over three years to maybe lose 10lbs? The "loss" might just be fewer clothes, too. Sheesh.	30
0	No points for trying to be normal.	30
0	Not to be mean, but stories go on r/TalesofFatHate.	30
0	Am I the only one who fucking despises fat/shitty cosplayers, they fucking ruin it for everyone else and make other people look fucking stupid	30
0	Maria Bamford is hilarious!   Love her DS9 bits!	30
0	I see they installed [scissor doors](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=scissor+doors) in the yellow Audi so she could get in and out without a crane.	30
0	Meh. I don't think he's THAT bad.  His bit with 'cuba divin' and norklin' is pretty funny.	30
0	Happy hour is only a two-hour window at my university area. It is meant to cheer up students from taking godawful finals; unfortunately, the lards near the area snatch up this offer and instead crowd the lines meant for students.	30
0	so I'm at Walmart and I couldn't help myself. I'm starting to get bolder with getting close and snapping pictures. my wife was all super loud asking why I'm taking pictures of diabetic socks... i wonder how long I can go until she finds my dirty fattie picture snapping secret.	30
0	Eh. Build is too weirdly disproportionate. That's the one condishun I won't make much fun of bc it can happen to anyone.	30
0	RIP hotness, you will be missed	30
0	You should time it next time, maybe you're faster than you think, but since you think you are slow your perception of speed could be different	30
0	Definitely time it next time. If you run regularly then chances are it's not all that bad. I try to aim for 6 minute miles on my runs, and I don't even consider myself that much of a runner. I'm a much stronger cyclist than a runner (mainly because I don't enjoy running, so I do less running than riding), so I figure if I can do it, any decent runner could too.	30
0	Her healthiness and self awareness aside, you come across like a huge asshole.	30
0	Yes! I was waiting for somebody to mention Bo Burnham and Maria Bamford. Doesn't Maria also work on adventure time?	30
0	Gross.  Can anybody translate the text?	30
0	The old bitch on the left is smaller than the lard arse centre stage!  how embarrassing for all involved.  if I were fat/fatter than someone's dad I'd kill myself!	30
0	I don't think even normal stores have TEN different styles of jeans. give me a fucking break. Entitled ham cunts. All the pants look the fucking same.	30
0	It has been done.	30
0	went are you eating junk food op? I hope you're there just to shit to the mother effing lord extreme	30
0	Cigarettes and black coffee cleaned up my hammyness quite nicely.	30
0	You have more respect for an infanticidal beast than for *most* people?	30
0	I never found him funny, not because he is fat. Because I'm mildly racist. And because he is fat.	30
0	Is it just me or does that bulge look like she got a dick,	30
0	She needs a Dr.  Physician, specifically.	30
0	Don't hack /u/wolfsnatch anymore. ;)	30
0	he never said what to use. . . find something painful and large and use it as a dildo. (why yes i do hate that bitch with a passion)	30
0	I think there are plenty of women for whom a BMI of 17 is pretty much fine - it all depends on how you do it.  Agreed though - if you start underweight, you should gain a little more; if you start overweight you should gain less or even lose.	30
0	Wow, thanks for repeating the punchline in the comments! Super helpful, I'm glad you thought it was good.	30
0	I'm going to guess that's the 900 because I can't see her on the 600 and being able to accelerate hard. That said, the ZXR is a fast bike. It may be up to the task.	30
0	I've been meaning to start that series.	30
0	Just something like, I send a greeting to my friend @rossyveth in Panama 😊 excellent motorbike 💪 (you) speed and adrenaline fanatic.  Hmm, adrenaline junky? I dunno about that.	30
0	That's f'n ridiculous. Can you imagine being 11 years old and that big? What kind of life is that?	30
0	You're going to hate me for defending the dad body, but if applied right, the dad body is what most people should aim for. It's a healthy shape when done right. A dad body by the definition I know is a strong frame with a light coating of fat over the top, basically like a constant bulk phase. That pear shaped shit is not a dad body; it's just gross.	30
0	Why are you replying to me?	30
0	If your wife gets fat after having kids/letting herself go....    No point in staying in shape to go home to fuck a pig!	30
0	Chubby, chubbier, chubbiest	30
0	I have a personality flaw. I have made peace with this issue at this point. Thank you for your judgment though. Lol.          Edit: this is not to say I don't appreciate the judgment. It's the only thing that keeps in in check these days really. It's an honest thank you.	30
0	An 11 minute mile is a slightly brisk walk.  What are you high on?	30
0	I'm still mad T Monsters all seem to be actually good. Quality work doesn't belong on such a waste of oxygen. I hope she gets cancer or something and loses a fuckton of weight so they all get droopy with loose skin and look like deformed shit	30
0	Give him time. It's a phase. I'm still very red pill, I just don't feel the need to talk about it every five seconds. If you continue reading the thread, I think you'll understand a bit more.	30
0	Its in the sidebar and wiki.	30
0	Come back when you are 18, friend.	30
0	Time spent in drive through is probably 5-10 minutes. Buy some ham when you go shopping. Slap it on a piece of bread. BAM! Just saved yourself 4-9 minutes every single fucking day.	30
0	Feminism might be retarded, but it's certainly no excuse for being a fat fuck either.	30
0	There is that "skinny fat" phenomenon	30
0	You notice when she poses she always tries to do a "sexy" look?   It's hilarious.	30
0	Oh how the mighty fall...	30
0	Bro she looks like she's trying to reverse cowgirl the air.	30
0	You must be a ton of fun at parties	30
0	This sub encourages people to be a healthy weight. We call people out for being overweight. We can also encourage people to seek help if they might be severely underweight.  To not do so is irresponsible and makes this sub look supportive of anorexia. There are people here with eating disorders who have used fat hate as another excuse to avoid eating.	30
0	Places like /r9k/ and even red pillers constantly go on about the benefits of finding an asian wife. And they will love you because you are white.	30

0	what kills me is that if he worked out, stopped eating so much crappy food, and got rid of the math teacher beard, I can tell that he would probably not look to damn bad. He doesn't even have to be really thin, either! Just... not goddamn obese! it's such a shame :(  But at that point, I doubt his personality would really be the problem, if he's willing to work hard and improve himself he'd be handsome anyway as well as less obese.	30

0	I lol'd because you lol'd	30
0	This is why I hate family guy, fat guy, not fat wife.  No one needs to be fat.  I would future divorce the shit out of future spouse if he got fat.  I told him he has the right to do the same to me if I get fat.	30

0	Then only doctor that approves of the haes is dr.pepper	30
0	Yeah, it could be a variety of fuckwits, not just fat cunts	30
0	Stop lying to yourself, you fat fuck. It's easily achievable if you don't have to worry about your flabby fucking thighs rubbing.  An 11 minute mile is a marginally brisk walk.	30
0	Nope, you're just fucking slow. 20 minutes is totally achievable. 25 if you're not great at power walking. Longer if you're a wheezy fat cunt, of course.	30
0	Not really middle of nowhere, though. I'm not that rural lol. But most of the way isn't exactly city either.	30
0	Looks like a chunky dude	30
0	This is some hardcore level guess the gender	30
0	http://i.imgur.com/6YagiZ8.jpg Does the cat goes up or down the stairs? Hard to know for sure.  It's easier to play this game with an obese like tess, because then the answer is "no".	30
0	Agreed. CBC has become Fox News North over the last nine years. I miss the days when it was our respected public broadcaster/news agency.	30
0	Not necessarily true, I weigh just about double what I should, and honestly, I have no issues with mobility and getting up, although I'm probably right on the verge of it which scares me, so I hope I can get my fucking act together soon.	30
0	Its like a sexy dress on here	30
0	I prefer women with meat on that, six pack on a women turns me off. Skinny fat.	30
0	Wtf why the jab at stoners? Just because you smoke weed you like ham planets? You are putting stoners in the same league as people you claim are genuinely mentally messed up, for what reason? Literally most cringeworthy thing ive read  Weed is about as bad for you as ibuprofen or nyquil, its not like it fucks up your brain dude.	30
0	6'3", 205. Don't have a six pack but definitely have that dad body going on and the women love it.	30
0	YUM, the white ones are my fav, the powder ones are not that bad for your heart. . The choco donuts by tastykakes are delicious but worthy of a heart attack. Perfer tasty brand then the store brands. Little debbie/hostess tastes like crap now, I remember I had some packages reeking of "paint" smell! Never again.	30
0	I just checked my bag of white rice and it's actually 640 calories/cup	30
0	He's getting downvoted because his app glitched and it posted his comment 11 times.	30
0	Just a quick update- I've tried to fix my diet and have started a couch-to-5k running program. I'm starting week 3 tomorrow, and now weigh 136 lbs, and measure 37-28-39. Not much difference, but it's still progress!	30
0	It looks like the material is see through and she's wearing a black or navy blue bra. That's not classy. Its not always about how much it covers.	30
0	That was a bit of a dick move. He deleted his comment as well. We shouldn't be discouraging future shitlords.	30
0	Dude, lady, whatever you are. You are talking about a human being versus an animal. In the animal world it is kill or be killed. Cats are not a top predator, we are. You're comparing interspecies rape to the food chain. I'm not going to pretend that you even have a valid point because it simply is not. If you were saying, "well maybe we shouldn't let little girls out in short skirts because a cannibal might consume them", we'd have a discussion. But that's not the case so I'm gonna run along now.	30
0	Eh, not really, at least, it was more of an "I just don't care" then a "Im not THAT fat" but either way, I know I have problems, and I know its up to me to fix them.	30
0	Going off of BMI maybe, i'm at 17 percent body fat 6'3" 205 but still considered overweight.	30
0	Hello, former fat person here.....sometimes you can get fat and its not your fault...but it is when you dont change it after you realize it.	30
0	I feel like 15-16 is a good stopping point for feeling bad for fat kids. If there's one thing I hate seeing, it's overweight, elementary school age children..	30
0	They got equal rights a loooong time ago dude. The word for wanting equal rights is egalitarian anyway.	30
0	That's why I said keep them inside. No, it's not okay for an animal to get mauled to death. I have 3 cats, all bengals. They're allowed outside with supervision and happily come back inside when it's time. If you love your animals you protect them. A predator doesn't have the cognition to stop and say, "Hey is killing this thing morally right?" No. Seriously though, goodbye now. Opinions will not be changed, clearly.	30
0	I wonder if anyone ever got stuck you would have to get a crane to tug them out. Can just imagine the butthurt fatties and their triggers demanding the crack be made larger.	30
0	On the show, his excuse was that men don't respond to shame. What he really meant was: "I'm trying to make money off neckbeards, I can't offend them so I  blame women for their problems".	30
0	I miss matching bathing suits on girls.	30
0	Come back when you're human you fuck, you're not allowed here. Don't you get that? We hate you.	30
0	Fat women are actually given harsher sentences on average to men or attractive women. So...	30
0	I don't frequent this sub (but I do agree with most of its sentiments) is it just any fatso gets banned or ones trying to defend themselves?  I guess I'll find out now won't I? haha	30
0	I never realized how big her ears were... maybe that's her plan. Balloon up so that she's proportionate with her ears.	30
0	It sucks that he's so tall. I feel a special kind of hate towards tall fatties because if they got off their asses and worked out then they would be especially attractive, even moreso than short fit people	30

0	I prefer the 25-30 range myself. Abs and muscles on a woman are just not that attractive to me.	30
0	Oh, come on. That is just a large woman in *every* sense of the word! She looks super tall, broad shoulders, etc. And she is actually **working**, not sitting at home collecting disability because of "diabeetus". We have bigger, lazier targets...	30

0	Either her nipple takes up the entirety of the bottom of the fat sacks, or she has some majir discoloration. .. i dont want to know	30
0	Good for you! I've actually lost 50lbs since the beginning of my diet and I'm feeling great! I've had bad days too, I'm having one today actually (I'm eating Belgian chocolates as we speak, hehe) but there's another today tomorrow, isn't there? :)  I'm currently standing at 410lbs, which is huge, but I'm determined to lose it all. You've my and this entire sub's full support!  **Edit:** Seems like I'm getting downvoted by HAES warriors, Mods HELP!  **Edit II:** Fat bitches hating on a sister losing weight, surprise surprise!	30
0	*appetizer. No way is that sufficient calories to maintain that ... man?	30
0	Yep...it's a thing...As for why? You'd best ask tumblr	30
0	Alright, but I'm still waiting for that verification	30
0	Hahahaha keep us updated if she finds out she's on here. I could picture her posting up dramatic crap how we are *sooooo* terrible and have a HAES movement :p	30
0	&gt;Wastes life getting high  &gt;Has self respect  Pick one.	30
0	Gotcha. Found it anyhow. Shame OPs weight loss isn't matching their down votes.	30
0	This sickens me. This is probably the main reason why I'm afraid to have children, because of the stupidity il be around during events. Give your shitchild a high five from me.	30
0	i dont know if this comment will ever get enough credit, this is amazing	30
0	I'm also referring to the amount of butter and syrup slipped on it. Guess I'll be more specific next time	30
0	But why you would eat pizza, burger and drink soda? If you have to eat 3k cal per day, that's not the proper food to do it :/	30
0	My arms are exactly like hers (perhaps a little bigger even - 410lbs now but dieting and losing weight) and I consider myself as a pretty strong person. I won a lot of arm wrestling contests actually, it's hilarious! :)  **Edit:** HAES activists are brigading again! Mods HALP!	30
0	MODS MODS I need an adult	30
0	lol @ your total ignorance.	30
0	No matter how much you hate someone, saying anyone deserves to be raped crosses the line. Dial it back a bit.	30
0	Read my other reply. When I say feminism, I am specifically referring to that which exists in the western world. My apologies for the confusion, you make a valid point.	30
0	GOMAD. Take your current daily diet, add a gallon of whole milk. You will gain weight.	30
0	Giving the mods something to do besides jerking off, they're welcome!	30
0	If she left a tip it may have covered the cost. While I agree with the Uber driver a person more suitable to break this sort of news to her would be a doctor you feel me?  Edit: After further analysis I believe that those whom replied to me did not feel me. I am however going to stand by what I said and stay true to my word. Keep those down votes coming, you all have an opinion which I'm willing to listen to.	30
0	the whole statistic is totally false. made up by some dude at the UN, for a speech he gave. he later admitted that it was made up. can't remember the specifics since i heard about it on some radio show, but anyone who's angry at me for calling it on its bullshit would do well to look it up. confirmation bias is a real bitch	30
0	Yeah let's put a label on it and make it not their fault. "Aw the poor fat asses just couldn't help, it's their mental disorder... " It is entirely their fault. Stop with this bullshit. You are the people that try to justify why they're so fat, instead of realizing it's pure laziness.	30
0	great rebuttal, seems that all his complaints have been nullified and all is well in the world	30
0	I find nothing funny about his brand of "humor" nor do I find his redpill fan boys coming on this sub and spreading their filth about how men can be fat but women can't etc etc. I'm honestly glad that human garbage Roosh got humiliated on TV.	30
0	It's on her back! Naaaasty.	30
0	It's the cloud storage to use if you want to endorse products made by fatties.  No thanks.	30
0	Some people truly can't gain weight. My best friend had this issue. His doctor even had him on a 3000 calorie a day diet because he couldn't gain. Even if he ate we'll over that, he still couldn't gain weight. The only way he's been able to is ridiculous amounts of protein and lots of gym time.	30
0	Point for use of copious	30
0	Did you not read the part where she missed her bus, I definitely am not a fan of ham planets but pulling lines to fix your narrative makes you look bad	30
0	I don't give a shit about /r/fatpeoplehate rules, indeed! I also don't give a shit about being in other people's spaces, deal with it! Airlines are on our side (I've witnessed skinny bitches getting kicked off the airplane because I needed their seat) so cry me a river!  I'm not racist, just can't stand white people and their hate for minorities!	30
0	I started losing my shit when girls thought it was acceptable to stop shaving their armpits. It's not even cosmetic, it's hygienic, but I guess these fatties don't have a clue about either.	30
0	Prevalence stats?    I know more than one person like him growing up. Some kids who would always eat way more than me. By that mean way more. Like entire pizza for dinner for more. Like three times through the lunchline more. And they were always sticks. And only one of them that I know of ballooned up. It's funny we actually used to call him sugar monster. He ate candy after candy after candy constantly. You never saw him without candy and he was never fat. Well e moved away, and when he came back to visit a few years later he was HUGE.	30
0	I think I have a new type	30
0	Then, because so many people are obeasts, they will change the qualification of what obese is. Temporarily numbers will drop and the world will continue its' downward spiral	30
0	1/10, obvious troll is obvious.	30
0	The mods are going to ban you!	30
0	If they do this they will no longer get the "arm exercises" of using high myspace angles and get even more fat.	30
0	Really? They've already banned me today under my original account /u/Societalhate today - I guess I can post as long as I can count.	30
0	Jesus, he's fatter than the newborn. How do you beat a newborn at BMI?	30
0	Your IP  address can also be banned.	30
0	Another way to get them back would be to adopt a kid from a family with a "history of obesity" and raise that kid right. Then when people say "muh genetics" your kid can point out their real family history and call them on their bullshit. Save a kid in more ways than one.	30
0	I think I love you too 💜	30
0	I can't find it. Reapproved.	30
0	They probably meant discussions about diet and acne, as there is as yet no conclusive evidence to support that diet affects acne.   Edit: Why the fuck am I being downvoted? It's not my fault if you people don't know how to science.	30
0	Gallon of milk is under $4, lactase pill is 9 cents. Call it $120/month. If you can't afford to spend $120/month on a bulking diet, that's different than not knowing how to go on a bulking diet.	30
0	And now? Going to ban me again? At least you're getting a little exercise today, skinny fat bitch!	30
0	Hopefully she won't listen to the fatties trying to bring her back to the dark side.  One healthy, skinny straight guy's opinion:  The first pic she's a **VERY Weak** six. (That's being very generous...) She's firmly in the: "Get me drunk first." category.  The second pic she's easily an 8.  Losing weight can do wonders for your attractiveness, ladies. Like jumping 2-3 points or more on the 10-point scale.	30
0	Just one more time, for fun?	30
0	It looks Turkish or middle-eastern. Too much lamb and falafel. Immigrant for sure.	30
0	I teach high school. Hell I remember being in high school. People do weird things to get attention. Luckily there was no internet around for my generation to make lasting asses out of ourselves.	30
0	Wah, wah. Someone called you on your bullshit on the Internet - where will you make grossly unnecessary and insensitive jokes about rape now? Grow the fuck up.	30
0	http://www.acne.org/diet.html  4 studies to date with some serious flaws.	30
0	XD i like teh weedz	30
0	Obese I understand hating on but slightly overweight fat pisses me off. I run like 5 miles a day &amp; eat healthy &amp; still can't drop from 180 to 170. Stupid metabolism.	30
0	What they don't realize is if they lost weight, a lot of it, they have the features to be a pretty attractive person.	30
0	You people are dicks. And liars. Bottomline.	30
0	I can imagine she was heavily complaining about missing her bus and how it's the bus drivers fault enough to validate a comment of fitness. While I agree with your comment. Killing them with kindness would have avoided the driver a bad review which I'm confident she left.	30
0	Found the feminist.  Pink hair, septum ring, bisexual?	30
0	&gt;  diet had anything to do with your skin   It doesn't really.   Edit: You people are acting like the fucking hams you make fun of, why don't you show me some fucking sources you pseudoscience believing fucking idiots	30
0	Sad part about that is that her facial features looks a bit like Kaley Cuoco's. If she stopped shovelling food into her face for five minutes she could be really attractive.	30
0	Dis is what will get you diabeettteesssz. Unless you woke up with 2000000 pounds of junk food and 2000 gallons of soda in your body, then no you didn't "wake up like dis". But it is obviously a cundishions.	30
0	No, /u/Weird_in_Bed, I love *you*.	30
0	25 for me   Little cushin for the pushin	30
0	A sad cow down voted you. I fixed that.	30
0	I think it's implied that this is a breakfast meal, not dessert, not a treat. There's nothing healthy about serving candy for breakfast. I agree with you.	30
0	Posting that here let's other people share that they also liked it, and gives a space where people can expand on the joke, providing further entertainment, assbutt .	30
0	I have access to the write ups. Even reading the abstracts of the studies highlights their glaring flaws. At the end of the day they are very weak, so it's a bit of a stretch to say that 4 studies, that include a self-reporting survey and a questionnaire, are "evidence for a link" between Glycemic Index and acne.	30
0	I have no idea why you're being downvoted for speaking the truth. Maybe we should start an #acnelogic sub.	30
0	I bet you have an amazing body and have Tom Brady's athleticism and good looks. 😆	30
0	Thanks for your response! And yeah if I'm not good enough to respect, my house isn't good enough to spend all day in, either. And yes my boyfriend can be a dill weed, I wish he didn't feel the need to always be hanging out with people. And if he does, why not pick better people lol	30
0	Zac Effron is lookin like a swole mole in that pic.	30
0	This fat deserves a pass. He actually contributes to the world and didn't ask to be seen or heard (until he was forced).	30
0	Also, many uber drivers do it on the side...I've talked to some who do it maybe twice a week for 2-4 hours during busy hours.	30
0	You're right I should've said some women	30
0	Can you pm me these links? I'm too curious for my own Good.	30
0	I was pointing out the hypocracy of some women defending being obese	30
0	This was at Friendly's....not sure if that makes a difference	30
0	Did you forget a /s or are looking to get banned?	30
0	I feel you bro! I feel you!	30
0	The poor starving people would still be poor and starving even if they didn't eat as much...	30
0	I don't shave my armpits regularly and no one would ever know in real life. I wear shirts with sleeves and never tank tops. When I have to wear a dress for a special occasion I will shave.   Hams like blue pit girl don't represent us normal people that don't publicly announce something as trivial as armpits.	30
0	50%? Above 30% is just revolting.	30
0	I wouldn't go so far as to say it makes me angry (plus, I'm Gemini, so that lasts 30 seconds until I get distracted by some other happy thing, lol), but I don't want to see it.  Grow your pubes a foot long, if you want, i don't care, but don't show it in polite society.  If you want to play jungle jane or feral femme, do it in the jungle; not in the urban metropolis. So, the lack of "sense of occasion", I guess.	30
0	Higher than 25% is gross.  I hold my fellow ladies to high standards.  It's no longer curvy and looks like too many beers and doughnuts.  No excuse.  Edit:Looks like there are more 24.9 BMI women in here than I thought.	30
0	That's her dining room	30
0	I hardly see a fat cunts in Sweden, and Denmark, but in Finland you come across every now and then. Never been to Norway tho. But in America, she could be a model.	30
0	&gt; I tied my shoes and ran 8.3 miles, burning off most of the excess calories I shoved down my gullet the night before.  If you're a troll, congratulations.  If you are serious, please stop your stupid fatlogic. Please remove the idea that working out is 'burning off the fat' or that exercise 'keeps the fat off'.  The only people I know that think that way are overweight and veering very dangerously into obesity.   This thinking is stupid.  To reiterate: No amount of exercise is going to do jack for your weight management endeavors. Again, this thinking is stupid.	30
0	We need some socialism cause when we all obviously and directly suffer from the butternauts size then we will be forced to do something about it	30
0	Heh, heh, swamp donkey.	30
0	Nothing.   Edit: fatpeoplehate thought what was originally here was offensive. So nothing is here now to protect the feelings of those who are what this was.	30
0	I haven't watched it but they were probably talking calorie vs Calorie. One of the two us actually a kilo calorie also called the dietary calorie thus ignorant fucks could be like durr calorie isn't Calorie dur da dur	30
0	Better NSFW tag that, man!	30
0	Delusion and denial levels are way too positive.	30
0	haha I bet it is!!  That fat fucker is trying to pull one over on us!	30
0	Damn. If she'd lost weight instead of gained it she could have been hot.	30
0	Haha mine is when he gets his slutty little anus pounded like fat whore in a dumpster	30
0	&gt; has become Fox News North  Are you fucking serious? It has been the liberal parties publicly funded mouth piece since at least 2007. All they talk about is how the wonderful opposition parties will 'fix everything', emotional BS/feelings and stuff that no one except people living in the Republic of Toronto give a flying fuck about.	30
0	Just shut the fuck up all of you	30
0	Yeah, not true at all for everyone.  I made numerous diet changes. Only medication ever helped	30
0	Interesting how a BF% of 30 is considered obese... Then you see 35% and it all makes sense	30
0	Oh man if that counts I really prayed that something like this happened.	30
0	The worst part about this fucker is that he was about my height (5'8"), but he sounded legitimately like he was about 4 or 5 years younger than me (so about 13-14). Even lifting bags made him grunt and whine like a pig. Fucking hell.	30
0	This is /r/fatpeoplehate, not feminist hate. Take your redpill shit elsewhere.	30
0	Fat Greasy Hambeast! It must smell awful! Who the fuck would find that thing sexy?	30
0	America is a glutton in many ways, this picture is symbolic.	30
0	I totally agree. Makes it even more frustrating.	30
0	It's not satire, it is trolling	30
0	Oh my...I don't even want to imagine how they did it...	30
0	How is this fat logic?	30
0	Uber does not see the destinations until you physically type it in. Half the time I just hop in and say "airport, please" and they will take care of it.  And they do not see what the fare is. What you see before the ride is an estimate based on distance and probable time. Final fare is not settled until you're our of the car.   Rides are not chosen by anything other than you being available and also close to the pickup location.  Your comment is all wrong.	30
0	this blog post was more hard hitting to me than any other FPH post here combined. You could really show people why you are against obesity if you properly present ourselves and your arguments.       Maybe I'll join FPH if this is what it becomes. I like your message, but your motivations and execution are not the best.      Peace!	30
0	I wondered why someone had the flag of the German Empire for a second.	30
0	Holy fuck you guys are terrible. Yes, she is obviously in very poor health and needs to work harder to stay healthy. Can't you guys hate their lifestyle, not them? I just can't imagine what kind of issues someone needs to have to call someone(yes, even someone who has made bad decisions) an "it".   Of course now I am going to get called fat. Just ban me already.	30
0	When is the baby due?	30
0	I'm not your buddy, pal. But seriously idk why I'm getting downvoted. Look in the post histories of the account. It has made 4 accounts just to get them banned in the sub. The thing appears to be saying it really is 410 pounds and is doing reverse satire where it attempts to make fun of our satire in some weird ass backwards way. Just goes to show how much the IQ suffers from the burden of McGrease flowing through its brain. Edit: it literally has been banned 3 times this thread alone	30
0	I'm the same way with apples and bananas.	30
0	This should be on /r/facepalm	30
0	Because everybody should have the same opinion as you, right? Get off your high horse dude.	30
0	Never said it was exclusive to me. I bet a lot of people are turned off this sub by the hostility.  you could get an even bigger following if you appeal to that crowd. I'm not being selfish- If you *really* wanna help eliminate obesity, you'd branch out to everyone, not just your own same circle that already have got the message.	30
0	We want to appeal to thin people only. And we're not going to change our message to cater just so we can have more followers. We have 100,000 subscribers, and at least half of them must be overweight lurkers.   We don't need anyone's approval.	30
0	Didn't know 110lbs is overweight.        i'm not saying stop hating obese people, do your thing, it is fat people *hate* after all- But a lot of this sub try to justify their actions by saying "it's for the greater good of the public", "we're trying to tackle the obesity epidemic", etc etc. either do it right or stop trying to excuse yourselves.	30
0	Please. It's a funny picture, but America still has the best looking women by far.  For every hamplanet you show me from America, I'll show you some dentist-deprived, mangled-mouth European.	30
0	Since I'm not legally an adult, my BMI is calculated by the percentile- 67th percentile	30
0	Oops. Well, it's a great opportunity for the adipose blobs to call us neo-nazis :)	30
0	No were not you dumb motherfucker. Have fun with your ban. Cry into some Ben &amp; Jerrys	30
0	So what? It's not like you have become thinner since then.	30
0	What rule 2 all I saw was a link to a rule about no fat sympathy.	30
0	Exactly so not all tribes ran after their prey.  Some fished, farmed, whatever.  Why is it so extreme.  Fatass on the couch or marathon.	30
0	They sometimes delete images from FPH.	30
0	Is that thing African?	30
0	Wow! Obviously this was about fatty! /s	30
0	TIL: I should move to a country in Asia.	30
0	See? This is why I like dogs more than people.	30
0	Fuck the rules, I'm emigrating to /r/anarchyfatpeoplehate	30
0	Why is it orange? Does it bathe in cheetos? Thought Norway/Sweden was a shitlord country? I'd love to live in Norway myself but stuck here in Murica home of the obeasts.	30
0	You and /u/duck_dogers still aren't understanding me.   I'm not denying the fact that couples like this exist and is a stereotype of African Americans.  I know you aren't surprised by the couple in my post, I didn't post them to surprise anyone. Obviously this kind of couple exists and obviously they aren't unique. I still find it gross, so I decided to post them on a forum that is meant to be a place to ridicule and marvel at fat fats.	30
0	Damnit, I had something for this, but nope, I forget what it was as soon as I touched my keyboard.	30
0	Yeah, unless you can provide any evidence for a decrease, I'm safely going to assume you're still one of the fattest countries in the world. :) And no, just because you don't like this fact, doesn't mean it's a circlejerk. :)	30

0	This makes me sad as an American. It doesn't matter how much money and power we have. What's the point if the all the other countries have hotter women.	30
0	Agreed, although i think 35% is still way to fat. Somebody should report OP for seemingly accepting obviously fat people...	30
0	Why is there a black dick running across the top?	30
0	I have the reddit Pics HD on my iPad. Is it possible to get rid of this sub? Thanks	30
0	In comparison, she looked absolutely disgusting. It's like night and day.	30
0	Yeah, the American is the fattest ham, but they all look like they could stand to hit the gym. I guess where the U.S. Goes, the rest of the world follows, eventually.	30
0	Yes, I dip and chew tobacco. I won't lie and I'm not ashamed of it. But at least I take care of the rest of my body and I'd say you're at a greater risk if you're morbidly obese and most of all its just absolutely fucking disgusting. I know the risks of what I do but at least I'm not claiming it's healthier for me like these hamplanets that are part of the HEAS movement	30
0	Hey, PsychoticMouse, this is you- https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/556904575178145792/dvCCDPeY.jpeg  Should you really be making fun of people's physical appearance? You're hiding hamplanet tits under those oversized clothes.  Also, nice Pokemon shirt. You are in your 20's, in a dingy, dark room, looking lonely (with a child's party hat, did nobody else show up?). Dude, spend less time modding here and get your size right, you slovenly, balding young man.	30
0	So glad to be a not disgusting, skinny fit american.	30
0	I'm super tall with fairly broad shoulders. Still normal weight.	30
0	Uh, I would had I not spotted that foot. It wouldn't be the first time an overweight person was verified. (I can think of only one other time, to be fair)	30
0	Hey one of my physical goals is to become obese.	30
0	And you know they're bragging about being able to wear their pre-baby clothes	30
0	Why anyone cares about virtual feelings I don't know. Pretty funny fatpeoplehate is telling me not to stereotype	30
0	Same here, Olympia mode underway	30
0	The sad thing is I'm sure she'd be attractive if she were normal sized :(	30
0	Marilyn Monroe had plastic surgery	30
0	Anorexia and bulimia is a choice. Like overeating	30
0	How big are her bones?	30
0	This picture is so accurate. Every time I travel, whether alone or with friends/colleagues, people are surprised that we're American because a) we're not fat and b) we speak languages other than English. It makes me wonder wtf is wrong with so many Americans as to make us physically and intellectually inferior.	30
0	I love my thigh gap! My legs look so good :P	30
0	No offense, but that's twice the amount of sugar the WHO recommends you eat in an entire day.	30
0	Man she looked amazing before. Great now too but in a different way.	30

0	Notice how they barely have enough space to put the flags on the backs of the other girls but Miss USA had flab to spare.	30
0	Hey man, we're here to make fun of the fats, not others.  Also, I notice you are a non-verified user making comments about a verified  not fat user.	30
0	just looking at her arms in the first set of pictures, I could see the fat potential...	30
0	Both sides are wrong. They should change the name and the family should eat less.	30
0	Oh, I thought I was in fatlogic because I was in /r/front. Looks like I'm out of here.	30
0	This is a little misleading only because the 10-12% seems to have way more muscle. Lower bf% =/= more muscle. I'm at ~1% with wayyy to little muscle.	30
0	Straight up tell her if she doesn't change her habits your going to leave her. Start doing more things by yourself and make some new lady friends. She will change and if she doesn't then she's not someone you want anyway.  I know about 99% of Reddit hates them but go to /r/asktrp and see what they think. They have the same mentality that we do when it comes to fats.	30
0	Spoken like a first class white knight. I think she'll survive someone saying they have different tastes in women.	30
0	I just want to state for the record how fucking much I fucking hate stoners.	30
0	I don't think you get the concept of "polite society" or maybe we're not talking about the same thing.  Sounds like an SJW thing to say, "hey, if women have it this way, men should have it this way too..." yadayada. Whether you're male or female or some other gender, grow your pit hair, if that's what rocks your boat.  I just stated my preference that I am predisposed to not liking seeing it on women.	30
0	Benned for fat sympathy.	30
0	I would have gone with "biggest" in the set up, heavy doesn't sound quite right for those two.	30
0	I don't do Instagram. My first introduction to it was wondering why teenagers with smartphones that could take amazingly clear, pristine pictures, would want to run it through a filter and make it look like a blurry, shitty Polaroid from the 1970's....all my baby pics are like that!   Anywho.....the hashtags on Instagram, crack me up....curvy yoga ..... Hee hee hee	30
0	That fucking cobweb tit tho. Ugh.	30
0	Why is everyone downvoting this guy? He hasn't broken any rules. If you disagree with the sources he put and his argument, pull up contrary sources for a counter argument.	30
0	Is that a scooter pulled up to the table?!?!?!?!	30
0	And if each box of Reese is 7$, that means most fatties even if they want to can't afford those 30 boxes.	30
0	And sprinkle some creole sasoning!	30
0	How is a bag going to help in this situation? It isn't going to magically grow my dick another 6" to be able to reach past the fat flaps... It isn't going to allow me to maintain an erection long enough to ejaculate.   Alright. /r/eyebleach needs us all right now.	30
0	Usually it's because they want to take selfies to make it seem like they have a life. Then they want to try their hardest to get attention, then they don't. Ugh and dancing, those nasty ass rolls gross us all out. Eww. Gonna go work out now. Then have some veggies and fruits.	30
0	&gt; the corrupt food industry  The food industry is hardly corrupt. They provide a service, and people use that service. Hardly corrupt but more like basic as fuck economics. Besides, they sponsor a insane amount of sports (how many Coca-Cola logos do you see during sporting events for example). This is like blaming the alcohol industry for drinking and driving. Not their fucking problem that people cannot control themselves with their products.	30
0	good to know a UK fat is still a USA fat though... hehe	30
0	I remember that too and her boyfriend was just like getting so frustrated with her. I hope her baby isn't born fat, she's setting it up for a bad life straight from the womb	30
0	I don't understand funnel cakes.  I tried to eat some of it at a fair a while ago and nearly threw up.  Its literally a pile of grease.	30
0	She doesn't have type two diabetes yet, so she needs to stay low so she doesn't develope it. I'm not sure the whole story but she's not being responsible with her baby's life	30

0	My girlfriend just taught me about this actually. Its that girls prefer a "dadbod" to a guy who is super super ripped. It says nothing about girls finding in-shape guys attractive. But that females look for partners who would be good parents for their kids, so we look to our parents for guides on how to find that mate and what they should look like.   Its no excuse for dudes to just become fatshits or start Supersizing at McDonalds though.	30
0	Fit women are gorgeous. FTFY	30
0	Hahahaha! This is a friend of mine. Just tagged her in the comments to see how she responds to this.	30
0	If we're using that picture as an example, anything above 30% can go into a hole and die. Could care less. Even that girl at 30% would need to lack cellulite for my dick to go in there. I'd rather stick my dick in a garbage disposal, which is about the equivalent of these fat asses and the shit they devour.	30
0	All fat person transport vehicles are scootypuffs to me. Even fold out wheelchairs.  Edit: I'd also like to add a fat person is a fat person. I have no sympathy for them, no matter how old and disabled they are.	30
0	If you can get her out in public, start making comments like "She's pretty" when you see a fitgirl wearing yoga pants etc, especially if you can spot one that has the bodytype your girl used to	30
0	I'll gladly do this, you fat jealous turd. Nothing turns me on more than a jealous rage.   Rules: you must also post. With your /u/ and the date. I will do the same.   Game on, b word.   [Oh](http://imgur.com/a/o6Ec5), are we not [playing](http://imgur.com/a/lqmw9) anymore? :-(	30

0	That's the thing though, chocolate is just the start. Everything that's not been officially approved or "key-holed" as we call it is going to increase significantly in price. When literally every unhealthy item in the store is 3 times the price of the healthy stuff then a bell has to start ringing in some fat guys head.	30
0	She's not even fat, shes barely on the chubby scale. Admittedly, i have no idea who this was and googled her but i took a long hard look and she seems to be at a healthy weight. Can anybody provide any evidence to prove me wrong?	30

0	1.)  Infant Mortality decreased because of Medicine.  You think that just happened by chance?  Sanitation ala Pasteurization is also considered a Modern marvel keeping us alive.  2.)  I am health nut.  I wanna live forever.  But apparently this sub is more concerned with "Gym Fit" bullshit.  "We can do whatever the fuck we want as long as it does not kill us off"  Exactly.  I will wait until we have heart replacements until I do something that has evidence for hurting your heart.  Sprinting on the other hand is better for you in almost every single way.	30

0	They're not saying his body is too thin, rather they are talking about how his face appears gaunt now.      Edit: Y'all are dumb. Why would a makeup artist display his shirtless body when making makeup tutorials? They are talking about his leaner face and his clothed upper torso.	30
0	I saw a gif one time of a different mushroom-like obese woman walking to a toilet. She needed a special ultra wide seat just to shit.	30
0	The real tragedy is that if she wasn't such a hamster, she'd probably be quite attractive.	30

0	Oh yes, very good one. Also reminds me of Robert Sheehan's excellent pic 'n mix performance on Misfits.	30

0	Too bad all of the girls are American (it's an American study abroad program) and if that's the ratio of unhealthy people to healthy people, I'd say that's not embarrassing; it's above average.	30

0	What is fit though? I weigh 410 lbs *and losing* and I have been working out for quite some time now, I'm even starting to see some abs and triceps! I consider myself fit as I am sure all you guys here would do too (I go to the gym once a month!) but the HAES-activists definitely wouldn't. They're a toxic bunch! So whilst you guys definitely would enjoy my naked body in public, the HAES-activist would hate it.   "Being fit" is really subjective.	30
0	&gt; Well, it's pretty entertaining that you have nothing better to do with your life **than post pictures of fatties  on reddit**.  #Hamplanetlogic right there!	30
0	Well, I'm actually pretty strong so no delusions here! I've won a couple of arm wrestling contests as I've said before, hehe!	30
0	Omg I wish I could give you a hug, a really big hug. Thank you for taking the time out to post this, and stand up for yourself and the other shitlords here who have gone through similar. it's nothing but the truth what you said. I would never give this advice 6 months ago not seeing for myself - But things (depression, anxiety, blah blah blah) do get better, they will for you, for sure. Keep up the good work. Youre fucking awesome, op!	30
0	Exactly. She's clearly advertising herself as a whore.	30
0	I'm not necessarily losing weight though, I'm just *transforming* the fat into muscle texture by going to the gym once a month for an entire hour or so. I guess one might say that I have a bodybuilder body.	30
0	Are you people kidding me. So not eating or purging is okay because it's a mental illness. Great. Don't be surprised if fat people use the same excuse. Neither is healthy. Stop making making excuses for weak people because you are starting to sound like HAES.	30
0	Why are you intervening in our conversation? /u/leelem0n and I are flirting, there's no need to be jealous!   How do I verify and how can I be sure that /u/leelem0n gets to see my verification picture - it will be a naked one! ;)	30

0	This is why starving children in developing country all look so fat. It's their genetics.	30
0	Dead kids is too far man.	30
0	Maybe I should have said "normal." Or "human" would have worked.	30
0	So a single person replying to multiple people on a thread in order to give his comment visibility because nobody knows what the picture is actually from and because he was 10 hours late to said thread, somehow shows how "fucked up the states is" and also shows that I'm fat? Again; nice life, I feel sorry for you. I wouldn't be surprised if you were Australian. Also, why would a fat person try to defend the U.S. for not being fat? That doesn't make sense at all, but again, I'm not surprised because logic is something you obviously lack.	30
0	So you are one of those skinny acne fuckfaces. There is a secret Rx for acne your own doctor will never tell you. You squeeze that puss out of your face craters and you eat it. Yeah, eat it. Then the GI immune IgA response creates immunity to propionibacterium. Problem solved. No bacteria, no acne. Or you can suck on your gf's zits. BTW, do I seem like I give a shit? Beat it.	30
0	No, they don't. Otherwise, they wouldn't be fat in the first place.	30

0	So... What's wrong with him? I can't be the only one who feels this is a bit of a fucked up thing to spit out at the open media. Maybe I'm not familiar enough with rappers.	30
0	Whoa, how is that sub a thing...? How is that even legal?	30
0	It's banned! You're just as illiterate as /u/AADworkinShitlordAlt who's jealous of what I and /u/leelem0n have.	30

0	Nope, they guy is a ham himself. You can tell by the arms - no separation, no vascularity.	30
0	hiya,  not sure if you care but the spelling you were looking for was affect; the difference between the two spellings is somewhat interesting as they each have different ways they can be used   effect can also be used as a verb but everyone knows it doesn't work for fats	30
0	You must be fatty delusional if you think that I'm here to entertain any of you guys, keep the downvotes and banning coming!	30
0	Heterochromia is awesome, look at Mila Kunis and David Bowie, but being fat fuck is fucking unacceptable. Get that fat sympathy the fuck out of here.	30

0	Looks like quite a few people fell for my bait. Poor babies.	30
0	American size 0 is a uk 10 or 12 I believe.	30
0	Nope. UK sizes are only one smaller than American. A 12 is an American 10. Or something like that. I at least know it's not size 0	30
0	Why can't I just enjoy both subs?	30
0	As I said, I'm not familiar with any rappers at all. That clears things up a lot.	30
0	Honestly, I think its more for pregnant women, or people who want to hold babies in their laps. That large of a gap can let even humongously pregnant women get in and out without injury so IDK, I can deal with the inconvenience if it helps parents ¯\_(ツ)_/¯	30

0	Good name? Although there are no medical records (which I understand can make this seem unbelievable) her biographer claims she had over 12 abortions.   She was married three times; Not very christian by their standards. Scandal involving Kennedy. Died at a young age with a family history of depression and known addiction to pills. Yea. Good name she had.  Edit: everyone mad I ruined yalls opinion of this slut? First paragraph is taken with a teaspoon of salt but the second paragraph is all fact. She is a horrible person for any woman to idolize. I even think she was fugly.	30

0	Li'l Ceaser's fye dolla hot 'n ready y'all!!	30
0	Lots of fatties have in their heads that eating healthy food is the only way to lose weight, so they eat it. And eat it. And keep on eating it. Instead of eating less, they just eat the same amount in healthy food. It's a really bizarre way of thinking.	30
0	You and 15 others are the real idiots here for speaking up whilst not following what's been going on, especially when it's right under your noise!   /u/leelem0n &lt;3	30
0	I know what you mean here, but from my experience I don't think they are actually laying booths out for hambeast comfort. I think it's just shitty design/architecture.	30
0	This is obviously a kid	30
0	Banned because you don't know how to read.	30
0	I came to say this.  I'm 6'4'' and my roommate is 6'6'' I like leg room.  These two are kids, wait til they grow up.  They look 12.	30
0	While most of the time it is due to poor diet and lack of activity, there are some people who are naturally overweight despite living healthy. Being fat due to genetics is an overused excuse, but it is a real thing.	30
0	How is that clear?	30
0	Could eat anything through a fence.... By the looks of it has on many occasions.	30
0	Because she isn't actually fat.  That's not overweight.  It isn't even TOOOO borderline, I believe.  You can be not overweight and still not be an athlete.  She's still below average.	30
0	It's not totally unrealistic?	30
0	I cry when I see these.	30
0	Absolutes are for idiots.	30
0	wow. I think she's hot. Funny. She takes no pride in her appearance yet she is a super model with millions she has made just by being hot. Yet you meatheads spend your life in a gym and have nothing to show for it.  I'm fit by the way.	30

0	Why were half of this sub posters bullied in school?	30
0	There is, just after N.	30
0	Swept her off her hooves! Ha amazing!	30
0	I mean technically it is a curve too. It's just possible to have too many curves.  Edit: Haha, never received so many downvotes before, but I ain't even mad. I thought I was being clearly anti-fat, though; it just kind of cracks me up when fat women talk about being curvy when, unlike the perfectly proportioned women in FA cartoons, they've all got way more "curves" than any normal woman.	30

0	Hmm, I'm not a yellow person myself.	30
0	But guys the dad body is so hot! This guy obviously reached ultimate dad mode. He just lost his breath doing normal thugs because he has more important priorities than spending all day in the gym.	30
0	Is that brain fat? She's so fat that there is fat in and around her brain...	30
0	Please tell me this is not in the Deep South...I see shit like this everyday when I go out.	30
0	Nothing in that post said anything about the ridicule of hate mongers being his reason for change. He disliked his body and attempted suicide which gave him a new perspective on life.	30
0	He wasn't disrespecting anybody it seems, just pointing out the obvious.	30
0	You have to take into account that Linux has grown tremendously since 1999 and fat acceptance wasn't a big thing back then either, so people may have lied about their shirt size.	30
0	So eating way too much and hating on people is different than when they don't eat enough?  They can both be mental illnesses, but at the end up the day it IS easy to rectify.    Obeasts are in the same boat as anorexics in that their food intake has a huge correlation with their feelings.  I don't get how you can be on a sub that hate's fat people then defend the people doing the same thing but on the other side of the spectrum.	30
0	I'm really struggling to see what point you're making.	30
0	You are sooo welcome!! &lt;3 (hamantha is a great example of why I love this sub, this is great hahah)	30
0	Damn. I'd say you are lucky to have escaped with your life after taking that picture. I'd be concerned about concealed weapons. Lots of folds to hide them you know.	30
0	What kind of cancer is that on her head?  Did these people just return from a binge fest at a radiation site?	30
0	Looks like like a fucking mind tumour	30
0	(TIL) Ah, got it!! Hope you are well! :)	30
0	Temptation isn't a rational function. Giving into it often almost always means you're doing something self destructive. And the less you give in, the less you ever want to. Problem is fatties see self-control as deprivation. It's hilarious because I don't think fats ever feel deprived. They take what the want no matter what, they always throw tantrums when they can't get their way.	30
0	They look like big fat babies. You know because babies are so little and pudgy and sometimes have arm or leg rolls on their little bodies. That's the only time you can be more fat than muscle. These whales literally look like big fat babies.	30
0	You are welcome to your beliefs, but it's how you express them that dictates if others want to play with you.  It's not so much to anti-fat sentiment, but the "hate" sentiment. FPH isn't about helping people lose weight, it is about belittling people.	30

0	Same here. I've NEVER seen someone this big here in the netherlands.	30
0	Getting attention sure, it's causing overweight people to dig deeper into the fat acceptance movement.   It's like when a militant atheist and an evangelical Christian get into an argument. No one changed their mind, they just dig deeper into their own assumptions.	30
0	Yes, elephants belong there too, so what's the difference.	30
0	No GPS but it's really generous in calories burned it says I've burned 500 calories and I haven't done anything other than sleep and walk to the bathroom.  But it's not your eating back calories if that makes any sense. I don't use it for the calories I just like knowing my steps and heart rate because I'm weird. I can type a real explanation when I get to the computer	30
0	Being stick thin is quite nice, actually.	30
0	It's not what you eat it's *how much* of what you eat. You can't get it through their thick heads!	30

0	You need to see a psychologist then. It's not normal to find fatties more attractive then attractive women. I hope you get well soon, degenerate.	30
0	Genetics is not going to push your BMI over 25, being lazy with no self control does.  Goodbye.	30
0	BMI isn't always accurate. You can tell by looking at her that she's fat. I don't care what the BMI says.	30
0	That's not the first or last time I'm gonna hear that in my life and it certainly doesn't hurt my feelings.	30
0	Hm you do make a good point.	30
0	&gt; for me, is not about hating fat people   This reads like a sympathy post.   This post belongs at r/SaveTheWhales	30
0	15-17 is perfect. 10-12 is nasty and 30 and above are also nasty.	30
0	But she isn't a fattie. I thought this subreddit was intended for those that are fatties. You know, the ones that claim it's not their fault or it's because of their genes, etc.	30
0	I pity that towel .	30
0	I don't get it, did they eat the baby?  http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/24735764.jpg	30
0	I didn't mean to be offensive, but I can see a lot of posts about being bullied in high school by fat lards, I find it weird.	30
0	I'm 5'4 weight 110 lbs, with a 34in bust, 27in waist and 34in hips. I go through the users of this sub occasionally, see them posting to other subs, and then get the mods of those subs to ban you. It's not about other people ignoring health advice, it's about yall being dicks.	30
0	Was gonna say the same thing	30
0	It's so sad. She looks like she could actually be decent looking if she wasn't such a lard ass.	30
0	What part don't you believe?	30
0	Newsflash: 15.8 @ 84 mph is not fast!  Also aren't Brides some of the cheapest shitty seats you can buy?	30
0	what in the fuck.. .you can't call them stewardess' now??   wtf is wrong with 2015	30
0	Alright, does that need to be while holding a piece of paper with my username? It's not like I need the confirmation but I do like it that when I tell a story I won't have to expect these type of comments.	30
0	Looks like bigger, larger version of Donald Trump.	30
0	I see the resemblance https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/505660641303330817/MDFG3IQf_400x400.jpeg	30
0	He shot it while sitting the jeep and the driver ran it down	30
0	Yes. She is not fat. Doesn't have enough fat to make me hate her by any means.	30
0	According to the given empirical evidence, I do not see anything wrong with her. She has a little more fat than some, yes, but so what? We're all entitled to our own opinion. Thank you for explaining this subreddit to me though. I had no idea it was about hating fat people.	30
0	&gt; It's not a myth, it actually happens. Even in the United States there are enclosed farms that you can just go to and shoot whatever you want, and it has no chance of getting away.   That is so sad, sick and evil.    &gt; Even pro-hunting people shake their heads at this lard.   That does not surprise me. Even hired killers and serial killers have their standards. That lard-mounts don't is revolting but I suppose that if there are enough of them and if they are individually rich enough *someone* will feed the market.	30
0	She's excercising to lose weight... Isn't that what you want? She realized your mentality was correct and she should lose weight and is working out to stop being fat. Why would you have a problem with that? Do you also hate welfare recipients that get a job or drug addicts that get clean?	30
0	Aw I read the requirements but I don't meet them yet as I didn't comment every day of the week :(	30
0	I'm pretty numb to fat fuckers after reading this sub for a while now. But this shit right here made me laugh out loud. This has Mississippi written all over it	30
0	How would that work though? You can only check in one ticket st the end and most airlines overbook their flights. So if you buy two tickets it doesn't change anything.	30
0	Yeah but I can only get verified after commenting for a week straight. Which I haven't done yet. I took the pic with my username and then I wanted to message the mods but I read the requirements first and I don't meet them yet.	30
0	&gt;In nugget form, preferably.  :D	30
0	Idiocracy is a real prophecy.	30
0	I'm surprised he fit in the frame with her.	30
0	Might be [Vitiligo?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo)	30
0	&gt; sausage and egg McMuffins  That was the only thing I still got from there until they raised the price to over $4 for one.  Now McDs is dead to me.  Kids still get nuggets once in a while, but I don't eat anything from there anymore.	30
0	Got a feeling you sit down when you pee.	30
0	This isn't all of our girls, trust me US chick fucking look good. Just not the overweight 40% Don't worry about that 40% they shouldn't be around much longer. heh	30
0	Gah! what is wrong with her face and the part of the scalp where hair used to be?	30
0	Lol, wut? I'm smart enough to know there are a ton of fatties masquerading as shitlords and that makes me feminine?   And from an unverified user, no less.   Sack up and show your guns if you are what you say you are, fat boy.	30
0	Yep. Personally, I don't think his music is that great.	30
0	No. And you shouldn't make assumptions when you don't know anything about me or what my school was like. It's possible to not bully people even if you're not being bullied.	30
0	Haha same, my dad has a 6-pack and is the fittest in his office, so...	30
0	Just saying that table looks like you can move it.	30
0	You.... do not get the point of FPH.	30
0	Maybe the fat in their eyelids are preventing them from reading the rules?	30
0	you should trim them nails	30
0	Glad you are doing something about it but you aren't allowed in here.	30
0	And not a pretty one if I believe this pic! /s  ;-)	30

0	Anyone else feel bad for the apartment and the weight it has to bare? Don't even get me started on that poor toilet.	30
0	I don't remember claiming it doesn't exist. I just said I never saw it at my school.  I'm a very asocial person and I rarely interact with others. I'm not the type of person who would bully someone. Maybe I just didn't see it because I was not around when it happened. All I know is that I never saw it.	30
0	If doesn't matter if she waived her arm back and forth or walked straight up everest, the calorie count is off. The Fitbit doesn't fucking measure actual calories burned, it's just a function of the steps and duration.

Yup I'm a classic fatty, I wear a bow tie and suspenders to hold up my sweat pants	30

(Not to brag just giving you an idea that I'm not some lard-ass). But srsly, 1700 calories isn't enough to live on. I'm doing about 1.5-2k a meal and I eat 4 times a day.	30

0	Yeah me too, these people are just sadly retarded and would love to be gassed in a german concentration camp.	30
0	Good on her. You're probably a sad concentration camp loving anne frank looking muthafucka. You look like a mushroom tip.	30
0	Apparently your father didn't teach you about reading the sidebar. Gtfo, fatty.	30
0	Better than this shitty retarded sub. You guys probably don't have a clue about star wars yet you post jabba the hut. Fucking clown jew muthafuckas.	30
0	Then discuss it somewhere else. From the amount of downvotes your post is getting, I don't think people here really want to talk about it.	30

0	Is netball what whales they call it when they have to free themselves from the fishermen's nets?	30
0	Well this (Hate on Women) happens amongst MANY subreddits. Why dont you go fight their cause, and leave a stated 'Hate' group like the KKK alone.  We're not changing our minds, they've been changed in the 30 years I've seen niggers on wellfare while my 85 year old grandmother works.  We;re not 'removing' the visual records we have of coons posing their young children to become thugs themselves....I cannot unsee that kind of child abuse.  We're not getting over the audacious costs involved in 'helping' a 5 time felon junglemonkey spending welfare on drugs.	30

0	Back in the day Marilyn Monroe was about a size 14, which translates roughly into a current size 4. Meaning that the industry has been making bigger clothes with smaller size tags so people will feel thin and buy their stuff. My mum's wedding dress is a 38, and she wears about a 38 today but she does not have the same measurements she used to have and her wedding dress doesn't quite fit her anymore...

0	Actually, I remember when I was sick, just eating a sandwich felt like the most difficult thing in the world all of a sudden. Iirc, I didn't even manage to finish it even though it was delicious and I was hungry.  To be fair though, even walking at a normal pace was basically impossible then. And I was on liquid only food for a while (not sure if that has any effect on eating ability, but that's how I stayed alive if you were wondering).  But yeah, I have no point, I obviously agree with you. Your comment just reminded me of how surprised I was.	30

0	Big tits? I don't see how hams even can call those tits......your description is spot on!  Plus the way I view boobs is: Anything bigger then a mouth full is a waste.	30
0	When you talk about losing weight yourself on here without verifying, people will assume you're still fat and a mod might ask you to verify so you don't get banned. Rules have just gotten stricter so people get banned more quickly.	30
0	I hear ya on this one!  I went through a year and half of weight loss, then spent a lot of money and pain to get an hourglass (damn loose skin).  Now that I truly have an hourglass figure (38 - 32 - 39) I don't want to admit it to anyone who isn't able to see me.	30
0	What in the fuck?	30
0	I see posts like this, and I only think, Why are you giving these fatties the validation of a right swipe?   I couldn't let a fat girl think even for a second that someone else found her attractive.	30
0	You're better than me because of your *parents* accomplishments? Way to piggyback on their success you fat, lazy, entitled little turd basket.  Why don't you go out and make something of *yourself*.  Banned.	30

0	This is why kimchi eaters are always so slim.	30
0	I don't ever regulate my diet, lived for a solid year on no beverages but mountain dew, and eat junk food pretty consistently. But I also maintain my body figure to an incredible muscular one, and work out almost daily to stay as skinny and fit as I am. You can eat what you want you just have to make sure that you're outputting at least that much. That's why I just can't understand why people don't just MOVE. I've never been to a gym in my life get up and do literally anything.	30
0	Fatty and what looks like someone who is missing a portion of their lower jaw bone.	30
0	I think you would be surprised.  When a girl is offered 3 months pay for a single night, it can be very enticing for them.  I would never pay, because I don't need to.  However, I don't really see anything wrong with those who do.  If two people are consenting, then it's fine in my book.  It's just not my cup of tea.  Regardless, why be wealthy and fat when you can be wealthy and fit.	30
0	Damn. Goes to show you that even a gym can't fix that face though.	30
0	Last four on the right, no thanks	30

0	Great source. Only thing is BMI over 25 is considered overweight, 30 obese.    Edit: I would like to thank the downvote brigade downvoting all my comments like it fucking matters...  Must of triggered someone between the last 5 or so comments I made. Keep on truckin, hammy. :)	30

0	My point isn't that they aren't "real" feminists but that blanketing all feminists as SJWs is discrediting a lot of the other feminists. And it's a really cheap and convenient way to just ignore someone.	30

0	In 6 hours at my job on a busy day I can hit 10,000 steps easy. And in no way is that tiring. Another 7,000 steps would be nothing. That would be 2 hours at the zoo (which I just did this weekend LOL!)	30
0	Never thought I'd say this, but that shit needs a FUPA cover	30
0	Her BMR is probably 2200 cal, and according to my FitBit when I walk 10,000 steps I burn 1000 calories (putting my TDEE at 2500) so if the butter sucker did walk that many steps her calories out would be over 3000. But she didn't.	30
0	I hope i dont get much hate for this but here it goes. I share the r/fatpeoplehate ideology, even though I'm 30 lbs over the ideal bmi scale.   I think I'm addicted to food, it dreads me that I may have to give up going out with friends and eating in our favorite joints to get healthier (which I definitely need).   Halp?	30

0	At least she has done the descant thing and covered up.	30
0	Ah, that would explain it. I thought the calories are just the steps, not BMR added to it	30
0	Not that big is still big, though. She may not be a planet but you can count on the fact that she'll be one within 2 years. I see no defined collar bone and a mushy tum.	30
0	theres a reason this post only has 13 upvotes lol because he is barely fat and you have to pass a series of health tests to become an officer therefore this man has a pass, if this was a fat whale in public eating food then this would be justified	30
0	Lol what? 95 calories in 1 one ounce Apple. 16 ounces in a pound. Thats a 1520 calorie meal right there.	30
0	Let's not miss the third from the left.   edit: I am getting downvotes. I don't usually get an influx of downvotes, which makes me believe the people in this sub are responsible. If you're downvoting me, you need to reevaluate what you're doing here. That chick is overweight. Look at her waist. Unfortunately, we have been infiltrated by a bunch of overweight people who think they are average or fit, and seem to think that chick is of a healthy bmi. You pig fuckers disgust me.	30
0	I doubt a bug would want to suck on that, if fat person dies they don't decompose because even bacteria are grossed out	30
0	Fuck men. All men.	30
0	Chick on the left is bangin. White men are trash	30
0	That shit (both pictures) is just fucking ghastly. Living one's life with horrific surgical scars is the end result of being a RECOVERING hamplanet is just staggering . A wrecked, wickedly ugly body seems to be the end result. Faced with a choice of remaining fat, or living with three times the amount of flesh needed to cover a normal body, or getting the surgery to remove it I would.....just go ahead and kill myself	30
0	This is my favorite trope on fph.	30
0	And pigs can be trained to not shit in the house	30
0	The right way to do it, is putthing them in a cardboard tube and setting the top on fire so the rodents eat their way out the other end. Instant weight loss. Thank you, Shitlord Romans.	30
0	I can't believe that's a real thing now.	30
0	Get this bullshit off my front page	30
0	It does take more courage to do that than to be born with no arms and legs. The fatties are choosing to put themselves out there, the armless dude was just born that way.	30
0	Don't you think you're oversimplifying it? Hypothyroidism can cause weight gain, not just that you're eating too much.  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000353.htm	30
0	I want to see that!	30
0	Let's hope the kid has a brain and knows better.	30

0	Haha! This is great	30
0	I'm not, and it still shows up on my front page when I'm in /r/all.	30
0	Oh yes. So very much. Not saying it isn't better, just unfortunate.	30
0	Sorry I didn't know about rule #2... I just wanted some help and since this sub is always on r/all I thought I could ask that here?   Again sorry if I offended anybody I guess.	30
0	Sounds like you have a little something to compensate for.	30
0	Dude, lets be real here. They have probably been fat since they were kids. It isn't solely their fault.   You fucks need to get off your computer and read a damn book. You are pathetic.	30
0	Damn.  What a fucking waste.  Edit. Not trying to be sympathetic.  She needs to run and bad.	30

0	I just wanted to reinforce your 2nd point, having good skin is such a huge plus and not very hard to maintain for the average person.	30
0	Well Mr Defensive, not just Americans are fat. Aussies, Brits, Scots, Canadians - All export fat English speaking tourists.	30
0	What's your height and weight? If you're fat we really don't want you here until you're normal.	30
0	Depends, but a kilometre running will generally burn 2-3 times more calories than ~~running~~ riding iirc. Though that really depends on speed. Biking isn't a load bearing exercise, whilst running is.   EDIT: Running is not 3 times as efficient as running.	30
0	It matters if your heart rate is increasing or not. That's the key here. You can go to a aerobic chart and see what your heart rate should be based on age.   If you are getting in the "fat burning" zone, you are in the good.	30
0	Right of fat one.	30
0	There is real, actual gender discrimination in this line of work. They're notorious for ramping up the difficulty and/or adding superfluous tests to the process to intentionally flunk female applicants.   That being said, this probably isn't one of those cases, because they hired the chick anyway. No idea wtf happened here.	30
0	Where do you see such things?	30
0	Hey, those whales serve a purpose! All other asses look even more attractive with them around.	30

0	I won't discuss fasted cardio because I admit I don't know much about it, but having tea/coffee first thing in the morning WILL upset your stomach eventually.   There are several sources for this, and I can cite at least 3 if you want me to.	30

0	Now just imagine if he wasn't famous..	30
0	Holy shit the witch-hunt this subreddit is doing on you is far too real. Apparently being rational here is a bannable offense.   Pointing out- he didn't take the blame off of the people for being so fat, he's simply saying that they were dealt a mediocre hand to begin with- nothing comparable with the people up top, sure, but still a mediocre hand.    Then again this is a shitty circlejerk subreddit so I'm getting downvoted to hell regardless.	30
0	I counted at least 3 hams in that pic	30
0	I know what sub I'm in but she's TRYING to lose weight unlike the rest of the fat fucks on here.	30
0	looks like a fat terminator uh	30
0	I completely agree! There are many things you can do to make yourself more attractive. I am disgusted by people that do not take care of themselves, it is not that hard.	30
0	We are absolutely highly trained, most of us these days have a four year degree on top of what I mentioned. Did you have to do a straight month of 12-14 hour a day training with tests every day just to get your job? We got sent home if we didn't get an 80% on all of our 20 written exams and instantly if we didn't ace our 10 simulator exams. Kind of proved my point with that definition because that is the absolute bottom tier of our work day. We hand out drinks on our down time, but we are trained for much more than that.	30
0	I guess I'm just kind of confused why you guys hate fat people so much. It's also curious that this group is super defensive when there's different opinion.	30
0	Hey, this could be day #1 for this guy on his journey to lose 100lbs. I hope he doesn't quit on himself.	30
0	BTW I am impressed with no tramp stamps on any of them (unless I can't see it)	30
0	If this is true then congrats. Keep going strong my friend.	30
0	I would have just asked her if she'd rather be pissed off then pissed on?	30
0	It is. Cardio is better for you than lifting if you can only choose one (like if you're short on time). Intense biking burns a fuckload of calories, and it's not that hard to burn a solid 1000 calories in an hour on the bike (I've measured with my polar HR with correct height, weight, and VO2, before anyone comes in to tell me that the bike is inaccurate).	30
0	So had enough of the weird fat hatred on reddit. Sure, let's have a conversation about healthy eating and diet - but the irrational hatred present here reminds me of racists and anti-Semites. Someone is really going to get hurt.	30
0	Lol wow, had no idea this place was a cesspool. And no, I'm not fat thanks though guys. You should be proud of your community	30

0	No where near as bad fatty. Once her teen career is over she'll gain a bit.	30
0	This kind of criticism is mean. I agree that if a friend has an unhealthy lifestyle it's something you should talk to them about in a supportive way. There's probably a reason why they're being unhealthy and the most effective way to improve a situation is by understanding it. So you need to listen to them and be supportive.  Edit: to clarify I don't advocate unhealthy choices rather I advocate being supportive of people's positive qualities and finding/ bringing out/ celebrating the best in others, no matter your views on their choices. You don't have to be mean to influence someone, and IMO being nice is more effective anyway.	30
0	Holy fuck is the black death back? What's going on with the bulge?	30
0	Uhh. Is this sub supposedly satirical like the atheism and pcmasterrace one?  Edit: Alright, I admit the "atheism" one was misplaced, it isn't really satire and they don't have so many assholes. But I was still serious for the most part; I couldn't tell if you guys legitimately thought that fat people have no redeeming qualities whatsoever.	30
0	Wait, the guy who doesn't understand capitalization or proper grammar is correcting me?   lmao	30
0	This is scarier than any Frankenstein monster I've seen.	30
0	Fair enough, I guess it depends on a number of things, but riding flat or dow hill is just about always easier than running.	30
0	"I hope there won't come a day when all of us but a few are spectators. . ." - how prophetic!  It is so sad to see what the US used to be and what it is now.	30
0	Or pink and sweaty.	30
0	For sure, they ate an additional 2k calories for lunch to make up for the 300 they burned. Not to mention the sports drinks and gels they consumed during their stage of the Tour De France (another 800 or so calories.)	30
0	I just don't want people to be assholes for no reason. As you see from the comments I'm getting everyone here is clearly just a sad, bitter (probably self-hating) douchebags.	30
0	I'd kill myself.	30
0	that's exactly how some people feel about black/poor people. Doesn't make it okay to mock them.	30
0	Wow, you're an incredible asshole. You deserve losing your daughter, glad she didn't have to grow up with you as her father. The world dodged a bullet there.	30
0	The other girls need someone to make them all look good.	30
0	I don't understand why anyone would say such horrible things about people. This subreddit is full of hate. Whatever happened to loving one another and accepting people? I agree, the people who deserve the attention are the people in the top row, but saying nasty things about overweight people is ridiculous.	30
0	She's not really thatttt fat	30
0	It's actually more for us who are a size ten, go to the gym regularly and won't be any smaller. I used to be skinny, my genetics probably won't allow that again. I'm not fat but I also won't be comfortable in a bikini because of what people will say. This subreddit is the opposite extreme of what the huge women whining about being ' big boned' and gorging daily is. Body acceptance is about acceptance of all and allowing everyone to be comfortable in their skin - fat, pimply, wrinkled, and the like.	30
0	Eh..not entirely. There are folks out there that have gone through a procedure where their legs are fractured on purpose, braced with a framework, and pulled slightly apart over time which causes the bones to heal longer. Painful, expensive, and very time consuming... But it can be done.	30
0	I'm a 5 with a 27 inch waist and I'm carrying a few extra pounds. You probably have your sizing wrong. and even so, 36 inch hips are huge (mine are 37, they're &gt;huge&lt;) so she would never fit into smaller sizes. Even accounting for the hips, she's nowhere over a 6/8 by modern sizes.	30
0	If getting fat could stop me from being executed I'd eat like a motherfucker.  Something tells me this guy was on the large side before the conviction though...	30
0	I know I'll get downvoted to oblivion for this, but the bottom left one is hot.	30
0	Are these Baltimore Raven cheerleaders?	30
0	Maybe they were raised thinking it was healthy, but saw the truth and started losing weight.	30
0	Today, I learned that people represented by the first row of photos don’t eat.	30
0	Yes! Posted awhile back. Oh the triumph. Thank you (: xx	30
0	photoshop + always holding her face at the same stupid angle makes the neck/chin gangbang disappear temporarily.	30
0	Hey! Second from the right! I'm keeping an eye on you. You're better than that!	30
0	Exactly. If anything they should be railing against her promotion to "model" because it is entirely her genetics that make her "model worthy". She's lucky that her fat has distributed itself relatively evenly over her body and left her face and chin relatively undisturbed.	30
0	Damn I hope some of the lurking planets see thing and feel shame	30
0	&gt; Jew here  I almost banned you for that.	30
0	They're on average less intelligent with smaller penis size.   That and other men just find them so adorable like a little puppy.	30
0	I'm 5'3".  I'm not thin, but I'm a lot thinner than I used to be!	30
0	3^rd from the right too....maybe....a little bit. The upper arms are starting to look a bit doughy.	30
0	He is twice the man that many men five times his weight are.	30
0	You are right, he is wrong.  If you walk 1 mile in 20 minutes, you burn the same number of calories as someone who jogs it in 10 minutes.  But cycling five miles at say 20mph will burn way more calories than cycling five miles at 10mph. That's because at 20mph you are overcoming wind resistance whereas at 10mph you are hardly expending any effort.  So intense biking is a great workout.	30
0	The first chick looks like Brad Pitt	30
0	Y'know what the great thing is? I've got a naturally high metabolism, and coupled with about 50 miles/week of running, I can eat damn near as much of anything I want without gaining a pound. Steak, burgers, fried chicken, beer, beef jerkey, whatever. You don't have to subsist on a strict diet of salad and raw eggs to be a shitlord.	30
0	150? "Solid muscular build but little definition"? 18% BF 5'4" or skellington 5'11? You don't need body acceptance. You don't even need swole acceptance. You need to lift.  You might actually need to put on weight to be muscular. Good job cutting the fat, but you may have cut down to nothing, and now it's time to lift heavy and clean bulk.	30
0	This is primarily a kid's gym, as well as a nonprofit with a very developed outreach program. Please take this post down.  I have been affiliated with this place for ten years. And I do actually believe some of our aerial instructors would say that.  Edit: Of course I think what the instructor said is ridiculous. I'm just saying there are, in fact, instructors who are so pro-fat that I believe that convo took place. Of course, the hams gulp it right up.	30
0	thank goodness she covered up her jabba	30
0	Even resting calories for ~180 lbs is 1800 calories. That's not doing anything at all.	30
0	Sounds like your brain is saturated with fat.  Go SPRINT around the block.	30
0	"I'm big boned" and special in my own way	30
0	They look like real life Mike and Molly	30
0	"Skeleton" is a joke, kind of.   150lbs isn't even remotely muscular unless you're very short. Healthy, yes. Muscular, no. It's likely that you don't have much definition because you don't have much muscle, which is the implication of "skellington"	30
0	Seems like it's uncomfortable with its body to tilt shift out the cottage cheese seeping through its legs... Which.. erm... You kinda uhm... See somehow through the tilt shift...	30
0	...I'm saying it's good if they lose weight, but that sometimes they start off bad?	30
0	Why? You're just adding like 2 pounds of fat to your body. What's the point of cutting if you just immediately fuck it up in one day of retarded eating?	30
0	The guy did lose weight, i'm just giving a reason he could have been fat.  I don't get why we hate former fatties that now actually post here, they know it's bad to be fat now.	30
0	There are two maybe three hammies here, but the one wearing the white shirt is definitely the hammiest.  Edit; a word	30
0	Would you bang them though?	30
0	Hey, she's doing the right thing.	30
0	150 @ 5'11 is damn puny. That aint muscular at all. Infact that's like never having lifted in your life.	30
0	I've definitely worn mine in the bath tub, the shower, the swimming pool, the hot tub....	30
0	Pretty much what me and my best friend used to do was lift and workout at the gym, go to his house and lift even more from the comfort if his home. Smoke weed because fuck it we smoked too much. Was the only times I honestly enjoyed mcdonalds, high, and after a long day of working out. And we only went to mcdonalds like every long now and then, for food we just went to the neighborhood market that is healthy and conveniently close AND BETTER PRICED. reason I say used to is because we arent really friends anymore ;((((((((	30
0	Understanding your own privacy is key.   Learn what the website, users and government can and can't potentially see.	30
0	Also, it's a hat that's not meant to be worn casually. You're a pretty big tool if you wear a fedora with a t-shirt and you're fashion oblivious if you wear one that doesn't match your attire, OR if you wear one and you have round face. It's like wearing a single-vented jacket when you have a big butt.	30
0	left one is kinda hot though...	30

0	this girl doesn't really look that fat to me dude. i mean maybe she could lose like 5lbs?	30
0	You mock people for being fat, so yes you are in 3rd grade.	30
0	Oh fuck off you cunt, I ain't no SJW but I'm not a retarded bully either.	30
0	Tattoos on women are so nasty.	30
0	Any ex ham current shitlords that have kept the weight off for more than a year?  Five years?  Just one means she is wrong they never work.	30
0	My ideal is a halter, slim A-line with a short but elegant train. Gloves up to my upper arms, maybe a modest but sexy cleavage peep. Don't need no sparkles and glam, don't care that it will show off my goofy hips, but it's a damn fine design for a tall slim body imo.	30
0	Any lurking fatties can have an easier choice. A fucking 9mm to the brain. Just please do it in the woods so no one has to clean up after your fat smelly waste.	30
0	OMG he kept falling over! Can't stop! *dying of laughter*	30

0	A large McDonalds fries contains 510 empty calories, not to mention all of that salt would be a real treat in pregnancy when most women are already prone to swelling and retaining water. Idiot.	30
0	A ham isn't "technically overweight" just like a bulimic isn't "technically underweight". 17 and 35 bmi's don't mean the same thing when someone says unhealthy.	30
0	Is that a tranny?	30
0	Well hang on here.  It's very clear that the one on the right is obese and has evident health problems.  Why are we body shaming the one on the left?  Serious question here, can we truly tell that she's anorexic thin?  We can't really see muscle definition, unless that's also because of malnutrition.  I'm just saying that it's hard to judge the situation of the one on the left from just an image.  To me, nothing is immediately apparently wrong.	30
0	Why are you so butthurt? I'm sorry life is so hard for you.	30
0	I mean, I know plenty of dumbass dudes who name their dick and all that but what's more pathetic, is that they're proud of a FUPA. It literally stands for Fat Under the Pussy Area. Only a fuckin idiot would take pride in such a disgusting thing.	30
0	You people do know that not all calories are the same. 500 calories of Chicken is metabolized differently from 500 calories of table sugar. And sugar is in almost all processed food. And sugar is known to cause insulin resistance if you eat too much. Causing glucose from sugar to not be metabolized. all that free glucose in the blood gets turned into fat. Thats how you get obese people over 90% of the time.	30

0	The one on the left doesn't look unhealthy to be honest.  She might be and granted I have no idea who she is, but she just looks thin with a thin frame.  [this](http://www.davidmcelroy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Anorexic-model.jpg) is what I consider anorexic.	30
0	I just don't get the need of people to brag about themselves so much. Don't they know they sound like douchebags?	30
0	That's a pretty pathetic thing to brag about.	30
0	While the girl on the left may not be anorexic, she definitely doesn't look healthy. I hate how the beauty industry actively wants rail thin girls to wear their cloths and walk in front of people looking so shitty. That's not sexy or in anyway appealing you idiots.	30
0	Oh thank you. All the more reason to have pride in a fuckin FUPA... If you hadn't corrected me I would be aimless right now.	30

0	My ex, her family was fat. When they would make popcorn, they would use extra butter microwave popcorn, and they would drizzle on this butter flavored popcorn oil. The thing is, that oil was meant for popping popcorn in a pot, or in a movie theater style popper. A normal person would use a very small amount, but they drenched the popcorn in it. It was disgusting.	30

0	For the acne scars you could do home salicylic peels for fairly inexpensive. If you have the money, you could get dermaplaning or higher level peels that work well.	30
0	Yeah good luck with that  http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303949704579461381883678174  If you run your Ferrari on diesel, it won't run very well. Just because you exercise a lot doesn't make it healthy to smoke, drink excessive alcohol, eat refined sugar.  Clean gains!	30
0	That's good stuff man. I had other scars and a couple stretch marks to deal with and I used bio oil, it worked really well even on old stuff so if you have an extra few bucks to spare you could always try it out. Either way, a few scars will always be better than a bmi of 35! highfive!	30
0	But hes trying to use this sub as a way to motivate himself? If getting rid of fat people is what were trying to do on this sub then why ban him for trying to get fit?  EDIT - I hate fat people too, I'm just saying that this guy seemed to only be here to motivate himself to lose weight. It seems silly to ban him for that.	30
0	I think it is worse than needing a scooter. If you are going to do something, don't do it half ass.	30
0	I am actually 6' and only 290lbs, so I don't consider myself obese. 5 years ago, I was 320 lbs so I've come a long way. I'm proud of myself.  This guy is his worst enemy. I reward myself with cake once in a while or on pay day. It's not excessive, it's about moderation!	30

0	Aren't tons of football players obese? Not talking about their amount of muscle but their at, just because they use it doesn't mean its not there.	30
0	I am shaped like these guys (yes, you should ban me, I quite like fat people when they're not being delusional).  Trust me, most of these guys *are* morbidly obese, by the official definition.	30
0	lol, #9 probably doesn't belong in the set though.	30
0	I'd say your last sentence applies to you more than me. I'm the one saying that there are several highly trained professions. And just because your opinion on what is highly trained is just that; an opinion, yet you treat it like fact speaks more to your bloated self importance than mine.	30
0	Holy shit.  Do our hearts really grow with our bodies like that, or did this particular obeasts heart just say "fuck it, i'm getting fat too."?  I had no idea about this, and it's disgusting.	30
0	Out of curiosity, why do you guys care so much?  I'm getting so bored of these "fat people upset me because they're teaching people being fat is healthy" posts. I'm pretty sure anyone with a brain knows that being fat is unhealthy and if they don't, why do you care if they get fat and have health problems?  Do you think you're "fighting the good fight" or something? I just don't get why you'd put effort into this specific circlejerk.	30

0	This may be motivation for me.  I'm big with fat but I lift weights for years and I am strong with lots of muscles.  Like those big power lifters.  But I see how if I want smaller girl I must get smaller.  Interesting	30
0	I don't know about you but this post makes more sense to me in this context   From the 16th century "to eat one's own heart" (to suffer in silence from anguish or grief), possibly from the Bible "to eat one's own flesh" (to be lazy) The phrase "to eat one's heart out" appears as a formulaic phrase in the Iliad, meaning to experience extreme grief.	30
0	Fat people suffer from malnutrition too, what are you even talking about?	30
0	First, sorry for bad englando.  I make best burgers myself.  Here's recipe:  Take chicken breast or cow meat, cook in pan with little oil of olive, take lettuce and tomato and put on plate, take bread for burger and throw away, bread not good for you.  Le cookies are ready.  Eat now meat and vegetario, pretend is burger.  Mhhmmm very good and tasty for you.	30

0	I have a bubble butt and pointy hip bones/femur heads. I need to squat more to get more muscle on my backside. Currently it's butt, mostly fat storage.	30
0	My shoulder scar is like that. It's re-healed scar tissue too so it's really big and stretched out. I don't mind, in fact I really like it and I think it's cool. Besides, you must have plenty of hilarious fake stories to tell inquiring minds. Shark attack? No wait, you leaped into the path of a speeding car to push a child out of harms way! Fake scar stories are always fun to mess with :P	30
0	Um, let's see... deliver the usual speech? "I'm an oppressive shitlord because I hate fat people and I..." no, screw this speech. *I'm* the logical one for not being a fat lard-ass. Fat-asses should not be considered as people, and they sure as fuck are the real "shitlords" considering the massive sacks of fecal matter that they are.	30

0	I think half this community genuinely hates fat people, ones who deserve it. Then I think the other half that posts nasty shit like this loves fat people. It's like internalized homophobia, so internalized fat phobia?	30
0	It's easier to not eat a twinkie than work out for over an hour to burn those calories. Knowing that you could actually save money and get healthy!	30
0	Holy shit. So proud of the Costa Ricans for this.	30
0	Right, but what dumba** would eat 500 calories of table sugar? We, as humans, weren't meant to process that. It is *unnatural*. Just as being obese is.   You are preaching to the choir.	30

0	Exactly! Just eat less and you lose weight. Granted I'm stuck in a skinnyfat body for the rest of my life but good god, it's better than fat.  Edit: goos god people when I say " skinny fat" I mean no muscle definition. I'm on chemotherapy so I'm pretty pale and sad looking but my BMI is 21. chill.	30

It'd be different if she put herself in that position, making remarks about how much better she is than others, but all she did was post a damn picture.   This sub is to fat people is like Hitler is to Jews or the KKK is to black people.	30

0	I'm speculating, but England is kind of infamous for being a nanny state. It's possible that she reported the fake accounts to FB (or people she know did) and at that point the state may be able to charge whoever owns that account, taking it out of the hands of the victim (same person in this case) to retract/cancel the charges.   You can find similar actions in domestic abuse cases, where if the state become involved charges are pressed even if the battered party doesn't want them to be.	30

0	While I understand the hate given I follow this page, I have to admit that generalizing all Americans as some have is a bit unfair. There are a lot of Americans on this page that share the fat hate.  Not sure why any of you are compelled to paint the whole nation with this obese brush.  It's not a battle I care to fight, so I've said my peace.  Down vote if you must.	30
0	For some weird reason, I threw thrash towards her on my monitor. I just can't tell the difference.	30

0	god damn 25 years old and mods fatpeoplehate, get a fuckin life brother. and you guys think everyone that hates on this sub is a fatty, how delusional.	30
0	Serious question; are you all unemployed or in school or something similar? I just don't see how a normal person could put the time in to do that all day long (or why they'd want to). Just mods generally I guess, not exclusively this sub.   Like I work, have a family, go to gym, socialise, watch TV, play sports etc. How can sitting on a forum all day be healthy (not just talking physical health here either).	30
0	lol - the universal symbol of being defeated/pissed off. hope this felt good seeing as its what you do to everyone you make fun of in this sub. BAN BAN BAN BAN	30
0	&gt;As long as you aren't fat  More like "as long as you don't show ham logic"	30
0	The too skinny chick could gain 15 lbs and be fine still a bit thin but fine as long as she didnt have mental issues from anorexia.  The fat chick next to her could loose all her fat and still have a wrecked body with extra skin being fat is so incredibly damaging its insane that people loose so much control.	30

0	she did the appropriate thing	30

0	Yup. I attended Sydney's premier boys school. We had 3 fat guys (read strong lads rhat couldnt stop eating pies) I'min our grade and they all played front row. When I went to uni in far northern nsw I couldn't believe the amount of tubsters we had up there. I just never knew people my age could consciously decide to do that to themselves	30
0	I actually have "starved" in lieu of eating McDonalds.  We were on a road trip and the ONLY thing available at this stop was a McD's.  We kept driving another 2 hours before we got to eat lunch.

0	Isn't the peace sign hand facing forward?	30
0	So you date weight lifters?	30
0	Over hyped,  NSA issues have nothing to do with freedom as no one was "less free"  because of it.   There are things you literally can't say in many European countries (and Canada)  which is why a site like reddit could never be hosted there.	30
0	This sub makes some good points, but is largely ridiculous and silly. You're not infamous because you made a difference, or you matter. You're infamous because you're assholes. Whether you're right or wrong is another story altogether.	30

0	Reddit most definitely is not but that's a private decision not a government one.	30
0	Well you know finding the better of two poisons or something.	30
0	That's why it's irrelevant to mention reddit when it's self censoring/manipulating itself to not offend or cross the line	30
0	Look closer.  That gut is real	30
0	Haha lmao. What you need to understand is that anyone unverified who talks about his own body in a post will be accused of being a hambeast. Getting verified is the best thing you can do to avoid future problems. Too many secret fatties around these parts. Especially if you're going to post more great things like the one before.	30
0	It can mean clever and quick witted, greedy or having an appendage that can grab something. Examples using a common theme:   Jews have a prehensile ability to dominate global financial markets.  Jews have a prehensile love for money.   Jews have prehensile tails.	30
0	When people usually put /r/thathappened, I see it as an incredibly lazy attempt at contributing to the conversation. Yet somehow they get the upvotes. At least try to explain why it didn't and not be so lazy you can't even type out some sort of explanation. When I see someone do that I automatically imagine them sweating all over their keyboard with greasy food in their hand while they shit in a trashcan because they can't even. Thank you for actually writing something out and not just putting generic bullshit.	30

0	There are no statistics because there are so many trans people who don't identify that way. Some trans people only use it during the transition and not after. I would guess there are a hell of a lot more trans people than anyone would ever believe.	30
0	5 Michigan units?  I think the man + kids are probably 225? So yeah, 500 lbs is probably about right.	30
0	So are all overweight people land whales now? I mean she is definitely overweight, but doesn't the term land whale mean less when we use it to describe any overweight person as opposed to the really fat, morbidly obese ones.	30
0	I don't know how they are for women, but I've heard Target's men sizes run smaller than average.	30
0	Exactly. Go to FL with that mindset. Even people who've lost the weight who make self-congratulatory posts grind my gear. I'm not going to pat you on the back for starting to do what you should've been doing all along. There are other subs for that.	30
0	a neckbeard doesn't make a jawline..	30
0	Seems buff...all black makes it hard to tell. Prob fat.	30
0	I never claimed to be thin, just thinner than I used to be, and having hourglass proportions that I never had before.  Yes, I have more to lose, I never said I was done losing weight.  I'm a size 10.  I wouldn't consider that a "whale", but thanks for showing how much expectation there is to be a size...what would you consider not a whale...0?  I'll get right on that just to for you. There's no pleasing you people, is there?	30
0	Nah man. Only sociopaths in this sub.	30
0	I come from a very fat family as well, but the whole term of "genetically fat" is dumb as shit.  My family is fat because they have no self control, not because it was ingrained in their dna or predestined to be fat.  So no, you were not "genetically fat", you were just born into a family who just gave up, or never cared to begin with.    I'm very happy you lost the weight, but even when you use "genetically fat" it's just as bullshit as when you get mad at other people saying it.	30
0	you've for quite a chubby face though..	30
0	Greed is not an addiction!  Food is not addictive... if it were, everyone would be fat.	30
0	Don't be mad you can't flaunt your body	30
0	Lol social courtesy. That doesn't exist, look at your shitty red herring argument,  logic doesn't exist to you either I guess. You just mad because it's not what YOU would have done. Get over yourself.	30
0	She was going to say, "young" but then she saw the donut and "yum" came out instead. Tattoo artists aren't mind readers, so that's what she got.	30
0	Yeah, he's definitely fat and definitely gross, but this post has no point.	30
0	Fat women run faster.	30
0	Yeah, but most posts are them saying/doing something stupid. They're at least engaging in some way. This is just some fatass fucking around in the water. I feel nothing.	30
0	I know this is fat people hate but a large reason why people are fat is because junk food is cheap lol...	30
0	I don't think a "normal" man has to have a six pack, but I'd like him to be somewhere closer to that as opposed to looking like he's pregnant. I  *kind of*  get where this "movement" is coming from, but of course, morons have already taken over and turned it into something gross.	30
0	&gt; I disagreed with some decision behind the scenes  You said that right above.  Because of us?	30
0	I know. So don't come here and spew bullshit when I already explained why you were demodded. You were demodded due to inactivity. Not because of some stupid personal vendetta.	30
0	Yeah go fuck yourself. Person is fat so why look at what they could be when you can look at what they are. Seeing potential in something that doesn't have anything is disgusting.  Banned for retardation.	30
0	Why not call yourselves egalitarian then? I think it's more appropriate than feminism or masculism.	30
0	That's the word. Feminism has been hi-jacked by radicals long ago. I think this is the correct term for those who seek non-gender based equality.	30
0	I know it was a typo, but the word 'cupidity' in this context made me think of a swole cupid possessing lifters to give them injuries.   EDIT: Cupidity is not a typo, I'm an idiot, but it still made me giggle.	30

0	No, there most definitely is. I have a shoulder width of 42", a size 36/38" waist and am under 15% body fat. There are plenty of men who are wide without being fat. Not every tall person is built like a string bean.	30
0	Actually, it's just to see their friends. I grew up in a town of 2000 (Osgood, Ohio), and literally the only thing to do was to go to a bar. People are social creatures, they don't go to the bar to avoid their wives and kids, they go to see their buddies.	30
0	So what would you call someone with my build? 42" shoulders, 38'' ish waist and under 15% body fat? I'm not obese, or even over weight but I'm wider than the average male. I don't have love handles, either.	30
0	Thank you,  I'm new to reddit and super confused about how things work- still embarrassed by the whole "select gomez" thing	30
0	post a picture of your body then tubby	30
0	That was supposed to be a joke. Ah well, never mind.	30
0	flair for hating fat cunts. have you seen her obesity for yourself? it's gross AF.	30
0	At least she is useful to society, unlike most hams. Where would we be without the "funny" fat girl from the movies?  Edit; /s	30
0	Funny this chart says I'm almost obese, but I've got abs. It's just muscle from weight lifting and strength training.	30
0	You get these people who marry a normal size human and then the SO blows up for some reason but then the person will stick with them.  I dont get it.	30
0	Being shirtless isn't a douche thing, it's just a lack of class. Douches tend to enjoy being shirtless, sure, but not all shirtless people are douches.	30

0	I knew a guy who had heart problems from a birth defect, and he still was fit enough to run a seven minute mile. How the hell is six minutes exhausting?	30
0	In the first pic she clearly looks like 13~15yo.  &gt;Kids are off limits because they have little to no say over their diets and if they are fat it's more than likely there is at least one adult to blame. The only time we'll allow posts dealing with overweight children is if the hate is clearly directed at the adult (meaning there has to be an adult in the actual content of the post, not just the title), with no room for confusion.  http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate/wiki/rules	30
0	I'm guess I'm a douche; I love going shirtless. Nothing silences the hams like a shirtless guy who spends a lot of time at the gym.	30
0	Yikes...Um...what thigh gap?	30
0	You do know America isn't the only country with fat asses, right? Go anal prolapse with a cactus.	30
0	Nothing, it's still a seaham.	30
0	Triggered. I end up eating vegan most days and I get sick of people telling me I eat "cardboard" and I'm "torturing myself just to lose weight." Fuck you. I love my soy cheese pizza, almond milk, vegan stir fries, and fruit + rice protein shakes. Just because I found ways to make fruits and veggies taste good doesn't make me a tryhard and it doesn't mean I'm "dieting". Newsflash: everyone is on a diet! Mine just happens to be *truly* tastier and far healthier than yours, so shut your fat gob. /rant	30
0	Yeah... also all that hair on its forearm... oh goshhh	30
0	You shouldn't need to buy water. Its free and perfectly drinkable out of the faucet.  Edit: I'm referring to the ham planets in first world countries that justify buying soda for a few dollars because its cheap. They have perfectly free drinkable water coming out of their faucet but still choose soda. I understand that not everywhere has this luxury. Can we get back to being shit lords?	30
0	I agree on this, troll.  The fact the she openly says 20 piece nugget. In reality she would have gone "a 3 piece nuggets because i didn't have any breakfast or lunch..."	30

0	True. My doctor is retired now, at the VA but when I would have an appointment, she would ask me if I had time for a cigarette, and we'd go out by the loading dock (haven't smoked in years, but that doesn't mean I never will again) and puff away.	30

0	Big boned is literally just an expression. I know I do not have thicker bones, I am saying my bones are naturally wider and larger.	30
0	"Does not instantly mean they're fat."  I agree.  That's why I asked a question instead of assuming.  Asking if someone is fat is not the same as calling someone fat.  I notice you're not verified.  Are you fat?	30
0	This doesn't infuriate, inspire or even compare to most pictures we get. It's a shitpost, get over it. I mean, this is fat people *hate*, not "look at this random fat guy". Give me liars, people trying to hide their fat, people making excuses, people being proud of being gross, ginormous fucking whales, just give me *something*.	30
0	Delusion/denial is an easier way than eating less and exercising.	30
0	If you have $10 a month, I would highly suggest UFC fight pass if you want to catch up on MMA history. They have full fight libraries from PRIDE and other organizations.	30

0	You're the normal person here.  They'll be dead from their condishuns before turning 40.	30
0	Holy shit did you even read my post?	30
0	HAES, fuck yeah!  Good riddance.	30
0	Where did he say they're fat BECAUSE junk food is cheap? He barely even mentioned fat people, if anything only to prevent people from thinking he was an obeast sympathiser.	30
0	This...makes me sad.	30
0	Alright I'll just go to my local reservation to see the medicine man from now on.	30
0	Lol usually they are pretty strong tho, funny thing is fat people and body builders usually have the same body type, which is called endomorphic.  Jus saying	30
0	Change the plus sign to an equal and just get rid of the "=5". Photoshop idea?	30

0	It would've only been perfect if it was a NSFL video and she did die. Would have made my day	30
0	beard and tattoos is so hot regardless	30
0	Are.  Not is.	30
0	More like  &gt;Here's A Before And A 5 Minutes After Shot.	30
0	Who? If you read the response from the shop owner, the measurements are listed "in."  60cm is a normal waist and wouldn't be posted in FPH.	30
0	In the YouTube version of this someone posted that they read she died 20 minutes later from internal bleeding.  Best case scenario, what we see with this video is the moment someone became a paraplegic. There's nothing funny about any of it.	30
0	I didn't down vote. I read back and saw the person above you got it wrong and you were responding to them.	30
0	&gt; sad pole  never heard that one before, thanks shitlord!	30
0	woundt call it human more like silicon based lifeforms	30
0	This picture... I like it.	30
0	To then rebuild them topsy turvy.	30
0	Haha I don't doubt it. I mean, I've had fine pizza in other states, it just isn't so widely available.	30
0	Why would it need to be NSFL?	30
0	They want to be seen as conventionally beautiful but the conventionally beautiful are nhft and they're too lazy to put in the work so they pretend they don't care about conventions while still trying to conform to the conventions that don't take work.	30
0	save the world... not the wales	30
0	Means you identify with your biological gender, but often act in ways that are considered the opposite gender (male that acts fem /  female that does masculine things) but still identifies as their born gender.  Woman that lifts and loves football or male who loves shopping and reality TV.	30
0	In that case, I feel like I've seen hankles, stankles, and the occasional chankles. *shudders*	30
0	They'll have to blame it on the moon.	30
0	Im 6' 220 and my friend and i do calisthenics every other month. We do 4-500 pushups every other day, 100-150 dips EVERY day, and 100+ pullups EVERY day along with other shit. Depending on grip location, (inside, outside, wide, under hand, overhand etc) and how im feeling that day, we shoot for 15-20 a set, 8-10 sets.   The best though are weighted dips and pullups. Right now i can do 8-10 reps of pullups at 45lbs and 4-5 at 90. And i can get 15-20 at 45 for dips and 8-10 at 90. Weighted is where its at!	30
0	It's hilarious and disgusting.	30
0	But the moon is the one drowning!	30
0	Any reason you aren't verified, "former" ham?	30
0	they are all so fat... and hideous	30
0	Nigga quit stealing my titles	30
0	Bro, it was obviously sarcasm, what the fuck?	30
0	She's lucky an orca didn't beach slide in and take her out. For dinner.   Would have been much better of a video.	30
0	No it doesn't. Women make anywhere from 60-90 percent per hour then an equally trained man.   Edit: Wording was wrong	30
0	Just going, "Ha, he's fat" isn't fun to me.  If I can go, "Damn, he's so fat he makes walrus look normal.", then I'm having fun.  Come on, this ain't second grade.	30
0	Also that arm hair...	30
