The kind of divestment actually required is moving away from needing quite so much fossil fuel energy in your life.  If you sell all your stock in Exxon, feel smug about yourself, and then continue driving around in a petrol driven car then the only thing you have changed is the makeup of your investment portfolio.	0
0	Did you even read it?  This is mostly about fertilizers.  &gt;Making full use of crop residues as forage for cattle, collecting and composting cattle manure, and replacing part of the chemical fertilizer input with organic manure have been successfully shown to be ideal choices to reduce energy waste and cut GHG emissions without crop yield losses  So using a more natural approach combined with chemical fertilizers.  So not completely replacing chemicals but using integrated methods.  As to your points.  1. So?  2. Mostly about fertilizers, but any farmer putting the effort to do something other than spray chemicals for everything would probably reduce pesticide use.  3.  They never suggested that.	0

1	The justice department is responsible for policing the financial markets and is responsible for enforcing regulations. The Bush administration was famously lax in that regard.  [The Credit Crisis: The Bush Administration's Record of Denial and Regulatory Neglect](http://www.dpc.senate.gov/dpcdoc.cfm?doc_name=fs-110-2-171)  It was the height of irresponsibility to simply allow Leman brothers to collapse. That is what set the dominos tumbling and the reason we had to institute a 800 billion dollar bailout. If Bush would have stepped in, nationalized Leman Bros, and examined the large banks there would not have *been* a crash.  Yeah...it was the Bush administration's fault!	1

0	Enormous political will?!?!?!? How about politicians stop being fucking assholes.  What's so hard about that?	1
1	Well, for starters a fringe candidate usually has no chance of winning the general election. As a progressive, I love Bernie Sanders but for American politics he is far left of center. In fact, he is the MOST liberal senator in our country (data below).  On the liberal to conservative scale, Hillary ranks 11. Bernie Sanders ranks 1, Obama ranked 23 and Coburn ranks 101.  http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/31/1374629/-Hillary-Clinton-Was-the-11th-Most-Liberal-Member-of-the-Senate  To win the general election, you have to appeal to the most people, which is usually achieved by being centrist. Therefore, it is very unlikely to see a winner who is on the extreme of either ideology.	1
1	Not necessarily inflationary. it's still the same amount of money injected into the system . It would just simply have gone to the real estate market rather than the military industrial complex. It definitely would have inflated house prices. Without the war we wouldn't need a lot of soldiers, so rather than going into the military all those young men would have gone into the construction trades building all those houses. Of course belying this entire argument is that our housing market was already over inflated and collapsed. So obviously we didn't need that many houses in the first place. A better example would have been some sort of industry. Free education and healthcare perhaps?	1

1	I'm sure we're all here intimately familiar with FPTP voting at this point. That is a huge roadblock, no question, but that doesn't change the reality that this is exactly the fear leveraged by the two parties to retain power and ignore the desires of the electorate. At the risk of accelerationism, nothing's going to change if we're not willing to take meaningful risks and accept difficult sacrifices. *Every* presidential election has carried the threat of loathsome Supreme Court nominees used to compel votes for an otherwise unacceptable platform. It is the DNC's job to build a platform and select candidates that attract my vote.	1

Obama championed a lot of important progress for the country even if I don't agree with all of his positions (particularly war issues).  I suspect Hillary would be similar.

1	Politics is dirty as all hell. There is plenty of opportunity to fight like a politician, and knowing Bernie's ample history, I would not be surprised if he understands that.   That said, this goes beyond mere campaigning challenges. This is the core principle of his platform - not to represent the interests of the billionaire donors who manipulate politics, but rather embrace the interest of the public.   That is the very essence of what his ideology and function is.   If I had a decision on how to run presidential elections, I'd give all candidates $200K after collecting enough signatures to qualify for campaign funds.	1

1	This is always the thing that gets me about the "min. wage retail/food service jobs aren't meant for working adults" argument.  It's so damn hard to get OUT of a minimum wage job, if only because the skills you earn aren't often very useful in the higher-paying white collar or blue-collar worlds.

If our society cannot produce voters with enough sense in their head to make an informed decision, then our country has wrought what it sowed.

1	Bernie is a great alternative, dude. Warren is about a decade younger, so she has more time to be in the Senate and to then run for POTUS, if that interests her. At the moment, she's not interested at all. She's said so herself *many* times. Best thing you can do to get a country that Warren envisions? If your state has closed primaries, register as a Democrat, and then in the primaries vote for Bernie. He's our best shot.	1
0	&gt;&gt; they come in and take your factory.  &gt;Yeah, I'm thinking the person(s) who invested all of their time and money and life to building that factory might see a problem with that approach.   Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, John D Rockefeller, Henry Ford, Louis Chevrolet, Ray Kroc, John Queeney, Alexander Graham Bell, Frederick Koch and a plethora of other dead guys are gonna be pissed about losing their "factories".	1

1	&gt;In some right-wing circles, however, “Jade Helm 15” is the basis for an extraordinary conspiracy theory. The idea gets a little convoluted – fringe theories often are – but the unhinged activist apparently believe the Obama administration, in conjunction with the U.S. military and Wal-Mart, is planning to impose martial law on much of the country. As they see it, the plan also includes gun confiscation and “secret underground tunnels.”  Wow, just wow! And they think Walmart is in on this grand conspiracy?	1
0	The fact that his family owns the home.	1
1	&gt; They create more jobs and more intellectual capital  How does defunding research create "intellectual capital?"  Much less jobs.	1
1	And the Fall of Man. Can't forget how he offered health insurance to Adam.	1

0	I wonder how long this circlejerk can continue.	1
0	rich white folks, poor white trash gets the boots too	1
1	I don't know about you, but I get the sense that these investigations take so long and the findings kept secret because all of those involved are wracking their brains desperately trying to come up with a scenerio where the officers can be shown to be not guilty of any wrong doing. This in contrast to them trying for the exact opposite when investigating an ordinary citizen.	1
1	Right? Isn't that fucky?	1

1	Well, if you look at Warren and Clinton's voting records and positions they are very similar on most issues.   Yes Clinton has raised a lot of money from Wall Street, but so will any eventual nominee for the R or D in the general election. Obama started his campaign saying he wouldn't accept those big donations, but changed his tune once he realized he needed them to win.  EDITED to better answer your question.	1
1	so basically its all about selfishness (and greed).	1
0	&gt;I have an M.S. In mathematics. Logic is my strong point.  Some guy on the Internet who can't understand the difference between engineering and general research, and thinks an engine designed to operate in a wide variety of environments can't handle a slight change in average conditions over decades, is telling me he has an M.S. in mathematics.	1
1	Well it's probably because of how poorly he handled Katrina.	1
1	No, candidates raising money from billionaires who donate to anonymous super pacs is something to sneer at.   Raising money by appealing to voters is pretty much exactly how elections should be run assuming there isn't public campaign financing.	1
0	Rationale?  You are the clown defending Rolling Stone in the face of  the UVA, Will Dana and Sabrina Rubin Erdely debacle.

0	Not at all.  Where are these liberal utopias that have tax rates as low?  Especially on the middle and upper middle class.	1
0	&gt;He's less liberal than FDR.  Well, no, he's not.  FDR wasn't particularly weak on defense, for one.  Regardless, "less liberal than FDR" isn't a huge hurdle, and even if it were true, it doesn't preclude "but still way too liberal" from being an option.	1
0	I've written lengthy posts about this in response to people who asked me the same question you did. You chose to not read them and instead ask me the same question that I already answered.	1
0	I think one of us is interpreting something wrong.... I agree that Hillary definitely accepted bribes, but she will never face charges.  I probably missed some sarcasm somewhere.	1
0	Quite frankly I hate the comparison to Ron Paul. While they have one thing in common: the fact they are honest, when it comes to the issues they are vastly different. I could never have supported Ron Paul and it genuinely worries me that people are already comparing Sanders to him when they're worlds apart.  And that word: "Presidential"? What's it even supposed to mean? Not rich enough? Lacks a careful presentation dictated by opinion polls?	1
1	&gt;Republicans love service members except when they're home.	1
0	Oh Christ.  Truth and honesty change the world.  Bumper sticker pablum and shared lies do not.	1
1	I'm glad others think the same exact way (first time donating, probably going to volunteer).  Hell, I may push my organization to try and put on event to help high school/college students to register to vote (not support a certain candidate, but just to get them to vote).	1
0	The point about the course of events seems to be that a Terry stop never happened, because Gray ran away. I don't know the relevant laws in Maryland, but running away from police is considered to be obstruction of justice in most states, which would again be a reason for arrest.	1
0	It's funny how the right is aligned with the Christians' position and the left is aligned with the Satanists' position. Very appropriate.. I think.	1

1	That's what they're trying to point out. Laws that are created or exempted because of religion have no business being laws. It's 2015 and the US has citizens of all faiths. So to favor one is discriminatory.	1

1	We don't often see a reasonable, compassionate, level-headed and most of all not bought-out American presidential candidate.

1	Its hard for a Dr to make more than $10k a week at those rates.	1

1	It seems to me that Chomsky addressed every question posed by Harris. He outlined the reasons why he believes Clinton's motivations for the Al-Shifa attack are immoral (reckless retaliation without regard for human life), why he doesn't think the professed intentions of world leaders are meaningful, and why he refuses to engage Sam in a public debate. Just because Chomsky comes off as accusatory doesn't mean that his remarks should be ignored.	1
0	Well, I am sorry for expecting more than mindless hero-worship of politicians from Reddit.  I come here for substantive discussions, *not*:  "Oh, hes dreamy!"  "I love him ever so much!"  "Everyone loves him and you will too!"  "EEEK! BERNIE SANDERS!"	1

0	It's not just an overseas/domestic dichtomy. Laying off of economic espionage would make EU countries much more likely to cooperate on security. Also, following the legal process and prosecuting terrorists, instead of disappearing them would be helpful.  full disclosure: Am EU citizen.	1

1	They're not upset when Christians are defensive. they're delighted.	1
0	It is not on-topic. Internships at a foundation are not political, whether paid or unpaid.  We have allowed many other submissions that talk about the foreign money going to Hillary. This isn't bias, it's application of the rules.	1
0	TLDR: He is a self described socialist.	1
0	Get Annoyed, Emotion-counter!	1
0	&gt;First, Sanders is liberal, and can sincerely sell a liberal vision to Democratic primary voters. Unlike Martin O’Malley, whose past public statements qualify as “moderate” according to OnTheIssues.org, Sanders is a “hardcore liberal.” On a standardized scale of -100 to 100 (with -100 being the most conservative and 100 being the most liberal), **Sanders hits 54**; O’Malley’s only a 25. **Clinton is a 53**.  That is some buuulllllshhit	1

1	Do you also oppose laws against theft, arson and murder?  What if I make my free decision to rob you, kill you, and set everything you've ever cared about on fire?  What about if I make the free decision to open an online store, save customer's credit card numbers, and then steal everything they own?  I mean they knew the risks giving someone that information, right?	1
0	He didn't say anything about shutting down the NSA. Just dismantling the spying program. The NSA does more than spy on us.	1
0	I'm just ruling out you saying "what if the majority of Vermont residents wanted to kill all Muslims"	1
1	How is illegally arresting/false imprisonment different than kidnapping/abduction? (I am curious about the legal differences, not suggesting they are the same) It is my understanding that and death caused by the latter is always charged as 1st degree murder, even if it is an accident or caused by the victim.   Edit: clarification	1
1	It means he has much larger voter support from the tens of thousands of people who believe his campaign is worth donating to. Compare this to the 10 to 100 votes that can be counted upon by the other candidates from their few rich donors.  Money does not win the presidency votes do.	1
1	If they were blind, they wouldnt know he was black.	1
0	Which corporations, specifically, are seeing the drafts?   Also, the USTR is made up of representives, economists, industry folks, ambassadors, etc. It's not just our corporate llizard overlords.	1
1	Agreed.  I remember Ross Perot and Ralph Nader.  I jumped hard on the Obama train in his first election.  I really believed he was going to be a real game changer.  Eh..he hasn't been a bad president but the bill of goods sold was certainly not delivered.     I'll vote for Bernie in the general if given the opportunity though.  Oh sweet naivete...how I miss thee.	1
1	Not since Ross Perot and Ralph Nader have I given a presidential candidate this much money before. Even if he loses, I want his ideas spread so other candidates and our country at least discuss them.	1

1	I didn't know Bernie Sanders was a woman.	1
1	&gt; Many police "abuses" only seem that way because people conveniently forget all about what the so-called "victim" did prior in order to attract the police attention.  What was Gray's crime, again?	1

0	Big government control over everything about your life and Redistribution of wealth. Elitist Collectivism.	1
0	Aw. Without that money he has no chance to win. :(  I know we all wish it wouldn't be the case, but it is. If I were him I'd take the money and once elected say "Fuck all ya, I'll do what I want."	1
0	And I'd think there must be more than a few trust-worthy Canadian-Americans who could set up a paetron or something and just *randomly* decide to donate all money from foreign donations toward this politician.	1

(Tell yer Buddy Ted Cruz I said hello while yer there)  In the meantime:  **Clinton Foundation Expenses**  * 88.4% - Programs  * 7% - Management and General Expenses  * 4.6% - Fundraising   BTW - Their accounting is done by Pricewaterhouse Coopers and then audited by BKD.  Two of the largest accounting firms in the US.  But who are you going to believe?	1

0	I'm not saying you're a bad or weak person.  I'm saying that unless you are the one in the line of fire, you don't get to self-aggrandize with the nobility of your stance.	1
1	There is no way that you can say lower wages are not beneficial to employers. That makes literally no sense.    So the claim I think you're making is that public assistance does not put downward pressure on pay. That may be true, but the resolution, to raise minimum wage, would clearly address public assistance needs AND would cause employers to pay more.    Do you think employers want to pay more now, and, if so, why are that not?	1
0	&gt; A major reason for many to call themselves libertarian is to distance themselves from the GOP.  To distance themselves from the social conservatives and the religious right, and some will identify libertarian to distance themselves from the Democrats' nanny state tendencies.  It's a whole lot easier for someone to just be an independent and it'll allow you to freely criticize both parties on any of the issues, including on the subjects and party platform policies which are usually off-limits to criticism.	1
1	that may have something to do with sanders knowing basic economics, history, and political science, unlike paul?  Its funny how people who spend there life reporting and studying politics hate a guy who says things that are untrue or make no sense in their field, huh?	1
0	Well if this kid was working and perusing non-destructive hobbies he would be alive. Instead he chose to go gang-banging and dealing drugs. The police are no better, trigger happy and clearly racists. So why was this kid, and so many others, happy to give the corrupt police a reason to screw them?	1
0	That's precisely why Democrats don't want to fix it.  They know that it essentially gives them de facto amnesty.  They expand the government and expand their voter rolls.  Win-win.	1
1	&gt; It's not a civil contract because it binds third parties. The interesting guarantees of marriage - visitation rights, shared insurance, heritability of benefits - cannot be recreated with the unlimited right to contract.  Nor can things like ease of immigration, not being forced to testify against a spouse, different taxation, etc.	1
0	Please be civil. This is a warning.	1

0	Amen!  How cool would it be (not that this would be likely to happen) if they formed a secret alliance to nominate one another for Vice President.  Paul/Sanders, Sanders/Paul.  I'd love it.	1
0	The crushingly depressing realities of our world are a result of everyone behaving like you.  If everyone behaved like me, on the other hand, they wouldn't *dare* not make Bernie Sanders the Dem nominee.  And we'd have a president Dennis Kucinich in the WH, not Bush III.	1

1	I live in the high tax and rapidly growing Minnesota.  We have a budget surplus over $1 billion USD.  The governor raised the minimum wage.

1	Compared to the rest of the world? Yeah.	1
1	They will continue to do so because they have political sway derivative from application of those profits and there is insufficient political will to change the system.  The ACA was an incredibly benign bit of legislation and the Republicans raised holy hell.  Moving to a straight single payer model will be a herculean political feat.	1
0	Because you will hurt the cause you are hoping to support.  If you want a campaign like this to actually make a difference you have to give a rat's ass about logic.  You owe it to him to be effective.	1
1	Can he actually win against the republican candidate, though?   That's my fear. He manages to beat Hilary, and then loses the presidency.	1
0	Is it bad that I'd guess more than half the voting population has no idea what Orwellian means?	1

A little research was in order - Representative Todd Smith "retired" after being defeated in the Texas senate election in 2012. He opposed discriminatory voter ID. Kelly Hancock, who won, is a "true conservative", elected by those same idiots.	1

0	If any Democrat were serious about the decline of the middle class and lack of employment opportunities in black hotspots like Ferguson and Baltimore, she (or he) would immediately call for a cessation of legal and illegal immigration, which is the primary cause of the decline in opportunity for Americans and the death of the American dream. But immigrants vote Democratic. Rigging elections through demographic change brought about through immigration is worse than being bought by billionaires.	1

0	You're right.   Hey everyone, Hillary's husband is a mass-murderer who starved **FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN TO DEATH** trying to conquer Iraq for the Empire.  She should be COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE to you.  Voting for her is literally worse than voting even for someone like David Duke.   Remember, voting for mass-murdering imperialist warmongers is BAD and WRONG. If you do it you're a BAD person and you should feel BAD.	1

1	Cause college tuition could never create an bubble	1
1	I would challenge anyone who believes that the voter should not know who is paying for "electioneering" ads to tell me why.   People certainly have not been intimidated - unless you are a troll and are going to argue that you are afraid to address an issue via a sane discussion.   The KOCHs have admitted that they are willing to spend millions to affect the outcome of the elections - the whine is hilarious, because the ignorance is that we don't know Immediately, but do know, after the election.    How is that speed relative to "freedom of speech".	1

1	What makes it even funnier is how *popular* the most-vetoey president if it's FDR.  He got elected **four** times. No one else had ever done that (and yes, there were ones that wanted a third term).	1
1	Sadly I think Hillary will win because of the whole "first female president!!!" gimmick.	1
0	&gt;The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman’s right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy, including a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay. We oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right. Abortion is an intensely personal decision between a woman, her family, her doctor, and her clergy; there is no place for politicians or government to get in the way.	1
0	&gt;But if the labor still isn't worth it, then the job goes away. It should. However that has never happened.   Really?  No job in the history of mankind has ever gone away because of the price of labor?  Every possible labor application that has ever had a human doing it still exists?  I'm going to have to ask for proof on that one.	1

0	With your help! Now is that hard to understand.  You are the third to send me mail today, you are so lucky. Try sending some to your Representative and Senator, State and Federal!  This is called support.  I out that your party leaders will be impressed, unless you donate a few thousand.	1
1	He's running as a democrat	1
1	I agreed with some of the authors sentiments in the article. However thinking Michael Browns strong armed robbery of a convenience store right before his fatal encounter with the police office shouldn't be part of the conversation is ridiculous.  Stating things were calming down before the Brown video was released is laughable and a pathetic effort to blame others for inexcusable behavior.	1
0	Well the american voting system is screwed also. My last time voting they asked me which group. I told them independent and I got a confused look, then I get my ballot and a lot of items were taken off, so I couldn't vote for either candidate. I live in Georgia which is fucked in a lot of ways. [Private probation companies]( https://youtu.be/0UjpmT5noto)	1

1	They usually do. Satanists don't really care that their literature is distributed or their goat statues placed at courthouses. They want Christians to see that doing similar things for their religion can be just as offensive to others. Likewise, they don't generally think religion should be used to influence or carve out exceptions to broadly applicable laws. But as long as Christians feel the need to do, they will attempt to show them how offensive that seems to outgroups.	1
1	This guy is hilariously stupid to the point where I can't even hate him anymore. Watching him speak is entertaining (unlike Scott Walker, who genuinely scares me).	1
0	That seems like a vast overstatement...  There might be a few domestic advantages, but he would be hamstrung by the right-wing congress (including the center-right party of which he would technically be the head) to the point where nothing which was truly significant would change.	1
0	Very unironically. The "Right" seeks to anchor our future to the outdated ideologies of postwar (WWII) America and their only solution is to incite new wars and exploit humanity's desire to murder itself based on archaic belief systems (and profit from it!).   Don't allow internal conflicts to fracture the base. Stand together and generate dialogue and civil debate between like minded individuals who perhaps disagree on certain issues.   Let the "right" wallow in their own bullshit.	1
1	&gt; Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox has procured a 5 per cent stake in Vice Media for $70m (£45m).  yes, But  &gt;Vice’s own senior management still controls some 75 per cent of the company. That, Mr Smith added, “gives us the freedom to do what we want to do”.	1
0	Pretty sure that statements like "I think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people" would lock up the GOP nomination for Mother Teresa.	1
0	My employer can't afford to give their employees all a 14% raise, and would likely lose significant business if they raised prices to cover the shortfall.  The result would be people getting laid off.	1
0	If anyone knows the pulse of the astro-surfing sock-puppets of reddit politice, one would realize that Bernie is another shill.   One positive mention of U.S. Air Force Captain (and former 22 term Congressman) OBGYN Dr. Ron Paul (3 time presidential candidate), and you get down-voted to oblivion.    Senator Bernie Sanders (multiple term political figure) gets mentioned, and it makes the front page.  **Your** masters are hiding behind the internet.	1
0	I never claimed that the Democrats intend to overturn Roe v Wade. They wrap themselves in Roe v Wade while seeking to go much further. I think I'm being pretty reasonable here.   Planned Parenthood is an extreme organization led by someone who is in favor of elective late term abortion, and its founder Margaret Sanger was even more extreme.   Abortion's simply not going away as an issue. Not in either of our lifetimes. Gay marriage can mostly go away, if both sides can respect each other's right to disagree. Even that will never fully go away as an issue.	1
1	I wouldn't be surprised if Monday night Jon Stewart apologizes for that.  I think he's probably gotten a lot of messages from Bernie supporters explaining how that line made him part of the problem.  Granted, I think his intention was right on in that he was trying to communicate that without big money, it's damned hard to win elections in this country.	1
1	&gt;“Imagine this. Just imagine this,” the Congressman said. “Barack Obama goes down as the president who vetoed the most bills and in the succeeding election cost his party another election.”  He's also way off base about vetoes:  [here's a link to presidential veto counts.  President Obama has so far vetoed 4 bills](http://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/vetoCounts.htm)	1

0	Good thing he doesnt have a chance. Say what you want but an admitted socialist has no place in american politics.	1
0	Yes, but I don't think at the same scale and not really in /r/politics although during election season you'll see it.  The Democrats seem to understand this better and play the game all the time.	1
1	Don't compromise out of fear &amp; two-party brainwashing.  If Sanders deserves your vote, give it to him, regardless of primary outcomes.	1
0	Uh, he's saying stuff to get elected. And when he does, he goes back on his promises. There.	1
1	A big problem is middle-class flight, when neighborhoods start to lose jobs, or rise in crime, those with the means (usually white people) leave and go elsewhere.	1
0	He has no chance of winning the nomination, and these Buzzfeed top 6 lists do nothing but give false hope to the pot-smoking teens of Reddit.	1
0	It's cute how you think Sanders has a chance.	1
1	And what effect do you think moving them to more of a salaried/bonus situation and less of being slaves to the insurance industry would have?  I have heard more than one doctor complain one of the worst part of the job is having to do what insurance will allow/pay for rather than what he thinks is right for the patient.   And I don't remember most general practitioners being massively overworked until HMOs started becoming the way of medical care in the U.S. which forced them to shuffle patients through like cattle.	1
1	There is nothing to stop him from taking the money and then doing nothing for them once he wins. That only matters to politicians who care about being reelected. It would make him seem like he might though which his goes against his image.	1
1	I'm British and I'm more excited for American politics than our own thanks to Bernie Sanders.  The main quote to take away from that interview was, "If the banks are too big to fail, they're too big to exist".  Excellent stuff.	1
1	Just because he won't endorse or support a billionaire's Super PAC donation for his campaign doesn't mean it can't happen anyway without his approval. PACs are independent of his campaign and anyone has the ability to donate.	1
0	No person smart enough to make billions of dollars would give Bernie money.	1

1	i don't have time to read through the whole thing. do you mind quoting the pertinent info that got you to the 13.4%?	1
1	"Meme" originally referred to any concept or belief which can spread through a society. "Bernie Sanders is worthy of my volunteer work" is a meme, which supporters should try to make as virulent as possible.	1

I refuse to see how you show that the police are racist at looking at black people as criminals, by being black and looting and destroying.    I know your white guilt is strong, but black people can be assholes too, and in a community that is 60% black, that means that of the 20% of people that are going to loot and destroy, the majority will be black.	1

Their is no independence under socialism. Socialism is about putting power into the hands of a few. Our founders set up a government that was designed to keep power spread thin. Power is dangerous. I consumes individuals with too much of it. Those in leadership positions have turned American children away from God. They have chosen to make US enemies of righteousness.	1

0	Renewables.  Got it.  Exactly what I expected.  If they were economically viable, they wouldn't be "alternative".  They also kill more people than nuclear.  You seem to prefer the idea of powering the world on unicorns tears, though, so don't let those pesky facts get in the way of your preconceived notions and idealism.  For the record, I am a renewable proponent.  But the tech and manufacturing aren't there yet.  Nuclear is 100% necessary *now*.	1
0	I guess no need for a trial since you've already deemed them guilty. So much for "innocent"until proven guilty.	1
1	I'm voting entirely on the basis of two issues in the next election cycle:  1. Protecting civil liberties by ending domestic spying  1. Remove the corrupting influence of money through campaign finance reform.  Mr. Sanders, you've got my vote.	1
1	&gt; Most of the discussion on the right has been about failed Democratic policies in these cities for the last 50 years.   Yes, as a cudgel to slam Democrats.  Now I'd be willing to accept that if they had a solution. They have a solution, right?	1
0	After seeing this blatant injustice, we obviously need equal pay for equal work legislation for men.	1
0	This is really great to see another post from here at the top again. I really hope we as a community can keep a Bernie Sanders related post at the top of ALL for months to come.	1
1	Because he has been lauded as "unelectable" yet in day one he raised more money than his republican counterparts. The PEOPLE want Bernie, the average donation was $45 and I'm proud to say I put in double that. Let's keep it up and get the man the funds he needs to win this.	1
1	He has a mixed gun record. Wants to ban ar15s and clips with more than 10 rounds in it. That is where most people on reddit will have a problem.	1
1	There's a difference between a difficult sacrifice and knowingly fucking yourself.  The next president is going to be responsible for several Supreme Court appointments, and the Republican Party is at an all-time low in terms of having trustworthy candidates.  I'd rather see Sanders than Clinton, sure, but I'd rather see Clinton than any Republican candidate that's been floated so far.	1
0	The key here is sustaining the momentum. He's not an attention whore and he doesn't go around simply saying stuff that people want to hear. That'll make it tougher for him to get publicity.   Spreading his message is one of the biggest things his supporters can do over the next few months.	1
1	You cannot sell your integrity to 30,000 people who each donate $50, but you can sell your integrity to 1 guy/company that donates millions. Unfortunately that's how the system in US works politicians need money to campaign.	1
1	To be fair, that money doesn't disappear. A large part of it is returned to the economy because it is spent on US Defense contractors, military pay, etc...  With that said, I think that our choice to partake in a virtually continuous war in the middle east has been terrible for both our country economically and the regions stability.	1
1	Ah I see. So the question then becomes how likely do you think it is that a major politician who is fairly well-respected would attempt a lie of that sort when it could very easily backfire and when they are in a few months going to have to actually release all the actual data anyways which would show if they had lied? You seem to be underestimating by a lot how much paperwork and filing is involved in running federal level campaigns and how much Sanders would have to lose in this context.	1
0	Don't worry, the judge will still find a way to throw out the case. Can't have them blackies thinking they can get justice /s	1
1	Can we just perpetually keep Bernie Sanders posts at the top of Reddit for the next year and half? This is not the false prophet that Obama was. Sanders has much stronger words than Obama had when he was running, and the voting history to back it up. He's also an independent running on the Democratic ticket, not a true Dem. This is our man! I'm going to volunteer for a presidential campaign for the first time ever, I have so much faith in this guy (Is it faith if it's based on evidence?)	1
0	As a modded you own nothing. You are using someone else's IP. You shouldn't be able to earn money. It's no different than what Jroc did on his rap albums.	1

1	Me too. Can't wait to caucus up :)	1
1	That was exactly how the establishment destroyed him - by smearing him and getting all the mindless sheep follow their lead.  Ross Perot received death threats, and the mindless sheep didn't care.  Bernie Sanders will also get smeared and defamed, and again the mindless sheep will be there to support the establishment.	1
1	Yeah, but this is utterly insane.	1
1	What blows my mind is that Christians didn't always (and not all do now) view the world through such an infantile lens.  Many great philosophers and scientists of the old world were Christians trying to reconcile the lessons of the Bible with the observable truth of the world around them.  Recently, that's been turned on it's head, and now they just deny the world around them and insist that ALL truth lay in the ramblings of a bunch of iron age nomads.	1
1	And this is how you stop this type of shit from happening in the future.  It may end in an acquittals but it forces the cops to be held accountable for their actions and will hopefully stop this bullshit	1

0	dear canada,  no thanks.	1
0	You seem to miss that Clinton being a woman is almost a shoe in for the vote.  She will beat Sanders as he alienates a lot of the more conservative left.  A lot of america is center mass, like Obama and Clinton.    I completely agree with you, though as of late there is a loft of Dems calling out other Dems for not being progressive enough.  This inner party squabbling is only going to hurt the party long term.	1

1	Taxation boils down to one simple thing ---- it can spur an economy by spending money that others don't want to let go.  If people paying more are job creators, that means they have businesses and will see this money return to them if they are doing right.  In a sense this IS capitalism, just with a little nudge.	1

1	Why? You can easily google it.  "Hillary is terrific," she said when asked again if she would endorse her in the event Clinton makes a run for the Democratic nomination.  I'm not sure why Reddit thinks that Hillary is so conservative. She doesn't say she will do conservative things. And her record does not show her doing conservative things.  On the liberal to conservative scale, Hillary ranks 11. Bernie Sanders ranks 1, and Coburn ranks 101. Hillary is FAR from a Republican. http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/31/1374629/-Hillary-Clinton-Was-the-11th-Most-Liberal-Member-of-the-Senate  EDIT: Just reread my original comment.

0	&gt;Bernie Sanders' track record on civil liberties is impeccable.  It's not impeccable.  He wants to ban the sale of the most popular rifle in the United States, and impose criminal restrictions on ergonomic and safety features on guns (like pistol grips and barrel shrouds).	1
0	Yeah the government should really step in and protect the most vulnerable among us from parents who are intent on ushering them toward death.   We should be doing all we can to save lives rather than letting parents end them based on their personal feelings.   Except abortion though,  in that case we don't care about that life.	1

1	What an incredibly poignant response.	1
1	&gt; I just hope the liberal vote isn't split  That's the whole reason to run as a Democrat. It avoids splitting the liberal vote in the general election.	1
0	But this still means nothing, honey. I'm sorry but this is just hot air. Nearly ANY politician will say keep jobs in America and strengthen the middle class. Lots of the Democratic Party and some republicans are criticizing the TPP, which is what I assume you mean by your choice of the words free trade. You can read more and present points with substance, and actually sway people in your direction instead of just saying "oh this guy is just really amazingly good and handsome."	1
1	Regardless what you think of the media. Sanders getting elected is actually a very long shot. So don't get tied up hating the messenger and ignore the message.   Okay so what do we do if we accept the truth of the message. There are 2 responses. Get discouraged and give up. Or keep your focus realistic and redouble your effort. I would like to see a Sanders presidency as much as anyone here I suspect. But the reason he doesn't stand a chance isn't just because the media says so. Don't rove yourself in to loosing.	1

0	&gt;  Now tell me about how Abe Lincoln was the most racist man of the 19th century.   Well, he wasn't *not* racist, if that's what you're asking. I certainly wouldn't support your claim that he was most racist though, that's as silly as you calling Obama literally Hitler.    You're a little heavy on the hyperbole, is all.	1
1	As a health insurance sales agent for the better part of a year I agree that single payer is the best way to go.  Simple. Insurance works to minimize loss to an individual by spreading the risk among premium payers. The bigger the pool the less the premium payment so it doesn't make sense from an effeciency standpoint to have small separate pools. One big pool for all will be the best.	1
1	He has repeatedly spoken out against the TPP.  A trade deal that would give corporations a lot more leeway to fuck people over with the power to sue anyone who tries to reign in their abuse.	1
0	The reason he wants to avoid negative attacks is because Hillary will win the primary and doesn't need unnecessary attacks on her that would damage sanders relationship to the dem party.	1
0	it's not clear that bernie will either. obama pledged to do plenty of things that he pulled a total 180 on. (and before someone cites republicans in congress, republicans didn't make president obama refuse to call the amernian genocide "genocide" like candidate obama promised to).  people should be weary of a candidate who has lots of sounds bytes but very little in the way of actual legislative accomplishments.	1

0	As a liberal, It's because she has proven that she doesn't align with almost any of my views. Hillary is just another Obama and although they may seem better than the insane republicans they throw out, they still serve the same people.

0	The fact is that Hillary has broken no laws, nor has she even acted suspiciously. You can cry all you want about the Clinton Foundation, but they are about as pored over as any institution ever and *they are a charitable organization.*  You really must be scared of this strong woman. Personally, I don't like her personality, but she's miles above any of the GOP candidates. I am in the bag for Bernie and if/when he's primaried out, I will probably switch to Jill Stein...  But it's interesting that this early on in the race the GOP shills are already grasping at straws because their candidates are so lackluster.	1

Break a law quietly in your own home, one many of the police officers themselves are willing to break, and you're not in much danger.  If you were to poll most people I know on how much data they'd pirated over the years their answer would be in terrabytes.  And I bet that number decreased with the invention of Netflix. I used to pirate movies all the time, now I Netflix.  We literally moved the market via theft. We changed an industry via crime.	1

The point is that when you don't **pay** for an intern to do work, they must make due by other means, which is usually the bank of mom and dad (and no, the $2,000 need based stipend will not cover 4 months in NYC... the very fact that there is a "need based stipend" speaks volumes to the types of folks who are able to apply!)	1

0	Reagan was practically moderate.   Just to name a few things he gave actual amnesty to 3 million illegal aliens.  Federal spending also ballooned under him.  He raised taxes 7 out of the eight years he was in office.  The only reason he is considered the right-wing national treasure is because he is one of the few Republican presidents whose semi-right-wing policies didn't completely fuck up the country.  But that's not entirely true.  Unemployment was higher under him than during the most recent recession and its effects lasted longer too.  There's also Iran Contra, the Taliban and bunch of other bullshit as well.	1

0	That's all that will happen here as well. There isn't a shred of evidence to support any of these charges. At the very least there is enough reasonable doubt to make this case completely unwinnable at trial. They clearly charged so many individuals in the hope of getting some of them to testify against the others in exchange for having their charges dropped. So long as the cops stick together none of them will spend another day in jail. It's only if they start backstabbing each other that any of these charges might stick.	1

0	Yeah that's totally absurd.   Anyone who knows anything about finance knows it was Clinton's fault.   Although, Obama *did* pick Larry Summers as his chief econ adviser. The Clinton admin economists who are responsible for the collateralized debt obligation-credit default swap bubble that led to the 2008 crash are Robert Rubin and his mini-me, Summers.	1

0	1 in 40 Americans probably won't even support him, let alone know who he is unfortunately.	1
1	I think the catch depends on whether or not you believe there is already an institutionalized redistribution of wealth occurring. Bernie believes there is already such system flowing money to the top and he wishes to change that by creating (and destroying) policy to stop that flow.  If you feel that things are already fair, then you would see those policies as decreasing fairness and institutionalizing flow from the top down.	1

0	Seriously, watching reddit ejaculate over this whole Bernie Sanders thing is so gross. The dude is never going to win and he's clearly just there to soak up all your votes. So when it comes to election time he endorses the front runner of his party and then all of you end up voting for them or don't vote at all. It's nice to hope but be realistic and save your money, children.   Edit: I'm all for a change to the two party system but when you're turning down big money because of "ideals" then you're clearly not in it to win it.	1

1	If you think Sanders favors centrally planned economics in any meaningful sense of the term, I fear you are very much mistaken.  He's certainly not a Leninist, and in fact isn't much of a socialist. He's a social democrat, in the Scandanavian sense.	1

0	exactly, it has not increased.   And I am sorry, I get why African Americans dislike cops but look at the stats for the number of cops hurt / shot by them compared to other races.... Then you have riots like this. Is it all that surprising why the distrust goes both ways.	1
0	As Tip O'Neil said, "All politics is local." Hillary was the 11th most liberal Senator because she represented New York, one of the most liberal states in America. Had she represented a state like Arkansas for example, I would venture to guess her voting record would have been at least slightly more conservative.	1

1	Murder is more serious than homicide.  However, murder usually requires both intent and malice.  Depraved Indifference is designed for scenarios where deliberate intent cannot be proven but the conduct described is still egregious and has a predictable result.      An example could be given of a person who decided to throw some cinder blocks off an overpass into the traffic below.  He more than likely could never be proven that he intended and prepared to murder a specific random passerby explicitly, but he could be proven to know that his actions endangered lives and could still be convicted on a murder charge, as opposed to a lesser manslaughter charge.	1
1	It doesn't matter if he is or isn't influenced.  It becomes a talking point that can be used to discredit him.  No one would believe he had a SuperPAC or took large donations from corporations and didn't allow it to influence him.  It's like the TV/movie cliche of arresting a gangster without evidence, then letting them go free and clear.  They are suddenly suspect to their allies because "Hey, why did the police just let you go?"	1
1	Too busy calling both sides equal	1
0	Irrelevant.  Neocons and Wall Street banksters don't mind gay marriage. In fact, many of them are homos themselves   And just look at the spectacle of Big Corporations threatening to boycott Indiana. I'm afraid corporate doesn't mind gay rights at all.	1

0	I'm actually surprised you think it's so obvious. Structurally, the government is the same. People haven't changed, human nature is the same. We had an arguably more liberal president then than we do now. Sure, social mores are different, but that stuff changes all the time. What major differences between the government of the US then and the current government are there?	1
1	Do these idiots have anything serious to run on other than "Obama is bad?"	1
1	&gt; the Obama administration, in conjunction with the U.S. military and Wal-Mart, is planning to impose martial law on much of the country.   Wal-Mart??   Obama &amp;  fucking Wal-Mart??  I guess Wal-Mart lures you in the front door with **LOW LOW** prices, takes your gun away, and forces you out the back door and into one of the many shipping containers and truck you off to the FEMA camps where you will be fed to the reptilian aliens.  amirite??	1

1	More exposure results in more votes. More money allows for more exposure. If Sanders can't get his message out, or if it gets lost amidst the media blitz of others, then he won't win. He's already fighting a massive uphill battle to get recognized, and his demographic isn't exactly known for hitting the polls. Not having enough money could easily lose him the race.	1

1	VP is not "useless," but it's not a placement that Warren would be useful in. If I were Bernie, I would ask John Kerry.

There is no corruption too deep, so why not?	1
1	I wish people would not vote on stupid shallow reasons like "old and crazy hair." I mean really, if we're going there, don't vote for Hillary, she looks like Beetlejuice!	1
1	He can still win.  We just need to give him money. The worker of the US need to give him money so he can fight what he believes in	1
1	It's not like it is some wild and crazy idea either. Almost every other industrialized country has it.   Americans just tend to be ignorant and misinformed about it. Unfortunately.	1
0	Ok, I usually hate democrats. But I'm starting to like this guy.	1
0	Bunch of fucking communists coming out of the woodwork!   No surprise on Reddit.   Easy to be a commie when you live in mommy and daddy's basement and mooch free shit off them all day long.	1
0	Honestly I fail to see why that is unethical. You are saying that market-based healthcare is discriminating against the poor? Sure. Unethical? I don't think so.   It costs a lot of money to invest in advanced medical equipment and pharmaceutical research. Keeping the healthcare sector capitalistic maintains the profit incentive necessary to advance medical care.	1
1	But if he does win then it'll set the precedent for a massive overhaul of how elections are funded.	1
1	Still a message I'd rather get behind.	1
1	Am I the only one that feels like this is just kiddy table politics that won't matter in the least? I guess I'm just the thrice beaten dog.	1

1	He (and Hillary too) are going to get called it anyway, might as well start embracing it and telling people what it means.	1
1	It's selfish.  That's really how you describe conservatives, selfish.  They only care if it happens to them.	1
0	Speaking as a fellow Ohioan, I have to say that Kasich is scary and should be taken extremely seriously as a potential presidential candidate.	1

0	You realize this is the same argument that Liberals use to discredit the Patriot Act.  When you make someone accountable, you get transparency.  Take away the initials EPA and replace them with CIA or FBI.  Federal Agencies should not be able to operate without accountability of proof.	1
1	Yeah, I basically don't trust Clinton to be genuine about anything.  I'll vote for her in the general if she wins the nomination, but purely because I don't trust *any* Republican politician.  Sanders better pick a good VP candidate if he wins the nomination. He's older now than John McCain was in 2008, and there was concern then about McCain's age (and the fact that he picked Sarah "I'd be good at foreign policy because I can see Russia from my house" Palin as his VP).	1

0	Yeah which is a bit disheartening because I'm 100% pro-nuclear power. He's still my favorite candidate though.	1
1	Yet he seems to also be a true believer in the ideology.  He's hard to figure out.	1
1	You could write a fucking book on all the problems and implications of needing a victim to be perfect before caring about the underlying injustices of their death.	1
1	Well shit. I'm actually starting to like a presidential candidate.	1
0	Did you read the article?  They aren't denying any science.  They simply want the EPA to publish their findings.  Why is that such a horrible bill?	1
1	And that's a pretty big deal. Obama was still a very young politician when he started getting the spotlight on him for the presidency. Sanders has a long career, and more than that, he has a consistent career in his voting record. That's pretty damn hard to find.	1
0	Believe me, I hate it too.   I would rather see four parties. Center and far left and right.	1

1	**Bernie Sanders** is the only serious presidential candidate in America...  As he is the only candidate that calls out Citizens United for what it is; The legalization of bribery and extortion of politicians, and the blatant corruption of American "Democracy" by moneyed interests.  We need a President that tells truth to power and money, not one that bows down to it.    A vote for a **republican** is a vote **for Oligarchy**.   A vote for **Hillary may be** a vote **for Oligarchy-lite**.   A vote for **Bernie is** a vote **against Oligarchy** and a vote to take money out of politics.  The choice is simple as fuck.	1

0	Well you gotta hand it to them at least they showed up to their state primaries and elected themselves as delegates in an attempt to take over the national convention.  what are you going to do during your state's primary season?  antagonize right-libertarians online?  Seriously maybe people on the right are "weird in real life" but at least they aren't lazy	1
1	Fuck em.  They are only losing subscribers to actual news.  I mean, they are developing shows on the news network.  They are interesting shows and are developed like 60 minutes type news programs, so they are pretty good.  But they are trying to find themselves again since there is no war to cover anymore.	1
1	He has done two, you can look them up on his subreddit /r/SandersForPresident	1
1	President Obama has done a pretty solid job as POTUS, I would say. I think history will probably look on him favorably. He's not my main guy, but I wouldn't be upset if he got a third term.	1
0	Bernie Sanders: Forever pimpin, never slippin, that's how it is.	1
1	Where does it say in the Constitution and Bill of Rights that Anonymous speech should be free?   It is not a component of free speech.  Free is just free of government censorship. Money is not speech. Money is work made capital via fiat.   The problem is we have already heard most of this and then some. It will be full of the usually empty buzzwords like "free speech", improper use of "logical fallicy" claims, and using appeals to be open on arguments that are long defeated by the arguing parties own data long ago.	1

0	I'm not a pure libertarian. I don't think any single ideology answers all the questions. I do, however, lean heavily towards libertarianism,.   Regarding healthcare specifically, I think that a nationalized system is the best way. A single payer system, while not perfect, does solve all of the most important problems with that particular niche.   There's no way for the healthcare workers and the people being treated to enter into an equitable and informed agreement when emergencies arise and the only option is to render services and hope for the best. Both sides get screwed in the current system.	1
0	I'm interested as to what basis this statement has.   A simple google search will tell you that Hillary was noted for considerable accomplishments as a senator.   http://correctrecord.org/the-points/attack-right-wing-ignores-hillary-clintons-achievements-as-senator/	1

Telling people that they think they can actually live without big brother watching over them that they are uninformed, immature polyannas living in a fantasy land.   The "real world" is big and dangerous and you need the NSA to keep you safe!	1
1	How does the old saying go?  Something about "reality is what's left when you stop believing in it."  Edit: I suppose the downvote is deserved, as it is neither old nor a saying.  I found it:  &gt; “Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.”  --  Philip K. Dick	1

0	Not wanting Ted Cruz to be President is as racist as everyone said not wanting Obama to be President was.	1
1	At this point he's got my vote, but I have learned never to trust a politician completely, no matter how genuine they may seem.	1
1	&gt;voted in lower numbers in 2012  Yeah, because the guy they elected seemingly renigged on much of the Hope and Change he platformed on. Disillusion can happen.  50 years ago social media wasn't even a thing. Hell, 5 years ago it didn't have the impact it does now. You're insane if you think young people will have less effect now than in the past.	1
0	this is all well documented fact, buddy.	1
0	Well let's not lie about the situation. He made eye contact with the officers and then bolted which is cause for the officer to purse and search, upon search they found an illegal switchblade. It's not like he was just standing around. That being said he should not of been given a rough ride or deserved to die. But by no means was this man a saint. It's important that we tell the whole truth here not hyperbole.	1
0	He's been on the front page of the internet for days now and 1% of 1% of the American population care enough to give him money. Impressive, but it's not giving me a lot of hope for his campaign.   The guy is in reality less electable than Ron Paul.	1
1	Until you realize that the donations given to republican Super PACs absolutely dwarfed what Bernie got :(	1
1	He's running as democrat, so be sure to switch before the primaries. And please vote in the primaries. Every little bit counts when running against the giant Clinton machine.	1
1	Relavant xkcd: https://xkcd.com/1019/	1
0	But, if the overall average wage decreases as a result of offshoring, is it really a net positive? More people being paid less is good?   I don't see lower prices as a canonical "good thing" for consumers if ethics are thrown out the window. Watch John Oliver's recent 'fashion' video for a case in point.	1

0	And just think you made your political decision based on a flimsy idea of who this person actually is without doing any real research whatsoever. Congratulations your now a democrat.	1
0	Or perhaps they're both for the people. Hillary is more at the center and Bernie is more towards the left. While I would prefer someone to the left, I wouldn't claim that Hillary isn't for the people or doesn't care about people as some here are.	1
1	Yeah, look what happened to Ron Paul.	1
0	If we enforced our immigration laws and deported them like we are supposed to that wouldn't happen.	1
0	It's definitely possible. People who enjoy controlling others and having power over others would naturally be drawn to a position of authority that inherently elevates them above their peers (like being a police officer), so maybe. But either way, there are pleeennnty of shit people who aren't cops, my only point.	1
1	I don't think that will be the case now. Reddit's userbase has grown so large and varied that it'd be impossible.	1
1	Yes... we must forward sanders and inflate lesser social media's with Sanders... this can start the movement!!!	1

1	Not sure what you're saying.  I'm saying if they get off or get reduced sentencing, the riots are going to be worse.  All the more reason to prosecute aggressively.	1
0	I think if you define crazy in terms of distance from the political center, Paul and Sanders are crazy. I could cite Hong Kong for libertarian policies in the manner that you do with Europe for more democratically socialist. Just because a policy exists elsewhere doesn't make it less crazy. So here are two candidates, not loved by the mainstream media, shunned by their parties and major league financial agents, who's supporters view them as deities. You just think his pipe dream will be the best smoke, because you agree with his stances, just as I did with Ron Paul in 2012. Principle&gt;Pragmatism. (np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/34fy03/can_we_not_ron_paul_this_guy/	1
0	What's more important to you? Electing Sanders or keeping people who deny science out of the white house?  I'm as big a Sanders fan as anyone. I identify as a socialist myself.  But we are screwed if by some miracle he were to win the nomination over Hillary. I have many issues with her that are too long to post here, but she is the only shot democrats have at the white house.	1
1	That wouldn't be a good ticket.  Sanders would need someone younger, more charismatic, and with different experience.  Perhaps a young Governor or Mayor.	1
0	I've heard claims such as yours but just haven't seen those positive changes on a personal level. Any problems with your insurance plan are amplified because now the provider and the Marketplace point the finger at each other, so figuring out a billing issue is a massive undertaking almost on par with passing this legislation in the first place (joking).  Also, my wife is in medical school and assists very low-income families. One woman barely makes any money and lives in a terrible neighborhood, yet she pays $400 a month for coverage! For HERSELF!	1
0	If Ron Paul didn't run on the republican ticket he would have had a much better chance in getting young people to give a shit.	1

0	Think about what controlling for those variables does.  Of *course* no one gets smarter or dumber by affiliating with a political party.  It implies that Democrats have a larger proportion of scientifically illiterate people due to those variables.	1
1	Heck, maybe we should get a few decent programmers to write a solid video game app as a fundraising tool.  I'm a pretty decent writer, so I can try to help in some way along those lines.  i'm not against doing everything we can.  I'm just cynical.	1

0	You're so deluded you probably believe that.  People. or in your example "white people" don't leave just cause. They leave to get away from the very same people that tear down a city. And it goes all the way to the top. Bad management who dont seek to improve the city, but to keep people desperate and line their own pockets.	1
1	&gt; Cops without body cameras, cars without dash cams, the ability for Hillary Clinton's correspondence to go entirely unchecked as Secretary of State.  These aren't really covered under what the NSA does. Body cams for cops and knowing what government officials are doing are good, as they're holding public officials accountable, but the NSA is in the business of recording any and all private information on citizens - a completely different subject.	1
1	There's an issue that doesn't get enough attention. Even if jobs are created, many of them are typically low wage, thereby not really doing anything to improve the tax base.	1
0	PERFECT EXAMPLE!!  After 50 years of almost unbroken Democrat leadership (see a pattern?), New York City was considered one of the world's most dangerous cities with sky high crime and murder rates. It was a pretty gross place to live too.   Then a Republican (Rudy Giuliani) was elected mayor in 1994 and NYC has since been completely transformed.   Thanks for bringing that up!	1
0	Rationality left the minute he said he was in it to win.  Fortunately however, you don't need a structural winning campaign to bring essential messages to a public stage. but anyone who claims this is anything more than that is taking a dump on the sense of honesty that should be the backbone of the campaign.	1
1	Her favourite book is the bible, though!	1
1	Donating is a brilliant idea. Sanders has already announced he is not going to raise money with a SuperPAC....so he's not going to have billionaires with unlimited amounts of cash to give his campaign.

1	Nothing would recapture my faith in US govt more than a Sanders/Warren White House, but they are both much alike. The slot of VP has become a marketing ploy to attract the party's more hard-leaning voters. I love the idea of two bank-busters making it into the White House on grass-roots dimes. But Clinton could use Warren more as a veep, to attract the more extreme left that believes Clinton's too centrist.	1
1	More than 80 clinics closed, that only provided well woman care and (the point) contraceptives.

"Christian conservatives". Fascists.	1

0	I am not saying it is crazy to raise minimum wage, my main point, once again is that even if they raise the wage to 15/hr, when the worker can't get 40hrs/week it doesn't help.  Most definitely someone with kids will have it way harder, but dual income, child support, family support, or government aide should help a bit.  And for any middle aged person in a minimum wage job, I feel very sympathetic.  At that age, you SHOULD have somehow aquired some non entry level skills.  Anyways, it is totally possible to LIVE not comfortably or like a baller, but to LIVE on minimum wage.	1

Only then will we have be able to live in a free paradise that we all long for.	1
0	He's a bit kooky, but how is he racist?	1
1	I'm all for Sanders, he has my vote. But even if he were to win the presidency, he's only president. He is still going to have to fight tooth and nail against billionaire bankrolled senate and congress.  Don't forget those votes too. If you want real representation by the people, for the people, get corporations out of office in all branches of government.	1
0	Except that Sanders is window dressing for the Democrats to kthe  attract intelligent voters' attention.  Bait and switch. Hillary is the golden candidate, and she will be the "Democratic Leadership Commitee's" choice. If she dies during the campaign, they will present Biden in her place.  Candidates whom the majority of Americans could morally support will have no more chance of winning than Robert Kennedy had in 1968.	1
1	don't be rediculous.  Of course we americans deserve proper leaders.  The current status quo is horse shit.  We've deserved better for forty years.	1

Build your message and response from there. If you're good enough, people on /r/politics will support you and spread your word. You have the power. Shoot, you can even turn down super PACs and just have reddit send you a few bucks a month because anonymous people on reddit love and support your message, and they want to promote you. Put ads online, on TV, on the radio. You can do it.	1

1	Earth science is a core mission of NASA.  That's why NASA does so much Climate Change research.  The oil industry/Koch bros want to kill anything the gov't does toward that end to minimize the public's knowledge of the truth and the possible use of any evidence to back anti-green house gas regulations (say, by the EPA which has been in their crosshairs for years).  Remember, the Koch bros. are funding the GOP election to the tune of nearly a BILLION dollars.  But hey, the parties are the same.  So, stay home.  Don't vote.  /s	1
1	Dude, I'm taking about time travel for the purpose of deliberately fucking over the country... What part of this screams "in-depth analysis of the factors attributing to the 2008 economic collapse"? What drives you to be so defensive over Bush that you rush to defend his name over an absurd joke poking fun at Cruz and his absurd statements?	1
1	You keep saying that the Feds should give "back" the land to a state that never owned it in the first place.   I think that's part of the conservative propaganda. Take out the word "back" and it's just red states begging for more handouts.	1

1	This is a perfect example of everything that is wrong with this country right now. This guy would rather wage his "war" on Obama rather than work work across the aisle in any capacity. When your only reason for not confirming someone is that you don't like the guy who appointed him it's time to resign and just go home. Politics has become akin to a sports rivalry where people just root for their favorite team. It's stupid and it's not how it's supposed to work.	1

1	&gt; billionaires start making contributions through his online site  They'd be limited to the same 2.6k limit as everyone else.  But you're right that Bernie can't stop someone from forming a PAC on his behalf. It might undercut his stance and be counter productive, though. He'd be instantly labeled a hypocrite.	1
1	I do think he has a chance, however small it may be.	1
1	This. Bernie himself has said many times that people need to get involved. He knows he will be outspent and that the media won't take him seriously. But he believes, based on his recent travels around the country, that there is great potential for a true grassroots movement, and that is what he needs in order to have a real chance. The key is that people need to get actively involved.	1

1	I see a complete breakdown of trust in the police in the US.  It is the job of the police to make sure that trust exists. It is their fault and their fault only that it doesn’t. If you have a monopoly over violence making sure you are trusted is one of your most important jobs, one that police in the US constantly fails at.  And all they do is whine and blame others. Really. It’s comical. Making sure you are trusted is your job, it’s the job of the one legally wielding the baton and the gun.	1

Someone who disapproves of some of the actions we have taken? Unless there's someone who runs for the literal physical destruction of the U.S. or on physically harming Americans. I don't understand how a politician could be Anti-American. Or to say if someone has painted you a picture of someone's policies as Anti-American it's probably just an attempt to dissuade you from viewing those policies out of fear of you agreeing which them and threatening their bottom line. I would be Anti-those-Americans.	1
1	I'm fairly certain you understood the point of my post, but you completely failed to address it. I'll ask again, with just a tad bit less snark.... What makes one religion anymore legitimate than another? Every religion is convinced that their story is right and everyone else's is wrong, so what makes any one legitimate than any other? With regard to religious freedom, why should my sincerely held beliefs be treated any different than yours?	1

Also, Hillary has not disclosed the money she has earned in that same time period. (Likely to be more, but she doesn't want the people to know she is backed by the banks)	1
0	why are you obsessed with "everyone"? It works for 95% of people. That's good enough. The rest can get roommates or move. We're not basing our policies on exceptions.

You're not allowed to bitch about it anymore.	1

0	I'm not a1%er and that all sounds good to me.   Those Republican policies sure have made a mess of Baltimore.   They've been running Baltimore since 1967.  Oh wait, that has been liberal Democrats with liberal policies. Great schools, 99% of high school students graduating,  higher incomes for everyone, ... of course it's the exact opposite but Obama claims he "now"- just now -  has come up with the solution. It's "more money!" Does it change the fact that massive amounts of spending have done little in the war on poverty? Duh....	1
1	Sure, but one of his biggest platforms is climate change, and has been for a long time. It's not like he wants us all on fossil fuels. Think carbon caps, tax relief for solar power, tighter EPA restrictions, way fewer tax breaks for big oil. At least, as much as a President can help those things. He's been one of the biggest enemies of the keystone pipeline in congress.	1
1	For all real world purposes yes.  It's put into hedge fund securities, insurance hedges, and forex arbitration systems.  It keeps the assets mobile, untraceable, and outside any individual governments influence.  In a market that deals in purely virtual commodities, as a way to hoard about $20+ trillion of the worlds wealth.  It's the reason there are a hundred islands around the world with 12 drunk fisherman and a 'bank' moving a billion dollars a day.	1
0	Haha, this was genuinely hilarious. Without cause, he decides you're a kid. Then when you're much more experienced than he is, he calls you grandpa. The ironic part is that he was questioning your age, and all of his submissions are to video game and TV subs. What a clown. Haha	1
0	I'm just not going to support someone who has no chance in a general election.   His voting record on trade, reproductive rights, healthcare, and many other issues earn my profound respect, and I think he is a brave, brilliant man.   But we live in a country with people who believe that a President who is a fiscal moderate and a war hawk is a socialist.  Realistically speaking, Senator Sanders is going to be spending other people's money on a campaign that was doomed before it began.	1

0	Me too. Personally, I think there should be a cap on any contribution, whether personal or corporate (though corporate donations should be banned). As we all have but one vote, we should all have one amount to give. It's ridiculous that campaigns are business ventures now.    I'm glad I'm looking at things from the other side. You see the flaws in your own arguments and see your own biases.	1

0	&gt; This is where it has lead us. And THIS is not a good place. We need dramatic change. We need massive paradigm shifts.

Absolutely - but overall, particularly being an American, is pretty sweet to be honest.	1

1	When you cuff a man's arms and legs then drive him around for 40 minutes, while denying him medical care he repeatedly requested, without a seat belt, that's pretty culpable.

0	This *repeated* claim is simply untrue if you spend some time thinking through the economics of it.  https://www.economy.com/dismal/analysis/datapoints/253947/Government-Assistance-and-Work/  "Unfortunately, there is little basis to claim that most public assistance programs benefit employers. "  Also, if someone *really* believes this to be the case, why don't we eliminate these public assistance programs? Surely if they are just going mostly to help corporations, there would be not large outcry if they were taken away, since corporations will simply pay more...right?	1

That cannot happen in a homosexual marriage. Which spouse gets to see the child? By law it can only be one since two men and two women cannot naturally conceive. If you want to create parental rights simply by marriage, you would see straight couples ceasing to get married.	1

Police had said Gray was arrested for possessing a switchblade, but Mosby said Friday the knife in Gray's possession was not a switchblade and was lawful, and said officers "illegally arrested" Gray.  He was illegally arrested and killed.  I commend the State Attorney's office for uncovering the facts and not participating in a cover-up.  It's a shame that this course of action is not the norm.	1
1	Seriously, it was the top story on Google news, it's not just reddit.	1
0	Good on Bernie for making a big deal about not breaking campaign finance law! We should praise him for being exactly like every other presidential candidate since it is illegal to coordinate with SuperPACs as a candidate.	1

1	I hate the comparisons to Ron Paul. Please stop making them. Paul had numerous positions that did not survive having light shown on them. As soon as people saw them, they wrote him off. His failure was in part due to the "establishment", but a very large part was also his own positions.  Sanders should be broadcasting *all* of his positions to the country as often as he possibly can. His voting record and vision for the country really resonates with most (young) people. Paul's didn't past the surface.	1
0	Obviously. But do they need to? If all we're finding out is politician A and politician B are fiddling each other, then it would be better to remove surveillance to increase relations while reducing costs, or subverting those resources somewhere more beneficial.	1

Keep people poor so that they are willing to fight in our bullshit wars for a paycheck.    Keep people poor so that they are miserable and turn to Christianity.  We can use Christianity to manipulate them for votes.	1

From bush jr claiming god spoke to him, to Michelle Bachman just reinventing history, to Cruz and David duke ..jeez the list goes on forever..it is scary crazy. It's scrazy. it hasn't been about politics for a long time for them. It is about religious fundamentalism, racism, and fear-mongering..And somehow they are in charge...	1

0	That may be true, but Baltimore is predominately controlled by democrats so it's a pretty far stretch to blame republicans for what happened there.  I think the real problem is lack of police training/internal controls and the culture that lets them think they could get away with arresting someone without cause and then intentionally not putting a seatbelt on the guy.	1
1	Which worked out so well in China.	1
0	For one university, it's not the increase in students. It's the increase in student demand. If the demand hadn't spiked, then a university that raised their tuition would have a lot less students (all else equal). All those business majors are hired because A) schools don't know what else to spend all this new money on, and B) schools don't have shareholders to return excess cash to.	1

That'll have more effects than anything else. They are wealthy and there is nothing wrong in using your influence. Washington, Jefferson, Madison, FDR, JFK were all massively wealthy, and used a lot of soft money . The Koch brothers aren't household names outside of the politically in tune class of people. I dare you to find someone on the street who has any Idea what they look like or what their business does. This is political grandstanding at its worst.	1

1	This reminds me of the time I posted an article about how Mark Cuban doesn't approve of net neutrality and they removed my submission. Then I contacted the mods and asked why to get a 'we don't allow articles about specific individual people in /r/politics.' So I linked to a search within /r/politics which clearly demonstrated the hundreds of articles with "Mark Cuban" in the title currently posted. No response. Nice.  *Keep it liberal, or keep it off this sub.*	1

1	It's clearly a case of blaming the policies of the earlier president for one period and blaming the policies of the later president for the other. It's a shoddy, inconsistent argument.  &gt;How is this relevant?  If Carter is relevant in discussing 78-82, then Bush is relevant in discussing 08-12. Don't act like that's not obvious.	1

0	Exactly. I'm pretty fucking sick of being told that it's my fault nothing changes, because I don't vote in favor of everything staying the same.	1
0	You absolutely should. Like I told Asmatic below, Sanders brings some good stuff to the table that Clinton will be forced to address. I'm not saying you shouldn't vote for Sanders or help with his campaign, I'm saying you shouldn't go around saying that he has a realistic shot of winning the presidency or blaming his low poll numbers on "the media" or whatever scapegoat you want to use, when the reality is he's just not a statistically good candidate.	1
0	&gt; Let's face it...he has rebuilt America, and Americans are greatly benefiting. &gt;    Race riots and racial tensions, which seems to be getting worse, and fake economy, based on money $trillions in printing and artificially low interest rates creating a massive stock bubble that will destroy more of  the middle class, are nothing to brag about.	1

1	It's more that he's asking what this country could be, and quite frankly it's about god damn time.	2
1	It's deceptive because it's only showing large contributors. It's not showing all of her contributors. In total, Hillary received far more in small donations from retired folks than she did from Wall Streeters:  https://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/indus.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00000019	2

1	This is ugly, oversimplified, poorly worded, biased, and flat out wrong. One example: Hillary doesn't support affordable college? Pretty sure she's saying that she wants to make college free.   Sincerely,  A Sanders supporter.	2
0	You suspect incorrectly. Read the article, then we'll talk.	2
1	&gt;there's absolutely no one in the GOP that can win a debate against Bernie.  Probably, but the GOP wins popularity contests with one-liners ("That answer's as clear as Boston Harbor!") over content and besides the media will tell them who won, if they look at all.	2

0	You're failing to support yours by offering a comparable situation. You argued if Bernie wins the primary, he'll lose the general. I asked, "Based on what?" You said past candidates. Then you offered no comparable candidate (a liberal democrat who wins in the primary but loses the general). I didn't even ask for a candidate from a recent election, yet you've failed to provide any evidence for your ridiculous claim. Have a nice day, moron. I'm done.  You may want to read up on who burden of proof works in argument.	2
0	The difference between Hillary and Sanders is that Hillary will be on the ballot in November, 2016.  Sanders won't. When the Democratic primaries start up next year, he won't be seen as a viable candidate.   Sanders' role is to generate interest in the race. They're looking for you to react exactly the way you just did: getting excited about the political process.	2

1	Same data set on opensecrets shows that HRC got $82,000 from the Plumbers Union, $43,000 from the Operator Engineers Union, and about $40,000 from the Laborers Union. This graphic is a little "apples to oranges" given the different scales of their previous campaigns.	2

0	&gt;Gay marriage? She's all for it,   Now that it's popular enough she is.  I don't think it's vary admirable that she waited for public opinion to come around before she threw her support behind it.	2
0	Sorry, that was republican only. Regardless, all of them say around 6-8% of total likely voters were undecided. So the distinction between eligible voters and likely voters is still irrelevant.	2
1	"See I did it and I didn't need shitty obamacare"	2
1	but is she TRULY for gay marriage?  Whatever the fuck that means.  Does Bernie Sanders officiate gay weddings or something?  For me, the most damning thing about Hilary is how she literally organized protests against Vietnam when she was younger, but then voted for the Iraq War.  That vote was either her eviscerating her beliefs to pander to popular opinion or admitting she doesn't actually believe anything at all.  I'd vote for her over Paul and Cruz, but I'm hoping there is a serious Democratic challenger.	2

1	He's been fighting for these things for a while. Warren supporters have more in common with Sanders than they do Clinton.	4
1	It dares us to take an honest look at our traditional rhetoric, and compare that to the real, physical reality that we are suffering through on a daily basis.	4
1	Yeah.  I'd also be interested to slip in a military designation and see how much that offsets other "disadvantages."	4
1	Why? Bernie is legitimately a good, mainstream candidate I like, and he has a record and experience unlike Stein.	4
1	The minority party is always against gerrymandering, until they're not.	4

1	Our poor are not the envy of Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Canada, Denmark, ......	4
1	Why? The Green Party refuses to run serious campaigns, even Ralph Nader (whom I love to death) just went around making speeches and never built up actual infrastructure for his campaign. Bernie Sanders at least has a chance, albeit a small one. Voting Green is as useful to anybody as saying "fuck voting" and becoming an armchair progressive. They also have some positions that are just shitty, like their support for homeopathy.	4

0	The headline reads "Ted Cruz: Gay people should stop demanding equal rights because ISIS would murder them". Note the connecting word "because". Stop complaining or ISIS will get you. No that's not it. I agree with your analysis of what Cruz is saying and means, unfortunately you didn't write the Salon piece. The headline is misleading and inflammatory and heaven knows we've had enough of that from Fox and Limbaugh and scores of others. Do we really need to lower the bar to that level?	4
1	Conservative voters aren't informed people. That's why they love the idea of drug testing for social welfare programs.	4
0	The problem is Eisenhower may as well have been a wartime president during WWII because he served the military in such a critical position and then served as president soon after. It makes sense business would have more connections to the government during that time period. This is an entirely different mindset than today. The Iraq war was poorly laid out (b/c it was a bad idea, Sadame was a tyrant however democracy wasn't viable yet in that region) therefore companies treated it as a way to make money rather than putting in to protect democracy and the free market.	4

0	This interview was heavy on WMD but the premise was the 911 connection. In hindsight we can see everything that was wrong prior to the invasion and for everything that has gone wrong since. Bad, bad, bad. But it could have been far worse than all of that put together. If Saddam Hussein had not believed we were bluffing there was nothing stopping him from calling North Korea and turning the administration's lies into a reality.	4
0	Your arguments don't counter the FACT that the public overwhelmingly supported the bill in the Senate.  Until you admit that, you are lost.	4
0	It was an example of a fallacious argument used by some people on the left. Maybe it was an unfair representation, but the real arguments aren't far from that.  "In the UK/Australia/wherever they have more strict gun laws, now gun crime is X there and it's still Y in the United States, when will we come to our senses and stop this violence?"  That's like, the most prevalent argument employed in public discussion on gun control. My point is that it totally ignores all kinds of other societal and public policy differences between the US and other nations that surely impact the crime rates.	4

1	Time to be my /r/progressive buzzkill self, I guess.  Slightly uncomfortable with lumping obviously indefensible tweets with 'Conservatives', seems like the sort of broad paint brushing that'd infuriate me if it were reversed.  Also don't quite understand why digging for and echoing/highlighting the racist tweets of no-name crackpots is effort well spent.    I get that while I'm against this sort of sports-team-style-boostering as politics, it is exactly the sort of tribalism and cheerleading that people would visit /r/progressive to be apart of, and I could easily press that 'unsubscribe' button over there.	4
1	You've got to admit that the bar is set pretty low there.	4
0	I'm not a conservative. As you suggest, they support the authority of those currently in power, but my point is that conservatives do this in every country. I've always had a pretty strong disrespect for authority figures, so I generally find myself in opposition to conservatives. Nonetheless, not being a progressive, I can at least understand both perspectives.	4
0	Who says that? Any "conspiracy theorist" worth his salt realizes the Democrat/Republican scam. They are two sides of the same coin.  Hilary is just another neocon establishment politician.  In before the downvotes: I am not a Republican... or a Democrat.	4
1	It's the "the poor today are still better off than the richest kings in the past." It's a bullshit comparison that cherry picks/distorts history and current situations for many people.	4

1	Is Bernie Sanders the Best Candidate for ANY CHANGE?.... YES!	4

0	That's exactly what is was.  Another partisan bumpersticker, just like the one above it.  And it doesn't do anything to fix any problem, just like the one above it. I'm sorry if my sarcasm was lost.  I'm not a conservative, I'm not a liberal. My views and opinions are diverse.  I'm just getting tired of the extreme partisanship on both sides.  The hate, the condescension, the authoritarianism, both sides.  Time to find some common ground and introduce some basic respect back into our political system.  Stay well.	4
0	This is one of very few points where I disagree with Sanders. I don't think the problem is the *Citizens United* decision because that is ultimately a free speech issue--and I'm very hesitant to take rights away once they've been granted. What needs to happen is that the concept of corporate personhood needs to be reevaluated and we need strict guidelines over what personhood rights a corporation can have. As much as I like people getting an equal voice in government, I'm not sold on completely taking money out of politics.	4
0	Compared to the number that won't and women that would be mobilized to vote for Clinton, a drop in the bucket.  Socialist label is death. And this time they just quote him saying he is one.  There is a reason Republicans don't want to go against Clinton. There is a reason they want to go against Sanders. They are capable of doing polls too and you can bet they have done them.  All I want is the Republicans to lose.  Therefore I want the candidate that can beat them.  Anything else is disaster worse than the 8 years of Bush.	4
1	I think you may have misunderstood me...... allow me to restate;  Why is the Press not asking Jeb W Bush about his brother's creating ISIS by sending americans to die in a fake war?	4

1	Politifact: Our ruling  Huckabee said he "raised average family income by 50 percent" during his tenure as Arkansas governor.  Once you account for inflation, Huckabee is incorrect. Income in Arkansas increased 20 percent, not 50 percent. That increase trailed nationwide trends.   The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.	4

0	Sure, for example if someone reads Ayn Rand I do presume they are of a libertarian/conservative/GOP-kind but I also acknowledge that some people, like J. K. Rowling, while certifiably political do not have the same effect.   Yes elitist control over society is deep but I'm not sure it's fair to say it's entirely contrary to the foundation of your country or anyones country as the great thinkers are mostly read by the rich and powerful and not the farmer without lessening the work farmers and the common man do in the foundation of a country.	4

1	Oh, they have. They just ship them overseas to the Indians and Chinese that aren't so greedy to ask for things like "liveable wages" or "good working conditions".	4
1	It's worth noting here that military service provides social services like support for college that should be available to all. I think we should start thinking about the possible benefits of a national service for high school graduates to join for a couple of years — a community-oriented institution through which people could "be deployed" around the country to serve people and build stronger social relations, which could also be a program used to fund college tuition, etc.	4

0	What problem do you have with my explanation?  It is not highly technical nor particularly long-winded.  In fact, as the article itself explains, he could have used a much larger number than one out of four and still been technically correct.  Even narrowing the discussion to large enterprises, his claim remained 100% technically correct.  Only some other claim that the Senator himself never argued is half-true.  The fact that you continue to have trouble with this very simple matter is a plausible reason to doubt you are able to think clearly.	4

Senator Sanders made no such claim, and the claim he did make was 100% factually correct.  Rating the claim as "half true" tells us more about Politifact's slippery grasp of the truth than anything else.	4

1	I agree.  For all these stories that the GOP is dying or is dead that I've seen over the years, they still control the agenda in Washington and show no sign of relinquishing that power.  Part of it has to do with the fact that its not just old people that vote Republican, but there seems to be an ever more fanatical young group of Republicans being groomed to take their place.  Also many people still hate the Democrats enough where they would not vote for them no matter what.	4

1	While this is true, it doesn't necessarily mean much.  You would need at least similar conditions, specifically an energized youth vote favoring democrats.  And the demographic is notoriously difficult to get to the polls.  I am not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying that this means it is that much MORE important to energize the young voters.	4

Is Warren being racist for criticizing the president as we've heard for 6+ years, or is Obama being oppressive for calling out women (native American woman?  That's a double hit against him).  Very interesting case study in oppression and how the left divides people into little buckets	4

0	As a male, I can assure you that no male can really *see* the female perspective. However, we can definitely try to understand it and *attempt* to see in the female perspective. For me, engaging in a discussion is the best way to see a different viewpoint and understand it better. However, these things can be different for various people, and some people might not be willing to discuss respectfully, and that can end in an argument. Whatever happens, be sure to always make whomever you're speaking to know that you're willing to answer the questions they have that are respectful. Good luck!	5

1	It's not like these women who seek late-term abortions are just plain procrastinating and then decide "oh crap, I changed my mind" or anything. These are wanted babies who would die slowly and painfully and only know pain. Aborting them is sad, but humane. It provides a quick, painless death.  It's not like such a procedure is mandatory. It's really up to the mother. And it's not like it's an easy decision either.	5
0	I would consider you a feminist, all feminism is, is the radical notion that women are people, and that women and people in general deserve equal rights. Feminism is not a bad word, you do not have to be a certain gender to be a feminist, that would defeat the purpose of equality. Everything you said about supporting womens rights and such is what feminism is about.	5
1	This actually makes me want to see the movie even more. Hopefully it won't just have a strong female presence in relation to action flicks, but movies in general.  I still love the originals and have fond memories watching them as a boy with my dad, but I'll be honest that the franchise was tainted in my eyes considering the lead actor.   A new film in an awesome series in one of my favorite genres (post-apocalyptic action), with a new less racist and sexist lead, *and* a positive female presence with an awesome actress? It's a good time to enjoy the movies I do.	5

My current username is somewhat neutral - a few years back, when I used a more ~feminine sounding name on reddit, I got greeted by insults within minutes...

On another note, I hate youtube's recommendation system o.O For every feminist video you watch, it lists 10 anti-feminist videos... stupid MRA spam.	5

0	If your feminism isn't intersectional, it's not really feminism.. And he's shown time and time again that his "feminism" applies only to white women. And even that "feminism" and his "strong female leads" are constantly dependent on men. Black Widow is just the latest in a long line of other fictional women that he's done this to.	5
0	Not that anyone on this sub or in real life should care.  But lots of cishet men don't like high heels either.	5

0	Agreed. I just kind of thought this was obvious because we'd need equality in social influence in order to have the kinds of sexual dimorphism we do today. I think the better statement would be "before there was sexual dimorphism, there was social equality," which is more impactful to me.	5
0	Do you know what a joke is? The 'male tears' stuff is making fun of men who already have preconceptions that feminism is misandry. People don't actually want to drink your tears.	5

0	I think in most of the examples given the men were mostly mad that a fundamental aspect of the movie has changed, "Nobody barks orders to Mad Max."  Men went to watch the movie to see Mad Max fuck shit up just like he did in the original, only to see the movie taken over by a Woman lead and hate the reasons that happened. The same reason men are mad that the 'Ghostbusters' reboot will have an all-female cast.   I'd like to see an example of MRA's criticizing an original / non-sequel movie for this reason. I can't think of an example off the top of my head.	5
1	&gt;MRA's are upset that men are not represented in this film  That's just the thing. Why, in your capacity as someone fighting for rights, are you upset about not being being the main focus in *just this one particular film*? That clearly is qualitatively different from a broad lack of representation, which is the actual concern here.  &gt; the same as women who were upset they were not represented in film.  That's exactly why the two situations are not at all the same.	5
0	&gt; People who are dressed like 'whatever' shouldn't have something so negative happen to them just because of what they are wearing.  100% agree with you. It's a disgrace that so much judgment comes from how people look.  I'm going to plug my subreddit here, because this is exactly what I started it to discuss - if you're interested, take a look at /r/AppearanceRevolution.	5
1	I just saw the film today and I must say... I loved it. There were, of course, one or two things I wish were done differently. However, the women in the film held their own and both genders cooperated rather than one submitting and the other saving. I felt it was a refreshing surprise in the world of action movies. If more were like this, I would support them in the box office (as I have done with this one).	5
1	My brother just recently advised me not to to call myself Feminist because people will think I mean I hate men. Also he asked why I'd want to associate myself with 'that lot'.   It sucks because he believes in the definition of Feminism but he thinks the word has been smeared too much and "no one thinks of it that way". It means something else in his mind and no arguing could set him straight.  If other people feel like he does then those who have worked tirelessly to destroy the feminist movement have won in many ways...	5
1	I just.  WOW.    If I were one of those women, I feel like I'd be thinking, "I'm sitting RIGHT HERE and I can hear you."	5

1	I'm curious - have your forays into Black liberation/nationalist/etc. theory taken you to texts like Assata Shakur's "An Autobiography," Audre Lorde's "Sister Outsider," or Alice Walker's "In Search of Our Mother's Garden"?  So far, the way you're framing your question makes it seem like you're discussing feminist theory and literature as external to Blackness, while the two struggles inform each other in significant ways.	5
0	Yeah but that doesn't mean that Age of Ultron is faultless.	5
0	I don't mean to be a wet arse but this isn't something a scientist would research. That is the feild of archeology, not science. Also, that article just slaps the word scientist onto it in an attempt to be more convinving. There are many types of scientists, take for example my father, a scientist who studies soil. I'm not saying that I disagree with the article (I don't) I'm just saying that this article was poorly made. Please, don't kill my inbox.	5
0	I don't see why the burden of proof is on me.  All I have to offer is my anecdotal evidence.  You've been just as forceful in reiterating that you don't believe me.    You're welcome to believe that only a vocal few are the cause of all the violent, misogynist rancor on reddit and in society.  But the fact of the matter is that sexism is a spectrum, not a dichotomous choice.  If you don't see the majority of people as sexist, then you don't have as nuanced an understanding of what sexism means.	5
0	Well traditionally many entered because it was better than dying in childbirth because abortions were illegal. I wonder how many of these new nuns are Irish?	5
0	Bingo. I'm married so I haven't interacted with single guys doing single guy things for a while but I have noticed the vehement rage guys seem to have when I suggest that it's them specifically that's the problem, not 50% of the world. Not to generalize, but most men don't have the strength or mental fortitude to deal with the reality that they're just not good enough for most women.	5
1	Something I find interesting is that this same blogger is probably one of those people that - if we were to confront him with the sexism or militarism or racism in something like *Transformers* - would answer dismissively with "it's just a movie, don't take it so seriously".	5
0	My mother always said, there are three sides to every argument.	5

0	&gt;Well the feminists who represent feminism don't think so. They bash gender roles only to turn around an unconsciously impose gender roles.  Are you going to write anything constructive or are you just trying to write your narrow impressions of feminism to as many places as possible before you get banned?	5
1	The article is talking about equality in social influence, not morphology or division of labor. I don't think you'll find anyone claiming that dimorphism in humans doesn't exist.	5
1	Honestly dude, it's a *movie*. It was made by the same guy who did the first ones. Why don't MRAs spend their time *actually working on issues that matter and disadvantage men* like campaigning to get male rape/sex assault victim resources and shelters, off the top of my head. Honestly, if the MRA movement actually focused on male issue that really need to be addressed, I wouldn't think of the movement as a joke, but I never see any actual topics discussed.	5

1	"a piece of American culture"  Umm... Buddy. Mate. It's a very Australian series.   Also. What a load of bullshit.	5
1	Similar to how a boy raped by a woman has to pay her child support for 18 years.	5
1	New life goal: become an uber-feminist	5
1	I had the exact same thought.   I also noticed several (not saying all) claims that feminists don't have a sense of humor, and then demonstrate similar hypocrisy where they complain about jokes at men's expense.	5
0	I think so, yes.	5
1	Interesting result, but as the article itself states:   &gt; “We'd have to see this as a pattern across multiple polls,” she said. “We never want to draw too many conclusions from just a single poll.”	5
0	As interesting as your hypothetical examples are, I'm not sure how they apply to this situation? Bahar Mustafa is a woman of colour in a country where white men hold the majority of power. Her statement is therefore correct.	5
0	It is irrelevant.  This was an instance of gendered violence, true, but to use it as evidence of a larger culture of violence that targets men trivializes the crime.  I have yet to understand why you think this is relevant to feminism.	5
1	We're so popular! Even our haters come to play!	5
1	It doesn't say anything about women in general, it says moms. I think it's safe to assume most moms care for babies and clean their homes, at least to some extent.	5
1	This quote is telling: &gt; "But why do they use that megaphone to tell someone they look fat when they have a photo posted online?" she asked.  &gt;"It is deplorable," Ohanian said. "The vast majority of the time, the people using these platforms are good."  One of Reddit's big problems when dealing with problematic issues is the seeming site-wide insistence on talking about the quality of the people involved, not talking about the quality of what they did and said.	5
0	Not to change the subject but as an atheist we have this same problem. Try to keep that in mind when you consider bashing /r/atheism	5
0	That doesn't change the fact that some people simply cannot consist on a veg-only diet. Even the Dalai Lama, after being a veg for all his life, now eats meat because his doctors said he needs to to be healthy. It's simply unrealistic. I was veg for a long time, but then my anemia got worse as I got older and dietitians said I NEED meat in my diet or I'll be fainting more frequently and cause my body harm in the long run. In a perfect world, nothing dies. But this isn't a perfect world and it never will be.	5
1	I was following and in agreement up until the bit about it not representing the LGBQT community.   It wasn't a romance movie and aside from Joe's obsession with the "Breeders" sexual interest in the movie was for the most part nonexistant. We don't know the sexual orientation of any of the main characters, mainly because having a strong love story in this movie would've ruined it, so it's up for speculation what orientation everyone has. (Except for maybe Max who has an actual back story from the previous films)	5
0	I would prefer only men, but that's just my opinion	5
0	just the headline makes me want to puke..	5
1	From what I've read, he's just a massive troll/asshole. Again, that's founded in personal bias and I don't 100% know him, but he doesn't seem like a nice guy regardless of how his opinions may shift to annoy the most people.	5
1	So we must wring our hands over every inequality or we are not doing our job as feminists? Sure there are female garbage collectors in my wee town and I'm glad they aren't sexist in their selection of employees. Satisfied? Picking out isolated examples of where women have gained power then throwing that in feminists' faces as though it's some sort of counterpoint to the overall imbalance of gender distribution amongst world leaders and CEOs....oohkay then.	5
0	I'm sorry, I should have been more specific. I should have said that he is essentially incapable of writing his own bills *and getting them passed.* Writing hundreds of bills that die in committee is not an accomplishment.	5
0	Maybe. Or sexist people could just be a vocal minority.	5
0	It's because a large chunk of reddit are the neckbeard mindset. They're on Reddit because they are nerdy, shy, and women haven't paid attention to them so they lash out because they suck.	5

0	hey honest question why should a small business have to pay for anyones choice to have a child? I mean sick leave I totally get cause it  was not a decision, but getting pregnant is a choice why should a private entity have to pay for your choice?	5
1	Add me to the list of guys even more hyped to see this movie now :)	5
1	Great points! If there is anything else Mad Max did prove, it's that having strong female characters in an action movie is not going to have a negative impact on ticket sales. Hopefully this opens the doors for better representation in future action films.	5
0	No it doesn't. Take your marriage certificate to the Ali Forney Center and it's not gonna find a kid a stable home or change their parents minds. It only helps you. So don't canonize yourself just yet. Winning marriage equality in a state doesn't stop bullying, it doesn't prevent discriminatory firing, it doesn't create housing. Suggesting it does is a guilt-comforting lie.	6
1	Gay Marines, rah!	6
1	You're in the wrong subreddit.	6
0	Can you see that there are 2 parts to bisexuality? One is homosexual and one is heterosexual? And that the heterosexual relationship is permitted?	6
1	Because if libertarians ran the world, we'd still be throwing rocks at each other, and dying at the ripe old age of 30. The clueless selfishness of libertarians will forever baffle me.	6
0	Well that's a ridiculous position to hold.	6
1	He hasn't explicitly said what name he was choosing for himself and as of last week he was asking people to continue using male pronouns. Although many news outlets have began using female pronouns after the interview, so all in all we don't know what Jenner prefers.	6
1	It has nothing to do with being an openly Christian company. It's about supporting anti-gay movements that proliferate bigotry and other harmful ideologies. That isn't exclusively a Christian thing (granted they are pretty good at it).	6
0	If it were you would you dump him?	6
0	Oh, I very much dislike the 3rd one, the cross between male and female.  A trans friend said that she is a she and wants to be portrayed as a she. This mixed one just goes to single her out more.   Oi, I'm being downvoted?  So much for tolerance, right?	6
1	A bisexual person calling themselves gay and somebody else calling them gay is very different though. If i call myself gay, i know what i mean, and i know i'm not gay. if somebody else calls me gay (unless they're a friend/we have an understanding), it seems like they're disrespecting and ignoring my identity.	6
1	Gorgeous!!!! All the best and congratulations!!!	6
0	Or it says you want to hate and destroy the thing you don't agree with... instead of trying to understand and accept it. If any homosexual (I am one) wants to kill any other group of people because of their beliefs or practices, I think that's extremely hypocritical. Because if gays ruled the world, that's the mentality that would see straight people persecuted. This cartoon is just not funny and I don't support it. It's no funnier than any cartoon showing wife beating, or child abuse, is it? And if it is, why is it?	6
0	Literally rolled up to their office and had a meeting	6
1	Please do bear in mind that bisexuality is a legitimate sexual orientation for many people. It's not just a transitory state on the way to being gay.	6
1	Well, he came out of denying it / actively avoiding it. He really is quite stereotypically gay in many ways. However, that's not always accurate.	6
1	I understand this. These are the words my daughter chose to use in coming out. I didn't feel it necessary to argue semantics and orientations with her right now with other things at hand. Thank you for pointing it out. We will focus on it later.	6
1	Psych major. I'm crying. Terrible twisting of all the hard work in my field.	6

1	I just don't know what I'm going to tell my children if they see two straight people kissing...	6

1	&gt; Does no one realize the historical parallels?   A not insignificant number of them still think that they were, in fact, on the right side of history previously, and that the wrong side were the ones that won. And so they're still fighting hoping their "right" side can eventually win.	6
1	I'd never think I'd ever hear myself say this, but Miley Cyrus is kinda awesome.	6

1	Anyone else feel like he is capitalizing (money-wise) on his coming out? It seems like he only wanted to officially come out when he could make something from it...	6
0	Yeah you're right about that. And even if she was alone, the security guard was obviously on her side. I'd probably lose that fight but i'd definitely stand up for myself.	6
1	Not really unexpected, in my opinion. We know that she did something special for a homeless at an award show sometime last year. She also spoke out against the Indiana's RFRA bill (even though a lot of people criticized her for jumping on a bandwagon). Really the image we see of her is just an image, it gets us talking.	6
1	My 17 yo is queer, too.  My best,immediate advice to you is to Like her post! Show her that you are PUBLICLY accepting her and standing with her.  As plankidonk said...  this is your child. You've known this about her for a while and are accepting of it. Now is the time for you to be the best parent you can be. Like her post! Go, do it now! And good luck!	6
0	Leviticus does not mention homosexuality explicitly. Nowhere in the bible is it mentioned. I refer to the originating texts as the source. If the term "homosexuality" is in there, it's a blatant and egregious error in translation.	6
0	Normally I would agree with you, but his poor grammar actually causes him to express opposite views from the ones he clearly has.   Saying he wants to be apart of the movement is a very very different thing than saying that he wants to be a part of it.	6

1	IKR?  I have no problem with "straight" people as long as they act gay in public!  I mean I get that they choose to live that lifestyle or whatever, but why do I have to see it?	6
1	clickbait title, imo.  I'm not gonna say she isn't genderqueer, but all Miley herself really did say was she doesn't really identify with what society typically defines girl or boy, in terms of expectations of pressures.	6
0	I can see both sides to the argument here, but unless the majority of ALL students, not just the LGBT ones, vote against it, it won't and should not be stopped. If you feel that strongly about them, simply don't give them any of your money. Now if the majority of students vote against them being there, then they shouldn't be allowed on campus. It should be left up to the students, not random people on the internet.	6
1	As an asexual on the side of the spectrum that is repulsed by sex, I'd relate it to someone wanting for the two of us to be submerged in a vat of fat, smelly slugs and eat them and let them slither down our throats and be little fat sacks of pus. And that's the "natural, normal, and healthy" thing to want to do.	6
0	But it seems that bi women smoke a lot more by percentage.	6
1	Great quote in the comments though   "Males do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual. The world is not to be divided into sheep and goats. Not all things are black nor all things white. It is a fundamental of taxonomy that nature rarely deals with discrete categories. Only the human mind invents categories and tries to force facts into separated pigeon-holes. The living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects. The sooner we learn this concerning human sexual behavior, the sooner we shall reach a sound understanding of the realities of sex." --Alfred Kinsey, 'Sexual Behavior in the Human Male' (1948)	6

0	I think exposing hypocrisy in politics and/or religion is a goddamned public service.  This guy outed himself by using Grindr. It's the internet. You should assume anything you put out there is at least semi-public, especially if you include real photos of yourself and ESPECIALLY if you have a social media presence built around your real name/identity.	6
0	Don't hate on religion, direct your displeasure towards extremist haters.	6
1	"Gay can mean a lot of things. What do you mean?" "I am a homosexual. *I like men.*"	6

0	Well, there was also the fact that this idiot doesn't much seem to care about getting their views from sources more reputable than Tumblr Inaction.  (Deliberately misspelled.)	6
0	Hmm... I am having a difficult time believing your story that everyone is accepting of you and your wife as a pre-op, especially in the military. Moreover, I find it very hard to believe that people are defying a direct order in regards to registered gender.   Lastly, cases of having an incorrect sex marked wouldn't just case issues with insurance, this would also be a security risk and issue.	6
0	So how is bisexuality different than a combination of both heterosexuality and homosexuality.	6
1	&gt;So what's the next step? Why not a gay superhero with a deep and sincere love interest? They got so close with that last Spiderman movie.  I'd say Jude in The Fosters is an important landmark that needs further praise. A gay pre-teen (or is he 13 now?) growing up and dealing with bullying and getting support from his family, coupled with Connor/homophobia storyline.	6

1	I didn't expect it to have the support that it does actually, but thank you.  The way I see it is this. She's trying to make an excuse for her obesity at the expense of the LGBT community. She knows we're a community with increasing acceptance in society, and increasing political presence and is trying to use that to bolster her own agenda, which quite frankly I see as invalid. Again. I understand being happy in your own skin, but this isn't that. It's simply deluding yourself into thinking obesity is pique physical shape, or even less extreme, but still laughable; acceptable physical shape.	6
0	Nice attempt, but still plenty of generalizations and misinformation.  This is a much more accurate explanation (though of course longer):  http://www.tranarchism.com/2010/11/26/not-your-moms-trans-101/	6

1	Driving into a building trying to kill people does though.. She tried to injury people.. with a vehicle..   Also your quotations around what I said really doesn't make to much relevant sense.

1	As much as I think equality shouldn't be a matter of popular opinion, I am excited for this.   Returning a Yes vote not only allows me to get married in my home town (yay!) but also sends a clear signal to the homophobes in Ireland : "Shush now, we're tired of hearing your shite".	6

0	There is a massive, massive statistical difference between people who use condoms and people who do not. That is a discriminating characteristic that makes at least some degree of sense. To group people who do use condoms and who do not use condoms together is to undermine scientific integrity for the sake of being able to use the statistical grouping "men who have sex with men". I say this is bigotry.  It demands either my celibacy or it results in the denial of my right to contribute to the strength of a medical system that supports me.	6

The problem is that only a very small handful of researchers are doing this research.	6
0	I addressed this in the final paragraph. I'm not saying corporations are pure good entities filled with integrity. What I'm saying is that we need them on our side to get progress done in America. A large part of LGBT progress has been made due to well known celebrities and their companies supporting them.	6
0	Yes. Queer just means you don't fit quite into any other definition. Bisexual means you like men and women specifically.	6
1	Friggin straight people, just have to let everyone know they're straight all the damn time. We GET it! Jeez! There are straight characters all over my TV now, so shut up!	6

1	He has no social skills I'll give him that. But when we try to talk to him about it, he makes excuses and talks over us. So there's not much we can do in that regard.   When you're willfully ignorant and defiant, you'll never change for the better.	6
1	Oh, those wacky liberals...always teaching their kids to tolerate other people and stuff.	6
0	Sounds like SRS and ainbow are leaking.  Yuck	6
0	I'm very fond of them! :) Great church to grow up queer in too. [**This is my bishop**](http://www.dioceseofnewark.org/sites/default/files/images/IMGP8526-web.jpg). He's straight (afaik) but he's on our diocese's float in the Pride parade every year.	6
0	To whomever downvoted me - it's nice that you are either pro-LGBT or antigun.  You have that right.  But you have to look at the whole picture.  Increased funding for schools (taxes).  Increased welfare (taxes).  Against immigration reform.  The only thing the guy has going for him is that he's pro-LGBT and pro-choice.  Why can't we have a candidate who'll just live and let live, so to speak?  You know, a Libertarian.	6
1	Are you honestly saying that immigration reform and increased funding for schools is a BAD thing?	6
1	Good job shutting down the hate cycle! :)	6
1	First the Kardashians, now Miley Cyrus.  I'm beginning to think people are good or something.	6
0	If you dig deep enough you'll find LGBT and anti-LGBT organisations are bankrolled by the same people... it's like Left/Right politics, you're better off convincing people by showing them how being open minded and tolerating other perspectives can be really useful.	6
1	It think it was obvious that the poster wasn't asking for those things at the exclusion of actual qualification. Having a president like that would give a a lot of good representation for people of color, women and transgender people.	6

1	My Dad was a loving, wonderful man who knew I was transgendered and gay all my life. Hugs abounded, and yet I grew up the twisted, evil stereotyp-  No, just kidding. I grew up happy and well-adjusted. :-)	6
0	Can I get a source on that? I'm not disagreeing with you, I was just always under the thought that because a person owns a business they have a right to do whatever they please under that business.	6
0	Fuck Iceland and their homophobic schemes. I am going to colonize Scandinavia with my army of grindr followers, bears and the use of sodomy and half bisexuals.	6
0	Please read the above for some of my reasons...and once again we are all already equal to a DEGREE and that's been around for years but i do agree mens behavior contributes to the feminism argument but there is more than that at stake as like i said everyone is discriminated against in many ways. It isn't just women who draw some of the short straws.  And remember I believe that all genders should be/are Equal. By the way thanks for the Question Feyle :)	6
1	They aren't reporting the nature of the complaint. The students either missed the point of the lesson completely, or were pissed that something gay positive was being presented. Sadly, either one is equally possible.	6
1	I was almost hoping it was this one! It is absolutely over the top with stranger danger and pedophilia = homosexuality propaganda. Many of the old educational films from this era are outrageously outdated and inaccurate, if not patently offensive (Boys Beware is obviously a good example of the latter).  However, as long as the film was introduced and discussed properly, I think it would be a very good way to show how society and how society treats homosexuality has evolved since 1959.	6
0	That is certainly debatable and is being debated, that is why I don't think it should be included as proven fact.   I'm not even going to talk to the teacher. I'm helping her, not doing it for her.	6
1	I know a lot of people these days say to "block" or "defriend" people with opposing views. But I think our movement advanced so well and so quickly because it's difficult to discriminate when you know someone who's part of the group you're supposed to hate. Just my two cents. We win by showing how well we can live.	6
0	Way to go Sarah. It won't be long until it is irrelevant in your State. I love Texas but right now you are disappointing me. You of all people should appreciate the freedom to do and be who you are. You say you are proud Americans but I'm gathering that is if you are not gay. Your hate and your misunderstanding of the constitution is shameful and hopefully in a few weeks you will be humbled by SCOTUS. You say you want freedom of religion I saw I want freedom from religion. Stop using your ministers, bishops, and rabbis to enact hatred.	6
1	I've witnessed young kids reacting in this exact way when they first learn about gay people. Why is this so unbelievable?	6
0	&gt;Because people are hypocrites who have double standards   exaclty. It is sad to see such behavior within the own lgbt community	6
1	Perhaps because it is also cynical and useless?	6
0	Huh. I read this and thought this--  "Attacking an ally with a bullshit argument based on no actual facts. It's pretty straight forward. This is totally bi-erasure."	6
0	Aren't we all just a bunch of special snowflakes.	6
0	The past two terms of Obama were supposed to teach us that it isn't about what the president wants; (s)he needs a Congress who agrees, and wants to actually work with them.	6

0	Is the writer so closed-minded that the bull couldn't have been gay before and straight now? And why are we worried so much about labeling the bull? Can't all the cows just BE instead of all of them be labeled as something?	6
1	There is still a radical edge, but those people are considered spooky scary skeletons.	6
1	I think a lot of them do want us dead. OK, not, like, shoot-them-in-the-streets dead (though I'm sure there are some folks out there who endorse that sentiment), more of a maybe-if-we-ignore-them-they'll-just-go-away dead.   I don't mean to minimize the way things are now. But at least in terms of marriage, the right-wing hate machine is really on the defensive. It's really not the 1990s anymore.   But you're right to point out there's still lots of work to do.	6
0	It's a start...	6
0	really? I didnt know that until now. I guess its like those Leprechaun horror movies from a few decades ago.	6
1	I will be the first person to jump on someone for putting down fat people.   But you're right. There is no sensible comparison here.	6
1	Their argument against gay marriage has nothing to do with marriage. What a poorly thought out campaign that turned out to be.	6
0	The problem is that protection under the law should not be accessible just through a single avenue that the state has decided upon. Marriage equality is still privileging a certain kind of behavior which the state has decided is appropriate.  Edit: Not really sure why I'm being down voted for pointing out that mainstream queer folks are perfectly happy to get the cookie straights are handing out for acting like good queers and not being radical. Y'all are cowards.	6

1	This government is literally eroding British culture, and it hasn't even been a week. This nation has a cultural and artistic heritage of equality, decency to the vulnerable and a protection of liberty. The fact that the gay marriage bill got through with little to no controversy should show that. And now, not even a week into the election, the tories are dismantling everything this nation stands for. Human rights? Gone. Surveillance? Increased. Homophobia? State-sanctioned. Cruelty to animals? Back on the table.	6
0	For what he actually did at first with Ted Cruz it was way overblown and people started hating on him for no real reason.   What if someone is anti-gay all gay people are supposed to avoid them now? How else will they learn that gay people are just as normal and boring as everyone else? He didn't donate any money to his campaign and just asked him questions about his views on homosexuality and why they were that and that did he still have those after eating at a gay household, etc.	6
0	This is kinda funny actually because there are many women against feminism and telling women what feminism is e.g. http://womenagainstfeminism.tumblr.com/  Like ive said feminism (in its old context/description) is just about equality if you want it bluntly but guess what modern feminism is laughable when they become hypocrites and find ways to down men when many of the issues still presented have been solved such as the wage gap (god this myth is the one that is used the most) read all the above posts for other reasons.  Get this clear though i dont hate women. I just dont get behind modern feminism within communities and social media.	6
1	I'll change names, but I had some kid ask me in front of their parent (who is a friend) if i was dating anyone.  Without missing a beat, i quipped "Yea, HIS name is 'Matt'."    Took the kid a second, then I got a "but that's a boy's name", and my retort of "i know".  That was soon followed by the mom realizing I just came out to her and the kid.  High fives all around.  Good times.	6
1	I bet he's using the "social experiment" excuse to cover his hatred.	6
0	Different folks, I guess	6
0	This is creative writing. Do not take it too seriously...	6
1	Awesome article, but I think you may have skewed the data for the title. "In the poll, conducted by Hart Research Associates and Public Opinion Strategies for the news organizations in late April, 61 percent of respondents said they’d be either enthusiastic about or comfortable with a gay presidential candidate. For an evangelical candidate, just 52 percent said they'd be enthusiastic." It sounds like they didn't mention how many people would be "comfortable" with an evangelical president, suggesting that the overall support for an evangelical president would be around equal if not greater than a gay president.	6
1	No this was straight up homophobia and the developers should be crucified for it.	6

0	&gt; dysphoric   you're not explaining. I'm asking a question here, hence the question mark in the title. I just posted my opinion to explain why I think the way I do	6
1	Thanks, I hope not either. I explained to him black mail is a crime and that I have his texts saved. I think it worked haha.	6
0	Isn't gay marriage going to be legal in June? I can't see the SCOTUS saying no, and the president can't override the decision of the SCOTUS as far as I know.  ~~Still I can't find anything that says whether he's Republican or Democrat. This is crucial because I cannot vote for Republicans after they betrayed the American people.~~  EDIT: Ok, so he's independent, got it.	6
0	Don't forget the thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants voting in Florida, who are also a lock for democrats, and the thousands of dead people voting in counties completely controlled by the democrats.    I'm a liberal democrat, and I am not going to vote for a single republican in the coming election, but that doesn't mean I have to pretend that all these false accusations are true.	6
1	I don't know about you, but I practice kegels so much just flexing my ass now can cause pinches in the space time continuum.	6
1	&gt; Educating other people's children is not your responsibility  Whilst that's true a 15 year old is hardly a "child". Certainly legally they are, but that's an individual who's almost an adult and can certainly handle an adult discussion about respecting other people.  From the sounds of it the kid took it on board politely as well.  Lecturing someone's kid is one thing, but I think this is jsut being respectful neighbours.	6
1	Oh it will never be over. At least not in our lifetime. We will be hearing about marriage equality for a long long time. In the US the Supreme Court put it's foot down about abortion in the 70's and we are still hearing about it.	6
1	So just generally intolerant.	6
0	Alright, I editted the question to align more with your wording! Thanks	6
1	&gt;Our reaction wasn't even a blip on this kid's radar when she came out.   This is the biggest compliment she could give you and the greatest validation your parenting on this could get :)	6
1	For some people it is a transitory state, they grew up with the expectation of liking the opposite sex, but find they like the same sex too so assume they're bi only to realize later that they were never attracted to the opposite sex, they just expected themselves to be.  I've seen it go the other way too, people assume they're gay when they notice they're attracted to the same sex only later to realize that their attraction to the opposite sex was legitimate and not conditioned so for them coming out as gay was a transitory state to coming out as bi.	6
1	Certainly it cant be worse then Russia...	6
0	Nah, he is saying that gay people should be allowed to have sex, and that a civil union for gay people is a good thing (he gives Germany as an example), but gay people shouldn't be allowed to adopt.   He's pretty conservative	6
1	How the fuck does someone get so mad that they are like -- "We should pay for a giant billboard just to make sure that those people, you know, the ones being happy and minding their own business over there... just to make sure that they know we definitely think they are horrible people"?!	6

1	I'm not attracted to solely personalities, I'm also attracted to bodies. Which often have genders. So. No.	6
0	I hope so. Hard to tell in a comment,so maybe it was wrong to assume they did mean they would consider racially, sexual, or gender diversity over professional qualifications. I hope if a candidate like that ever does appear, that they will be voted in because of their qualifications and they will end up doing well..because if not, it will have the very opposite effect for the representation for people of diversity.	6
0	Close enough for Mitnick, whatever that means.	6
1	I don't know his school or area, but is there a  GSA (gay-straight alliance) at his school?  There are probably more straight allies than gay kids, but he could maybe meet gay kids there.   Also, does his school have an LGBTQ support group?  Mine does and it helped me come out as Bisexual and meet other LGBT kids.	6

1	Even if this is really a "social experiment" they said they were testing how people respond to a low quality game on greenlight. There is no reason for this game to target lgbt+ people. They could've released 'Kill the Teddy Bear' and have you shoot teddy bears instead. The game would still be low quality and lgbt+'people wouldn't be so unnecessarily targeted.	6
1	It'll be interesting to see what happens in this new Conservative majority government.  For all the hate the Liberal Democrats got for the coalition, they kept the Conservatives closer to the middle ground and allowed for some progress to LGBT issues.  This time however being a majority they don't need to do.	6
0	Sorry, some parents never change their opinion, given any amount of time. This is just a fact. They have hate trained into them from an early age and can't let go of it.	6
0	We need to talk abou LGBT rights in places outside the US too. More than once I've talked about an issue and been told "but almost half of the states have equal marriahe rights now!!! People obviously accept gay people!"  It's frustrating that gay marriage (while being *one* issue) is seen as the most important, almighty deciding factor in LGBT acceptance, and that people totally overlook that there are LGBT people outside of the US, often who face far worse conditions.	6

1	Radical queers have been demonized for much less than that.	6
1	Congratulations! Y'all look super happy.	6
0	This worries me immensely. Conversion therapy is dangerous horse shit, but the government banning any particular treatment is a bad precedent. It's already a problem (ex: certain abortion procedures, gag laws preventing pediatricians from asking about guns in the home). However every time we do this, it's further solidifying the idea that what goes on between a patient and a provider *should* be regulated by the government.  Besides there is a much better way to deal with this through professional organization sanctions, education of providers, and simply continuing the global advancement of LGBT rights in the broader society which makes such treatments look like some shit that only idiots would seek.	6
0	The problems exist in the real world for sure, and it is unfortunate that a genre typically justified by the need for "escape" from the real world through fantasy is generally uninterested in helping oppressed people escape from the burden of thinking about these things all the time/being triggered by scenes of needless and horrific violence. GoT is an especially egregious example.	6

1	I'm a guy and when I go to home depot I have the same experience. I think they're supposed to offer people help as part of their jobs. Kinda like a Wal-Mart greeter (I've never actually seen one of these, convinced it's a myth) has to say hello and attempt small talk. I'm not trying to dismiss your comment, as there is a vast difference between a person just asking if you need help and someone who is just a patronizing asshole.	8
0	* Do not put her in Hospice care . . . as a condition for Hospice they will make you sign over here entire estate to pay for her care.  * You must realize that she is sick, and view everything with that in mind. Regardless of your relationship, you have a filial responsibility to care for her in her final hours.  * Death is a door we must all walk through sooner or later. All you can do is help her face this trial with dignity.	8
1	Hell 18 is still way too young for a 25 year old. Being 18 doesn't mean 'Anything goes' for relationships. Its still weird.	8

But nothing about this screams creepy.  Obviously, we are just seeing his point of view so it's totally possible he's been a total creeper the whole time. I'm just not seeing it from this story.	8

1	for me, it was 40 some odd years of pad with belts then kotex was your ONLY choice and then tampons and then cloth pads and finally the DIVA was so FREEING and worked so incredibly well it was amazing.  there are so few things made just for women that just WORK and work WELL (well, for some of us) and these cups were them.  swimming, running, cycling - they worked so much better than anything else...  so yeah, that is why from my POV	8
0	A satirical fb post on how not to rape I would liken to signs on bathroom stalls about how shoplifting is a crime.  Which they actually fully have.  Just because one person may not do it doesn't mean others won't. It is a big enough problem that something should be said about it. My ex was military and they had classes they had to take on rape. Quite a few of his coworkers came back and were enlightened as to what actually constitutes rape. They weren't bad people but just very misinformed. Not to mention the amount of people who think clothing/drinking etc is an 'open invitation'.	8
0	It's not how boxing should work, which is my point. People who break the law shouldn't be held up as winning public figures, they should be barred from the sports that they play - particularly when it's a boxer who used his skills to beat his wife.	8
1	Nope.  She only weighed about 120lbs at the time and was around 5'9 so it wasn't like she was super strong either	8

1	The reason he "likes" you more/is making advances toward you is that he knows you are young, you are inexperienced, and more easily manipulated than girls his own age, and he is trying to take advantage of you. Don't feel dumb-- you've done the smart thing. Stay safe, and remember that you are wonderful regardless of who wants to get in your pants.	8

1	What do you propose we *do* about it, other than talk about it and make sure everyone knows what a piece of shit he is?  He went through the legal system several times over it.  That's the system we have in place to deal with these sorts of behaviors.  What do you honestly expect the average how citizen to do about it?	8
1	The graphic novel is worth reading before watching the film.	8
0	Ok, then explain how that's relevant since we are specifically talking about a female who tried and failed, but was allowed to join anyways.   See, its not. The point I was making was that to say most women can't even compete is opinion based and gives no value to the conversation whatsoever. Hell, from one fire station to the next, the standards might not even be the same.  There's no data to support the claim.   Reading comprehension dude.	8
0	&gt; And those standards can be reached with dedication  THE ONLY WOMEN WITH THAT KIND OF DEDICATION AND GENETIC POTENTIAL ARE BUSY WINNING GOLD MEDALS AT THE OLYMPICS.  Most men aren't even suitable to be firefighters, women can't even compete.	8

0	This is bullshit. The military strikes a happy medium in my opinion women are allowed to run far slower and do less pushup and strength training in general non combat careers which is fine with me. As a mechanic there were times when a woman may have problems with something heavy but thst was pretty uncommon thanks to mechanical advantage and creativity, and there were absolutely times when I asked a female coworker to reach into a tiny space and get my socket back. For special forces/EOD/combat focused careers there was a much higher bar that was gender neutral because you need to be strong to drag a 200 pound guy with 80 pounds of gear into cover. Win Win	8

Doesn't matter if it's a classical sculpture or 20th-century-style pinups.  Judging by the use of the art for promotion, you did a good job despite the challenge of not being entirely comfortable with the subject.  It shows what you can do in a less than optimal situation.  If the subject is something more comfortable, you'll probably shine even better.  People aren't going to judge an artist by a single piece of work.  You'll be fine.	8
0	&gt; Don't do it. Men that age can get women their own age.  Just because he could get a woman his own age, doesn't mean he *wants* to.  If the OP is his "soulmate", then why would he ignore than a search for someone who is the right age, but wrong in every other way?	8

Women who so desperately need to get what they should be entitled too might cause a few to lie to get the abortion. Just seems like a bad deal.	8
1	Trans women do not experience a cycle. It's also medically inadvisable to listen to a trans person about hormones over a healthy cis person. Trans people's bodies do not process hormones or produce them the same way cis people's do, and a trans person is just not going to have the same experience with hormones as a cis person. Their perspectives are vital for helping other trans people, but you shouldn't use what a trans person says to paint a picture of what it's like to be a cis person, hormonally.	8

0	&gt;At 8 years old someone would not have gone through puberty so of course it's fucking weird to find them attractive  15 year olds have also not gone through puberty (it's about more than T&amp;A, bub). They are still currently going through puberty. They may be finished closer to 18, sometimes 20, 22.	8

0	You've gotta be trolling	8
1	You and your husband should setup some healthy boundries towards her and her future husband. (Her husband and yours are technically innocent bystanders, but it's better if it is more of a set in stone thing.)  For starters: Since your house is also your place of business, they are no longer welcome to come over, but that you would be happy to meet at their house, or for coffee. (That way you can always leave, and then if she does go on the deep end, you have witnesses.)	8

0	So we should reward a person with a job many would literally die for just because she's a female? Any man that failed the test would be considered just another bum. What if people die because she has proved she can't perform the task at hand? Equality is awesome but this is a joke. I don't give a shit how smart someone is if they can't pull me from a fire. Terrible. This subreddit is just completely rediculous sometimes. If you think this is a good thing for women's rights than you are totally fucked up.	8
0	Porn has ruined a lot of marriages. Almost all of us know someone who's been effected. But more importantly, there are a lot of young people (men and women) that have lives ruined because they get into the business. It's a tough business that thrives on drug abuse to numb the loss of dignity. Maybe it works for you, but to deny the carnage that porn leaves in it's wage is naive.	8

1	I remember that thread. I still don't get how that happened lol.... But it sounds horrifying.	8
1	Yeah same here. A lot of trans people have varying opinions on our lack of ability to have periods. Many hate it as a reminder we will never be completely like cis women. But personally I am glad it is something I don't have to deal with. I don't even want kids, so no reason to worry about it.	8
1	&gt; and then gets 180 million dollars to fight someone.  I agree with the 2 month in jail thing, but not the income part.   However if you are mad that he only served 2 months in jail I think you should be mad at the system, if you went to jail I bet you too would like take advantage of the loopholes to get out faster no?  Now about the income part:  It's not his fault he can make so much money, should people lose a % of their income every time they commit a crime? Should his income be capped? I don't agree.	8

0	While I think the two being in a relationship would be innapropriate, I don't think it's fair to ASSUME he has malicious intent any more than he has good intent.  We don't know why he likes OP. For all we know this is an isolated incident. Saying the reason he likes her is because "she is an easier target" is really not very productive and stimulates unfounded rumour.	8
0	I remember when TwoX was a safer place for women. I miss that time. If you're a woman and you're feeling shit upon in this brogressive joke of a thread, I hope you'll find your way to one of the many smaller subreddits that haven't (apparently) been ruined.   And to all of you who've taken it upon yourselves to crush something that was fragile and lovely, I hope you find someone patient who loves you. And I hope that person shows you what an arrogant and unpleasant person you've been.  Edit: Bring on the downvotes, shitheels. I love them.	8

1	You may not be interested in another cotton tampon alternative after this ridiculous bloodbath experience.  But I will say that I LOVE my sea sponge tampons.  You still have to wash them at work, so it might not be a good solution for you.  But they are reusable, don't stink after a soap-and-water wash, and cost me around $12/year, which is way less than I was spending on single-use tampons.	8
1	Yes, absolutely. Don't ever meet him alone anywhere. Tell your parents. My god, I have a sister your age. If a guy a year younger than me ever hit on her I would crack his fucking skull open. You're young, and still maturing. Please, don't do anything rash or, for lack of a better term stupid.	8
0	"The conference was held in cooperation with ultra-Orthodox organization Machon Yad Ramah...**The conference was intended for neighborhood rabbis (and was not open to the broad public)**".  **Misleading title.** This is a religious conference specifically for local very religious doctors--not an open gynecology conference for all doctors.

If abortion rates and teen births decline, the GOP has nothing left with which to whip their base into an ignorant, frothing, *voting* mass.    It doesn't matter how successful or how common sense or how easy it is to reduce abortion/teen birth rates, the GOP will **never** actually do anything to reduce those rates because they'd lose their last big wedge issue.	8

Women's rights wasn't even fought for until around the 1970's when the first wave feminist movement occurred; the fight for women's rights have occurred as early as the 1800's, but the 20th century was when women's rights finally created a concrete foundation.	8

0	The problem with the word "patriarchy" is that far, far too many people have no idea what it means. Even Wikipedia only has a fraction if it's meaning listed.   Patriarchy is a system which hurts everybody because it not only defines gender roles, it also defines gender obligations and rewards.   Every time somebody uses a slur such as "dick" or "pussy," they are bolstering patriarchal ideas, even. "Act like a man," "act like a lady," are only scratching the surface of it's grip on society.	8
1	&gt;I'm angry eating cookies and watching Adventure Time to calm down  I am impressed at your coping mechanisms. I would not be safe around inanimate objects were I in your shoes. Kudos.   Not that you'd have much luck with legal ramifications on a guy overseas, but I'd save any evidence he gives you in his text back. Some folks are stupid enough to admit to what they did, and he doesn't seem all that smart if he put your name up there.	8
1	So, there IS hope after all! *wipes tears*	8
0	This has never happened to me BUT Been reading from a lot of women who say it did happen to them, and it did NOT wreck their lives, and they were able to go on.  By all means, counseling. But then go on. Obviously, your mom did. You can do this. Don't let one jackass define your life.  ((hugs))	8
1	Use the 'Report video' function on Pornhub, and archive it as evidence.  My second suggestion is to file a complaint with your local PD, *even if* your ex doesn't come back, so that there's a record.	8
1	&gt;This kind of attitude is how reasonable ~~men~~ people get turned off from giving a shit about gender issues altogether.      FTFY.      I'm a woman and I'm sick to death of this crap. I'm not a feminist, nor do I have to be. I have only to be what **I** choose for myself.	8
0	Hate to break it to you but it's not illegal to be romantically involved with a 15 year old. It would be illegal in some states if sexual activity was involved.  He would technically have to wait til she was 16 or 18 depending on the area.  It could also be illegal if he was in a position of trust. Please don't talk law when you obviously don't know it. Thanks.	8
1	Ehhh, the article explains why she was unhappy in her marriage.  She chose to cheat, rather than end her marriage, because that's the easiest route toward her own personal happiness.  She should accept that she's done a shitty thing rather than shift the blame on to her husband and everyone else.  I get it.  I've made a similar mistake.  Everyone has their reasons for cheating and there are very few even *arguably* good ones.  Mostly, it boils down to selfishness and/or cowardice.	8
0	Change the perception? So even though it's a job that caters to men and mostly worked by men they should change the environment they work in so non-existent women applicants can feel better?	8
1	My best friend loves OB tampons- I made the mistake of getting my period at her house once. I found the experience of trying to insert it much like pulling out a dry tampon- but backwards!!!! It hurt so much!!!  I don't understand how she does it.	8
1	"...OK, now everybody take some rubbers."	8
0	How could you possibly know that?! She explicitly said they were friends from work. Put an inept 23 year old who doesn't get any attention from girls his own age in a work environment with a 15 year old who respects him to some extent and a slightly awkward relationship develops, quel fucking surprise!   There is a chance he's a predator, but he's 23, he's young himself, far more likely he's just a bit hopeless, unaccustomed to the attention, and doesn't know what to do with his feelings.	8

1	Why is everyone so terrified of sex ed all of a sudden, anyway? Are people getting different classes than I did?  I mean, here's what I learned:  "This is the cross-section of a penis. This is the cross-section of a vagina. And here are all of the horrible diseases that you'll get if the two ever come into contact with each other. WITH PICTURES HAHAHAHA! Also, condoms are a thing, and they make the horrifying crotch-rot slightly less likely, but they don't work sometimes so never test it or  you'll get space leprosy."	8
1	Hahaha! I love my DivaCup and I'll never go back, but this was excellent, well put :)	8
1	You don't have to be friends with everyone. Honestly, this guy was acting like a grade school kid, insulting your music tastes and following you around. He could have very easily said "Hey, I'd like to get to know you. When do you have some free time?"   I've told people to buzz off for far less than what he did, and I'm not an introvert. You did nothing wrong, OP.	8
0	Whether or not the girl was raped, the mayor did say "I always have encouraged women not to walk alone, to have someone with them at all times, because that in itself is an invitation for someone to take advantage of you,".	8
1	You did the right thing. Women everywhere need to look out for each other. &lt;3  Also, don't you dare forget what you saw. It clearly had an impact on you. The question is, what are you going to do with it? Get counseling if you feel you need it, but you have the metaphorical balls to stop a rape, then you have the balls to do great things with your life. Don't stop there. :)	8
0	Jezebel is verrrry uneven. I tend to notice better stuff by certain writers.	8
0	I agree it was statutory rape. The person I responded to seemed to be suggesting it was also a forcible rape.	8
1	Not just women, but everyone should look out for one another.  I don t need counseling now, but maybe I will in the future. All I want is my fellow humans to be happy in safe. Spread the love, hopefully they will spread it too.	8

1	That's a bit misleading. While there is no 'cure' for pedophilia, there are therapeutic programs that can help people deal with their sexual impulses through cognitive-behavioral training and by counselling them on how to act in high-risk environments.   The suppression of the sexual drive through medication (i.e. chemical castration) is one approach of dealing with the issue but it's far from the only one.	8
1	I'm not sure it's slander when she was the one who admitted it.  Rape or not, it was scumbag behavior on her part and the speech afterwards (which she received applause for) where she joked about the dude's sexual prowess, or lack thereof due to being so drunk he was passing out, and spun it into some life changing learning experience kinda made it worse imo.	8
1	If they do a Carol Danvers movie, then it better be Captain Marvel. For a start, I don't think anyone would take the old school Ms Marvel costume seriously. And then there's the fact that Kamala Khan is the most adorkable Ms Marvel on the planet	8

0	Your instincts are good, but you should really read the piece.  It's a long-form completely out of step with everything you've probably ever read on that site.	8
1	This is getting awfully close to saying everyone, or at least all men, are rapists. Of course you can control your sexual drive, that's why everyone isn't going around raping everyone they find attractive.	8
1	I think it's wrong. Passing the test is a job requirement. She didn't pass the test. She doesn't have the job requirement. Hiring her sets a bad example and has nothing to do with equality. It's special treatment, not equality. Lowering the standards in a job that requires certain skills for life and death situations is a very bad call.	8
0	No he didn't paid his debts to society. His punisment were to lenient. He hasn't learned anything, because he keeps doing that. He is still a ciminal because no sentence so far stopped him from repeatedly commiting the same crime.	8
1	I realize you might not mean that from a malicious place, but eating disorders are not a conscious decision to mutilate one's body. There are mental and psychological factors that come into play, and the physical actions of altering eating habits are the symptom of other painful components in the person's life.	8

1	Probably not a good idea to mess around with extra dosages of birth control. There's lots of nasty things that could happen and no guarantee it will do what you want.   Also not a good idea to rely on miscarriage. I've had three miscarriages while trying to get pregnant while my mom had three kids back to back. All three of us were accidents. God has kind of a sick sense of humor.	8

He'd get shit from his co-workers for being weak and slow, but that'd be the end of it.   Edit: Does anyone know what the word "if" means? I'm outlining how there would be no media coverage if the rule change occurred for a man instead of a woman.	8
1	Yes, it was seriously awful. She really wanted that baby too so it was heartbreaking for her to get a positive test and then lose it and almost die in the process because her doctors refused to act. I was furious when she told me about it.	8
0	'kay.  Continue to ignore anything that doesn't have a guy front and center.  I'll be enjoying a whole bunch of excellent media that you've dismissed.	8
1	Um, maybe so, but not to me? I wasn't saying it was announced yesterday, just that I had recently read about it.	8
1	I subscribe and definitely think women should be informed on finding a proper fitting bra, but really the only difference I noticed is that my back doesn't hurt as much at the end of the day and certain shirts do fit better.   I still relish taking my bra off every day and curse the underwire lol. Breasts, augmented or natural, are a pain in the neck.   -we're not all shills!-	8
0	Yes. That doesn't change what I said.	8
1	You'd better source info on Freddie being "uncooperative and combative" because the charges brought against the officers said his arrest was UNLAWFUL. Rape victims can either be "uncooperative and combative" or they don't have to fight back at all, they are still victims. FREDDIE WAS STILL A VICTIM.	8
0	I like how firefighters that pass the fitness test can magically carry any and all people out of a burning building like some kind of Hollywood movie, but anyone that falls short is helpless and useless.	8
0	If she is sexually developed then yes, I may not want to hang out with her but I'd definitely enjoy having sex with her. I've seen a couple girls who were absolute bombshells...like I can't stop staring and then someone tells me they are 14 years old (I'm 21) and I just shake my head like wtf? I wouldn't act on it because It's not worth the jail time but it's not like they suddenly become unattractive just because I find out they're 14.	8
1	You have seven kids?! Good gracious you are a strong woman. I'm preggo with #1 and have already told my husband she's going to be an only child because of the horrors of pregnancy.   Did you have them all vaginally? Medicated? If I am asking too many questions please tell me to fuck off and I absolutely will. Just in awe of your fertility and resiliency!	8
1	It's kind of a sad reality, but it is what it is. If you are unable to fulfill the physical demands of a job in which other lives depend on your physical capabilities, you should not be allowed to perform it. Much in the same way that someone paralyzed from the waist down could not be a firefighter, even if they were the best firefighter in the world before they were paralyzed. It is very sad to admit but they would not be capable of fulfilling the duties of the job and would simply be a liability for their fellow firefighters.	8
1	Give her the silent treatment right back, forever.  She's barely family and clearly toxic.   Never answer her calls or texts, but be cordial as can be at mandatory extended family events.  Don't think about her, don't have time for her. Your main objective should be that you want her to mentally strike you off her list of people she can put up or take down a peg on her crazyperson mental ladder.	8
1	&gt; What a ~~fantastic~~ fabulous little touch!	8
0	&gt;under any circumstances, is not ok.  And how's that? Where do you base this definitive logic? "Something is wrong because it's wrong"?  And how is the age the number one thing that matters? "It doesn't matter is he a rapist or a serial killer, first thing that matters is the AGE!!"	8
1	This is "affirmative action" at its worst. It's not proposed by all feminists for sure, and I've often seen it as a "cop out" in dealing with gender issues. Not enough _____ in this field? Prefer hiring them, or in this case let things slide.  Incidentally, this goes both ways at times. Male elementary teachers in canada are practically guarenteed a job if they find an opening. Male high school teachers are heavily preferred for acceptance into teacher's college.	8

I don't see how those things are related. The reasons that people oppose abortion are not a factor in hysterectomies.  &gt;It is. And your vote can help stop that happening.  I think you're trying too hard to get me to support you, but from my perspective, this isn't something I can vote on without considering for a bit. Does that make sense?	8

1	John Lennon is one of the best artists of all time. People can admire the work of a scumbag. Really what needs to happen is people need to start idolizing the work and not the person (if the person is a piece of shit). Where people fail, is how they worship Lennon himself without knowing or acknowledging his disgusting actions. Or they cant separate his work.  It's a thin line I guess. I'm female, and Lennon's history of abuse has made it so I can't think positively about him as a person again. And yet, I can't stop admiring his talent and his work.	8

0	I don't know what else you want me to tell you, there is no magic pill that makes you into a better person.  If you want to change only you have the power to do that.  If you say that you've tried *many* times to change that makes me question how much time you invested into making worthwhile change, but I don't know you or your ethic.    I creeped your subs and you're a very beautiful girl, but that's only going to keep doors open for so long.  I would focus on making changes now so that later in life you're not at a complete disadvantage.	8

1	&gt; It would be akin to OP being romantically interested in a 9-yr old.  Eh, I feel that's a bit unfair. For the same reason that 50 and 57 makes much less of a difference than 23 and 15, 15 and 9 is much more significant than 23 and 15. I tend to see the significance of each year as an exponential graph (with a negative coefficient of x). The significance of each year decreases by multiplying by some factor each year, rather than adding some factor.  Not that it can really be quantified in that way, it's more just a vague concept of how I view things.	8

1	Even if he really "likes" you, **nothing** good can come of this. If he really wanted to *be* with you, he would have been patient and waited until you were at a more appropriate age and in a similar place in life as him (being a high schooler is a completely different life than post H.S.). Sounds to me he is looking for an easy screw.	8
0	It is blamed on political correctness because no pass her will make certain groups (aka SJW) say "omg all firefighters are ultra-sexist, woman-haters and literally worst the hitler for not letting her pass. Its the patriarchy and women are not welcomed on this workfield!".  Groups of people that will take any issue and make it sexism.  I agree, it is not a political correctness issue, but certain people will do it one in order to further their agenda.	8
0	Because apparently he isn't able to learn his lesson otherwise. His laughable low punishment haven't tought him anything. He keeps repeating the same crime. So if that doesn't work, then his punishment must be more sewere to actually work and stop him from commiting the same crime.	8

Could you cut those in half again?"	8
1	I beg to differ. The only reason things like this happen is because the place hiring this girl has to be able to say "see, we hire anyone. Not just white guys." That's all it boils down to. This is irresponsible even if there are laws in place that enforce it.	8

Even when women dominate a particular industry, they are disproportionately underrepresented in positions of leadership.

0	She should not get to pass.	8
1	I'm not trying to be insulting but if a 23 year old is interested in a 15 year old then something is wrong with the 23 year old. There is just too big of a gap in maturity and experiences at those ages, no matter how much he tells you that you're mature for your age.	8
1	Good call. Don't do it, I was older when I met a guy alone and he tried kissing me and feeling me up in his car, it very easily could have been much worse. It's best to bolt in the other direction and cut contact with him if you don't want to tell anyone.	8
1	Could not have said it better myself. Not only do the lives of your co-workers depend on you, but so do the lives of those you serve. These standards were put in place for a reason.

0	Wildly inappropriate. You should tell the head of department, your form (homeroom?) teacher, your year co-ordinator or a school counsellor- basically any trusted person at your school. If they don't take you seriously, keep telling people. Definitely tell your parents. You cannot stop people from looking at your body, people will comment in real life, but school should be a safe environment for you. A teacher should never comment on a student's body unless there is cause for concern, and even then never in front of the rest of the class.	8

0	Why can't they? As it stands the embryo wouldn't be born unless someone actively brings them to term. This isn't a passive process or a process depending on both people, this is something that one person could undertake on their own.

1	I totally understand.  Just wanted to offer an option in case you were interested.  : )	8
1	Many people here are feminists and against this decision. I'm a feminist and I think this is contrary to feminism because it propagates the idea that women need special treatment. That's bogus and not what feminism is for.  Feminism is not about putting innocent people in jeopardy. It's about removing unfair obstacles -- no one thinks making her pass the same physical fitness test as anyone else is unfair.	8
1	EWWWWWWWW  If he's 23 and going after 15 year olds it's because women his own age won't touch him. When I was 23 I thought 15 year olds were universally annoying shit heads (and you may be very mature for your age, but you are still 15 and therefore probably irritating to most people in their 20's)	8
1	&gt; You couldn't be more wrong. Most firefighters will go into that building without a second thought because that's what we are paid to do.  I didn't mean to imply that another firefighter wouldn't still do their job, I am sure most firefighters would, it was more about the fact that if someone is willing to put themselves in danger like that, they deserve to have people capable of backing them outside the building.	8

1	I have migraines that are triggered by hormone swings (but no aura, so no increased risk of thrombosis/stroke). Back in high school they used to keep me home from school they were so bad. In college, I had one so bad that I slept for 27 hours. My obgyn put me on the pill and told me to skip the placebo weeks and take the pills continuously.  I haven't had a period since 2008 and it is glorious. I really am dreading the day when my husband and I start trying to conceive.	8

0	No.  They thought they were having sex with the person they talked to on the phone and arranged to have sex with.  And that is who they had sex with.  He simply looked differently than what he claimed to look like.  I guess, in your mind, what makes the "person"?  It seems you think the way a person looks physically defines that person.  That seems odd to me.  Isn't it the person's mind, thoughts, feelings, etc. that really define who a person is?	8
1	I agree with your husband. I, comic book lover and woman, strongly disliked Agent Carter, though I found Hayley's characterization good, I mostly had issues with the overall writing and theme, and I found their 'feminist' take really ham-handed.	8
1	Good to know. A white girl in my engineering classes who just barely missed the cut for a really sweet scholarship sued the state after she found out that racial minority students had a different bar to clear to be awarded the same scholarship. It was a state-funded scholarship.   I think she won. And if she did, I'm glad.   Admissions discrimination is one thing (though I think for state schools it should be illegal). Criterion-based scholarships are a different thing entirely.	8
1	I was in a similar situation when I was 14 and it ended very badly. Please, don't call yourself stupid! It's not your fault that you believe a guy who seems sweet and is calling you beautiful. I didn't think there was anything wrong with it either, just thought I was so cool for having older guy friends who wanted to "be with me."   But please DO take my advice and stop talking to him. Tell someone you trust in case it goes south, but just get yourself out of that situation.	8
0	ugh and your reaction is just as sickening by using the word "ugh" and "gross" I am imagining the most camp person on earth  I am not suggesting she sticks around for 4 years to see if he leaves, but if he is legit then I don't give a fuck about 15+ with anyone.  If he isn't, and this is sounding like he is kinda obsessed and isn't, then no.	8
0	This is sounding exactly like anti gay talking points. Can you actually look at what you're saying? And gay conversion therapy doesn't necessarily focus on forgetting being gay and being straight, it too is a form of suppression and trying to live a straight life instead of "acting on impulses". Other religions also advocate what you're suggesting for gay people.	8

1	While I think diversity is important, those fitness tests are there for a reason, and unless you can show the tests are designed to discriminate against women, this should not be controversial.  If her academic scores are so good, there must be another way she can serve within the FDNY besides carrying a 200lb man out of a flaming building, right?	8
1	Feminism is becoming more and more toxic because the "vocal minority" i.e. tumblr radicals are becoming an increasingly larger portion of modern day feminists. It's an unfortunate for the sane people who are actually in favor of gender equality and addressing legitimate issues, but the movement has been tainted in may people's eyes because of extremists like these.	8
1	They are suppose to be overkill for the job. You want people who can handle it when something goes wrong. If your standard only tests for an average work day then you've got big problems whenever something goes wrong.   Would you rather have lower standards and fire fighters who can do the job properly 95% of the time or have crazy high standards and have fire fighters who can get the job done 100% of the time?	8
1	It would be akin to OP being romantically interested in a 9-yr old. Super weird. Red flags all over.   At 23, I remember feeling weird dating 19-year olds, this guy knows exactly what he's doing.	8

0	Personally, I've been advising engaged couples to skip that ring all together if you are both ok with the idea. There was no such thing as an engagement ring until jewelers decided they wanted to sell more rings and made up the idea of another ring for the engagement. They keep telling us that it's a symbol of how much a man loves and cares about his future wife, but there is absolutely no correlation between the price/percentage of income spent on a ring and the love between two people or how long their marriage will last.	8

0	If a woman chooses to wear modest clothing,  that's her choice. The LDS church doesn't force anyone to do anything.

1	Making people "casually" aware you have a problem can either count as a cry for help, or a form of self-inflicted social pressure.  In this case, it sounds more like the latter (since no one can really *do* anything for him, except provide moral support).  As a form of social pressure - If his friends know he has a problem, they'll actively help him avoid temptation - They won't unknowingly leave him alone chaperoning a sleepover of their little sisters.	8
0	Stacey Dash is a tool	8
0	Yeah, I'm not going to spin a bunch of potential stories of how this might be an organic thing genuinely unrelated to age.  Let's just maybe assume that your POV isn't the only one that exists on a planet of billions of people and stipulate that it's *possible* a 23 year old could be interested romantically in a 15 year old without being a mustache twirling villain who wants to fuck her and tie her to the railroad tracks or whatever.        Surely, we can stipulate that's *possible*, no?	8
0	Maybe the boyfriend's dad thought this first interaction was a group date and that's why he wanted to add you on Facebook. I'd un-friend him immediately. That would be a start to salvage your relationship with your friend.	8
1	Yay, pads! I'm a pads person too.	8
1	Thanks for pointing that out. It's 18.5 - 33 and 14.5 - 17 if you are calculating her age to be 15.5 for the upper limit and his to be 23.5 for the upper limit. You would call someone who was 18.5 "eighteen years old" and the same for 14.5.  So she can date from 14-17, and he can date from 18-33.	8
1	Exactly. BIL recently told my husband that they've been "relying on the pull-out method" for last year+...It's amazing there isn't a child *already.*	8
0	The point I'm trying to argue is that there are rarely hard physical standards for physical jobs. "Being able to carry a 180lb person" sounds like a reasonable standard for a firefighter, until you find out that the median male weight 15lbs more than that, and the median female weight 15lbs less, which makes that standard completely arbitrary. That's probably why it was dropped from the standards after only a few years.	8
0	In 31 states (according to a chart I saw that might not be completely current) the age of consent is 16.  I'm too lazy to really research it (as opposed to counting the number of "16's" in a column) but I do believe that in some of those states they put a limit on the difference in the number of years between the 2 parties.  OTH, it's late and I might be thinking about provisional driver's licenses or something so I'm outta here.  Have a nice night.	8

I mean, gosh, Reddit is where the guy with two penises did an AMA and not only answered all the questions that most people would be dying in real life to ask (but might not ask in real life) but he even posted a picture for everyone to see. I think I'm personally more willing to be understanding of invasive/personal questions just because of the nature of Reddit. As for the constructive criticism, yeah, that's just uncalled for.

The design of the ring is beveled to give the illusion of diamond chips from far away, while not actually containing diamonds.  I chose the [claddagh style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claddagh_ring) because of the symbolism and history.    I've only once had someone make negative comments about my rings (a nail salon tech while I was getting a manicure).  After explaining the symbolism and meaning the attitude changed to "Oh my god that's so sweet!"	8
0	Contract says they both have to consent. End of story.   Does bring up a good point though. Why does a women get to choose to bring an embryo to term but the man doesn't when it's natural. A guy should have equal chance to choose if he wants to be a parent and right now men don't have the right.	8
1	Because they changed *her* requirements.  It says in black and white that this is the first time, ever, that a failure has been allowed to continue.  The other 305 are competent.  The 44 women who passed before her are competent.  She's the only one who can't hack it.  Why are you so quick to defend something that's obviously ridiculous?  If your job is lifting people and you can't lift people, then you can't do the job.  The fact that we're even arguing this is fucking retarded.	8

0	That's because 75% of the NFL is guilty of domestic abuse.  The best they can do is make an example of someone when a story goes viral, but they can't seriously investigate every player or every allegation--the league would crumble.  Manslaughter is a separate issue, but I was under the impression that everyone with allegations beat their cases.  Innocent to the court should be treated as innocent to an employer.  The rapes I know nothing about.  Scary stuff, but if you've done your time I suppose you should be allowed to go back to work--especially since there aren't women in the NFL workplace.	8

0	I haven't assumed either way, but on the balance of probabilities, which is more likely?  * The teacher was calling OP a diva, and phrased it in a way that was trying to be funny.  * The teacher wants to get fired, never work again as a teacher and possibly be put on a sex offenders register for sexual harrassment of a minor, so they make sexual comments about OP infront of their entire class.	8

0	Yes, the biopsychosocial model is applicable to all mental health disorders. This one is just more biologically driven than say disorders of civilization like MDD, which is why drug therapy is more efficacious and effective than it is for other disorders.  Some patients never fully recover from treatable disorders and have to go on maintenance therapy for their entire lives. That might be what is being alluded to here.	8
1	Absolutely.  If she says no, he'll threaten to tell her parents about the weed (even though it makes no sense).  If she does anything at all, he'll use it to threaten to tell her parents.  "What will your parents think if I told them you kissed/whatever me?"  It's easier for a 15 year old to just go a little farther than take that risk.  And a little farther continues until it's literally whatever he wants.	8

0	Whoa are there any girls left on TwoX? These comments are a pile of dismissive bullshit.	8
1	"Throw me to the wolves and I will return leading the pack."  Edit: Wow! Gold? Thanks kind stranger :) Made my day!	8
0	I never said they didn't have the right to not do that. I just think it is morally reprehensible.	8
1	Ironically, some want to make it law that businesses in America have a certain number of women in leadership positions, for reasons that follow the same theme as the reviewer's advice. Here, it's *sexist*. In other situations, it's *progressive.*	8
1	Please, go see a doctor. If you had bleeding that long after starting to become sexually active, and are still having pain today, don't ask strangers on the internet for medical advice. Go see your doctor. Please.	8
1	It all comes down to this - you are not supporting her choice, therefore you are being unsupportive in a [Support] post, ergo you are breaking the rules.	8
0	It's scary realizing you're growing up. A lot of girls have feelings for a guy after they've been "intimate" with him.   You're definitely overreacting, but then again you're 15 and I would've  probably reacted somewhat similarly. On Monday, go back to school. If Ben says anything, apologize for slapping him and say you overreacted out of surprise. Then move on. This is one kiss in a series of many. When you're older, it will be a funny story.	8
0	I'm with you! Can't believe people are suggesting the police should get involved. Yes, it's inappropriate for him to court her, but it is not criminal that he's attracted to her. Good lord.	8
0	Can't they see that this actually supports sexism... I know it's just one case but if more women are going to become firefighters without passing all the tests, people are not going to want to be saved by female firefighters anymore...	8
0	Good.  You are waking up to the truth of how much of a shit hole this website is.  Enjoy.	8
0	Ok sure. It's against the law. I'm just saying that if the genders were switched, nothing would change. Rape or not lawfully, nothing would change. If what's happening here is illegal, it'd be illegal if it were the other way around  Edit: strange how I'M the one playing devils advocate here.	8
1	"This shit is expensive!" "It's the last of my stash and it's hard to find more, my last guy got busted". Don't let them guilt trip you!	8
1	I'm gonna say refrain from giving medical advice and defer that to doctor, but from my experience skipping the placebo week long term, I still had some breakthrough bleeding the first month or two since my body wasn't able to go from 100% to nothing in one cycle.  If you decide to do that, bring along some backup clothes/supplies/whatever you need just in case. :)	8
1	I genuinely found ABTF helpful, but it pisses me right the fuck off when the top comment in discussions about breast implants is shilling that sub. It's not about your bra size, it's most often about a lack of confidence and being unable to buy clothes that fit properly. Before my implants, I had two choices: shirts that were baggy in the chest or shirts that exposed my midriff. There was no in-between.	8
1	Not to be all preachy and "like my thing!!!!(crazy eyes)!!!!" at you, but ob is so much more comfortable and better fitting that it's worth a bloody finger. I just wipe off the visible blood in the stall then wash my hands.	8
1	Do you actually believe it's that difficult for most people to tell if a stranger wants to continue a conversation with them or not?	8
1	I mean, if her son is actually exhibiting signs of addiction (i.e. doesn't do his homework, skips out on spending time with friends or family, etc.) then really it doesn't matter if he's watching brazzers or staring at a catalog.  Unfortunately, this woman is probably just upset that her son has sexual desires.	8
0	Can we please not trivialize domestic violence with these two word answers that play down the gravity of the crimes? I'm just sick and tired of our society not putting enough weight and thought on these issues and when you come on here expecting better, it just breaks my heart and drives me to depression.	8
0	pack everything up, people. thetemporalvoid is pretty confident. nothing left to see here, go home to your families.	8
1	I think by "great spy" OP just meant good at gathering info and acting on it to sabotage plans	8
0	This person is insane :p	8
0	In real life most people don't halt what they're doing and ask for express verbal consent before sex. From the story it seems like they were hooking up, both enjoying it, and it progressed naturally to sex. There is nothing to suggest either one of them did not consent.	8
1	I just bought five athletic-fit button up shirts, thank god I'm having them delivered to my home in a plain, brown package.  I'd be so embarrassed having to pick them up at the store and have everyone know I look at their catalog...	8
0	Does it make me a bad person if i find it funny that this is posted on two x chromosomes?	8
0	No, it's nearly all.  Not really an open subject.	8
0	The romantic period came after the crusades, which brought tales of men wooing women, sending them letter, etc... This was a foreign idea for the Christianized Europe at the time and it became slowly popularized. Like all fashionable things, what starts in the upper class eventually makes its way into the lower class.  You don't need to "thank" Islam or anything, but it was ahead of its time and it doesn't hurt to acknowledge it.	8
0	This could quite literally ruin the rest of his life if it progressed to sex or anything of that nature. He'd face jail time and being on the sex offenders' registry for years if charges were pressed.   My philosophy has always been "If it seems weird and you have to rationalize it, it's probably not right." This goes for clothes and guys.	8
1	Speaking as someone who was stillborn and resuscitated, I'm awfully glad my mom was in a hospital.	8
0	My brother, whom is now a paid firefighter, looked all over the country for open positions, and only rarely found positions that he would even have a chance of getting, because of the extreme competition for paid positions. Considering that, I have no idea how this woman even got the position in the first place. If she didn't reach the bar then she should have been cut and one of the other 100 applicants would have gotten the position, man or woman. The whole thing seems eerily familiar to the special treatment of those who give lots of money to police departments, whom then allow the donors to become police officers.	8
1	I am from the UK your democrats are further right than our conservatives	8

1	This.  It blows my mind how many people are saying that he would have done years if he wasn't rich.  He wouldn't have done ANY time if he wasn't a public figure	8
1	It certainly is a strange feeling.   But there's not much i can do about it, I'll never be able to completely remove it so Ill just have to live with it.	8
1	I'm not even sure that is (only) a TwoX thing...	8
1	My thing is, this guy can have kids with whoever he wants. And if he did have children from the embryos, would he be able to sue her for child support or something?  It just seems to me like he's obsessed with her and wants to keep her in his life for as long as he can.	8
0	Name any albums of his other than imagine.  Big fans of his can, the majority of people can't. He rode his beetles fame into superstardom, released one great album, and ten trash albums that almost no one remembers.  Not saying Lennon is a shitty artist, obviously he's not, just saying his success as a solo artist gets blown out of proportion because he had one mega famous album	8
0	Actually, something like that happened on /r/skincareaddiction, which is a pretty popular sub, so maybe people are a bit wary. It turned out one of the most active mods was getting sponsored to promote certain products. I don't think the cup enthusiasm is the same, but there is certainly precedent for it.	8
1	How menu languages do you speak alright? Infernal isn't fucking easy ok. Mandarin? Fuck Mandarin it's like Infernal for retards.	8
0	&gt; you kind of know yourself  Know what?	8
0	It's nice that you don't get offended about a scenario that is *nothing like what I asked*.	8
0	Yeah and then he's going to go mad, spiral down into a "me against the world" mentality, get sexually frustrated as well, and end up saying "fuck it, nobody understands me, nobody cares about me, so why should I care about anyone, I might as well do this and that to a child."  Your advice is the absolute worst possible, to be frank.	8
1	You're not stupid, you're just young. Never meet him alone anywhere, especially not inside of his car.	8
1	Wait, the "worse" thing is that he kissed a girl ?	8
1	I wish I could be as open-minded as the rest of the comments but I wouldn't trust him not to act. And the fact he doesn't want to change it makes it even more dubious.	8
0	&gt; I can find very, very few instances of people doing the same job for the same length of time with different wages to women.  ?  I agree with that...what I'm saying is, nobody is saying "oh she's a woman pay her less."  That *doesn't* mean nobody should care about the wage gap.  The disparate effect, regardless of cause, merits looking into, and it's a disadvantage to women even without that intent.  Similarly, the fact that people aren't targeting people for violence *because of* their gender doesn't mean people should ignore the disparate effect, and the fact that it's a disadvantage to men.	8
0	you mean such a person should be on some kind of register? you could apply that logic to any sort of crime. If someone stole from their employer, should their crime be public knowledge so no-one will ever hire them again? the 'risk' of being involved with anyone is implicit in the very act, someone who has never before committed domestic abuse can nevertheless comit such an act.  to do this, you're basically precluding any chance someone has of re-integrating into society.	8
1	Seriously? You're telling someone with PTSD to 'toughen up'?	8
1	ah, you're one of those babies that really wanted to be here, huh? were you grounded for the first 10 years of life? that's my plan for this one. also, why does it sound so adorable when you word cuddling up to the iud like that?	8
0	How does it indicate any of that? In the end it's just a different kind of clothes. There's no jump in skill requirement to wear them.	8

0	But OPs ex has never acted on the tendencies so what more would therapy help with?	8
1	If it's for a college assignment there probably was some boilerplate in the contract you signed when you agreed to go to school there that said they had the rights to any works created as part of a classroom learning environment.	8
0	Or Amy Schumer, just to cover both sets of plumbing	8
1	How is a "wait and see" attitude an acceptable way to treat a pregnant woman? "You might die, or it might be nothing or you might deliver a stillborn baby. Lets just wait and see so I don't have to think of the possibility of referring you to someone to terminate an inviable pregnancy." Seriously, they need their licenses revoked.	8
1	lol the article should be titled rebecca wax becomes the least physically qualified firefighter in new york city history. other girls did the test right so she deserves no mercy.	8
1	The paper falls under social and psychological sciences.  In which case the authorship is ABSOLUTELY considered when you are to account for bias. She wasn't isolating a signaling pathway, or measuring the intensity of a cytochemical stain in new conditions.    She was commenting on a social phenomena directly related to herself.   Yeah the reviewer was stupidly crass, but don't worry, he "caused her distress", he is fired now.	8
1	Yeah, when I was reading this article I couldn't help but see it as confirmation/justification of "hysterical woman" stereotypes.	8
0	Correction.  Loser men at that age cant get women their own age.  I had 0 issues having constant hookups at that age back in 2010.	8
1	I'm glad most of the comments on here are supportive, but I'm shocked by the people condemning this as snooping. I consider snooping something that involves accessing a password protected account or going through someone's phone. Reddit profiles are public and accessible anywhere...period. This is why people create throwaways, and if this guy wasn't smart enough to do that, that's his problem.	8
0	Yes but finding out doesn't retcon out the attraction you felt towards them.	8
0	&gt; I can't imagine someone actually wrote something this incredibly stupid.  ... and 350 people upvoting.    Edit: lol, 1500 now. This is one of those moments where it's very difficult not to get the impression that most people are, in fact, morons. A 23yo being attracted to a 15yo isn't pedophilia ffs, 15yo to a 9yo is.	8
1	I doubt you would be grounded at all if you told your parents even if you were there are worse things than being grounded. Being interested in somebody a fraction of your age is abnormal, if he has one abnormal behavior he probably has more. Even if he is safe a relationship in which one person is 50% older than the other would never work. If you are confident he is safe and this will be fine just convince your parents.	8
0	&gt; The fact that nobody seems all that much about Mayweather’s own well-documented history of violence—a history that spans over 10 years and five different women—proves that when the stakes are high enough, a domestic battery doesn’t have to hurt you career.   &gt; …   &gt; Mayweather has been accused of assaulting five different women, at least seven different times, as documented by a collection witness statements, police reports and legal proceedings.  He &amp; Chris Brown should go bowling.	8
0	Seriously, this is a real comment.   Are you almost 16? He's just turned 23?  There's a real difference between that and you just turned 15 and he's turning 24 soon.  Anyways, the best thing you can do for yourself (and maybe him too) is wait just 2-3 short years. IF he still seems awesome then at that point nobody really cares that much about the age difference.	8
1	&gt; So please: everybody deserves respect.  Ha! No. Respect is earned.	8
0	But the motive and reason for me doing it are the same as the other people. Where is the line of appropriately and non-appropriately	8
0	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Europe  Read it  Not sure why OP and everyone else is acting like she's dealing with the worst person in earth, I'll assume she's American.	8
1	This isn't feminism, Jesus fucking Christ...	8
1	Im late to comment but surprised no one has called this out specifically.   if the dude makes a move, he's committing [statuatory rape](http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/08/sr/statelaws/statelaws.shtml#California).   That's law for CA but it's pretty universal in the states. Check it.  Avoid this guy at all cost. You have your whole life and a sea of guys in your future.	8
0	But why is it inappropriate?  Because it's illegal?  Is everything illegal also inappropriate?	8
1	that scares me more then anything, granted I don't live in NY, but I would be awfully scared if the firefighters here were just let in without the proper requirements.	8
0	We have just found out about a similar situation that happened in the Philadelphia fire department. A female firefighter was killed recently and it came out the fellow female firefighter on the truck got pushed through the academy. That does not seem to be the only problem that happened that night, but you really need to be able to rely on your crew...	8
1	It's probably a type of niche porn, yes.  But it's extremely different to have cam shows posted on porn sites (when you're camming, you know there's definitely a possibility that your show will end up on some porn site, and many camgirls use it to their advantage), than some video you never consented to being recorded, or that was recorded but only for you and your partner's enjoyment.	8
0	We don't charge people with a crime just because someone saw them walk down the same street. Even when women can name their rapists many of them walk.   As I said, you aren't qualified to make that assumption.	8
0	I wonder if additional training could get her to the level at which she would pass the test	8
1	the comment you replied to is talking about the Instead cup, I think.	8
1	&gt; Not really, most domestic violence offenses are around 180 days max conviction, depending on history.  Yes, and when this is your *5th domestic abuse case* ...?  The history clearly indicates someone who breaks the law, abuses women and does not change. If it was anyone else but a massive celebrity they would have been serving time for years, at a minimum.	8
0	Always telling boys to not be a rapist obviously would have some effects on being a rapist as the outcome.   However, telling an adult man who has spent a large portion of his life thinking "when shes drunk it doesnt count as rape" not to be a rapist should be just fine.	8
1	Yeah, that's definitely *not* how I took it in the movie. I took it as her saying she was a monster because of what they made her, and a large part of that was the sterilization.	8
1	You forgot the most helpful piece of advice: "You just have to be comfortable with your body! There's nothing dirty or bad about menstruating!" Seriously, that was the most annoying part for me, the forum posters who acted like if I couldn't get it to work I was somehow not sexually liberated or comfortable with my femininity. Sorry I'm not jumping for joy at having fetid uterus blood running down my arm, pouring off my elbow onto the floor of a public bathroom.   Also, the person who said to use the blood to fertilize houseplants.	8
0	Yes, I can imagine why. I wouldn't do it myself. A cousin of mine married a woman 9 years younger, 31 and 22. This example is anecdotal, and I'm not enforcing the idea any further than that this age gap thing is not weird. That, and culture difference. In my culture, even 10 years difference is not weird.  Sorry if my comment was harmful. Didn't mean it to be.	8
0	Send more women to fight Taliban in Tora bora, cause its equality.	8
0	So reverse discrimination is cool with you?	8
1	The person carrying the fetus.	8
1	I wasn't trying to rebut it, just add some additional information to it.  Your point is correct that homebirth is an option (and often better for getting the birth plan you hoped for), it's just unfortunately not always as straight forward as I think some people assume it is.	8
1	It wasn't your fault. He orchestrated this entire thing so that *he* was in control of the situation. Getting you to agree to go along in *his* car and offering to buy a drink on *his* dime were both parts of his plan to make you do what he wanted. He got you to talk about your sex life in order to make you feel like you were contributing to a sexually charged atmosphere. He did all of these things in order to manipulate you into giving into him later.  Getting in his car, accepting a drink, and talking about sex do not give him permission to pressure and touch you the way he did.	8
1	Not that this was the case here, but I knew a guy that was a firefighter and he said there was some debate about lowering the standards in general for a firefighting position. The argument was that the standards were too high for just about any woman to pass, But also were generally overkill for the job. I have no statistics either way but I think it would be worth exploring lowering the standards FOR EVERYONE.	8
1	They are definitely not 'standard of care' - a statement that implies an action is considered the bare minimum for a situation. However, they remain an important technique in the obstetrician's arsenal. You'll likely see a couple during your clerkship/Sub-Is.  Fundamentally, soft tissue is rarely the barrier to a birth. As this has become more widely accepted, the number of episiotomies has declined	8
1	Wow.  It's like the abortion under ground railroad.	8
1	Among the witnesses were his own fucking children.	8
1	Yep, but that's the problem with immoral people hiding behind their religion.  Their actions are not immoral to them if they're really just doing "God's will".	8
1	'Her's' is a strange thing to say when the embryo is made up of both their parts...	8
0	That's egalitarianism, feminism deals specifically with gender equality.	8
1	Then she should have divorced him THEN slept with the man, she deserves all the scrutiny she gets.	8
1	Sometimes it feels like high school is a state of mind...	8
1	Honestly! This approach is so much more harmful. And is she trying to imply that mothers need to worry about their own sons viewing them sexually?	8
0	I mean... I don't think lying should be illegal.	8
1	Yes. At the time it awesome and flattering, but then when you get close to the age they were at the time, and observe people that are the age you were, it becomes very obvious how sketchy the situation was. Op, I would recommend trying to just not talk to him, and if he becomes persistent, tell an adult you can trust.	8
1	Uhh...no, sorry.  I converted to IUDism.  Try the neighbors' house.	8
0	Are you saying that no woman is capable of following that advice? Surely you can understand that for some people, this could have been useful. It's not easy for everyone to follow (it's probably possible), but for those it did help, it's worth it.   There, I clearly countered and nullified your point. Do you have a different one?	8
1	He's grooming you. Listen to the others and don't fall for it.	8
1	You are NOT stupid; you are 15, and inexperienced.  You are smart enough for this situation to be setting off your radar and asking a community for opinions.  Talk to your parents.  Stay away from this man.	8
1	That video is rough to watch. If I was her I'd be mad at both the doctor and the mother. She just waves the doctor on and he then hacks away at her.	8
1	Then there needs to be a separate physical requirement for those positions that are not as physical and where academics are preferred. Maybe it's something that needs to be looked at and revamped, but hiring someone who failed the job qualifications just looks bad.	8
0	If we're sitting on a jury, yes. If I'm sitting on my couch deciding what to watch on tv, then not really.	8
0	Your whole tangent about women was derailing lol. Just seemed defensive. Of course, I think this behavior can lead to abuse in both sexes- it often comes from jealousy rather than hate.	8
0	You're borderline creepy. Sounds right.	8
0	So you think I should make him apologize and then find out if he kissed me because he likes me and don't say anything about me liking him unless I know he likes me first? Is that it?	8
1	that's a great story. if i were you (and i am being 100% serious) i would write a book about your life. if you can't write well i would hire someone to ghost write it for you. this is a natural for being turned into a movie. i guarantee it would be a great success, and you would become rich. i would also say "a percentage of each book goes to help the wolf sanctuary" you would be on every talk show in the world. i would really consider doing this if i were you.	8
1	Snackman is a personal hero	8
0	From a strictly professional point of view, I'm a non commissioned police employee and I would wonder if women would need to bring in paperwork..It's quite common for officers to "document" incidents and leave a paper trail but the incidents are not submitted for prosecution. I wonder if that could be a method for these incidents or if it would have to be a full blown investigation etc....And I'm pro-choice so I'm not advocating this just responding in the spirit of the question	8
0	Yes, obviously repeat offenders mean there are more victims than perpetrators, but considering how common rape, abuse and assault are I'm quite confident most people know someone who has perpetrated such crimes.	8
0	There have been a lot of studies proving head trama causes irrational behavior. Something about getting hit in the fontal lobe damages the part of the brain that regulates thoughts. This could attribute to the Mayweather case and people shouldn't be so harsh when it comes to judging him.	8
1	Yes they can. On average, no, but women can be strong enough to pass tests of physical strength and endurance.	8
0	Why isn't it ok though?	8
1	Well, that's part of it. With somebody like Chris Brown, whose work we don't like, everybody jumps on their white horse and trumpets the news until everybody knows. With Bill Murray, whom we find funny, everybody just shrugs and keeps quiet. And that's the reason you don't know. Because he made some good jokes in Ghostbusters.	8
0	I don't think there's anything wrong with someone not calling themselves a feminist - there are plenty of valid reasons for that - but people who are actually *anti-feminist*? They're a problem.	8
1	Yep, right by the gayborhood. Definitely going to have to check it out once it's open.	8
0	Weirdly it's her mom telling the doctor to do it.	8
0	That's a really shit thing to say.  Bras leave marks. That's what they do because they have to be tight enough to support your breasts. Most of the support is coming from the chest band (or it should be) and yeah. It doesn't mean you're fat. It doesn't meany anything about you.  Go to the gym if you want to for yourself.  Don't go because your boyfriend was a thoughtless asshole who made you cry.	8
0	&gt;.. why date someone fucked up?   Because the chances are high that you're a little fucked up in your own way too. We're all a little fucked up and lonely and it feels a little better to be just fucked up instead.	8

1	John Lennon is so much more of a dick than most people realize. He abused both his wives plus some of his domestic servants. He cheated on his first with with Yoko Ono and mistreated his son. I don't know how he turned into the icon that he is today.	8
0	there's nothing ethically wrong with the desire but there is something morally wrong with it.	8
0	There are a lot of factors that go into wanting a baby. People usually consider their financial state, the stability of their relationship, etc. It's not like a child who blindly wants a pony and fails to think through the practicalities.  Just because they were looking forward to this baby doesn't mean she would have wished to be put on life support. This is why it is important for everyone to have an advance directive. If you don't document your wishes, everyone will project their own desires onto you.	8
0	She could, but she couldn't run up the stairs and drag the dummy around in the arbitrary 18 minute time period allotted. It took her 22. I don't know if that would be the difference between life and death.	8
0	No it would not!   9 year old's are usually not started puberty while it would not be uncommon for a 15 year old girl to be done with it.   Your culture might be different from others,and I'm not saying they should marry and have kids. But your statemet is flawed. Morally it can be dubious to some, but it's normal human nature.	8
1	this is a joke. I certainly wouldn't want her to be the one that is tasked with saving me from a burning building, although i suppose it's better than nobody coming to save me! and yes, she not only endangers her life, the life of people that need help, but also of her co-workers who will have to save her weak ass when she can't do the job. I'm sure she will be well-known by the time she gets hired. it probably won't be be peachy until she proves herself. good luck!	8
0	The things he's telling you (you're special, so mature, etc) are *classic* pick up lines for older men seeking younger women/teenagers.  That's their script.  If you were 23, would you date a 15 year old?  A 23 year old can legally drink, drive a car, finishing college or has full time employment and is supporting themselves, paying their own bills, planning for future marriage/family etc.  You're still growing!  At best, he is an emotionally stunted guy who can't relate to people his own age, and at worst a predator who likes to pursue and manipulate girls.	8
1	Speak for yourself (op and CNN) because I don't know who the fuck "we" are supposed to be.	8
0	I think that it's kind of a subtle call to the fact that the wives/spouses of those coaches perpetually keep themselves pickled, maybe blinding themselves to the real issues.  What do you guys think?	8
0	It is up to the training instructors and administrators to make sure that the firefighters maintain the physical and mental abilities required to save lives, if her grades make up for her physical weaknesses then hopefully they will put her in a position that uses her abilities.	8
0	Holy sh!t, that's even worse!	8
1	http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32591260  &gt;Many called him sexist and misogynistic and said he had done a "hatchet job" on Black Widow, also known as Natasha Romanoff. One asked why the words "strong female character" were not in his vocabulary.	8
0	This exact same test? Every firefighter? Every year?	8
0	He's a fucking creep.	8
1	Right? It's very weird. Men complain that they want casual sex, yet shame women who do. It's a very odd behavior.	8
1	"Hey, I feel like we didn't really complete our conversation the other day and I don't want there to be any miscommunication or confusion.  I just wanted to let you know that I am not planning on being involved in your bachelorette party.  I don't want to be responsible for something like that, and it is not something that interests me.  But I appreciate you thinking of me."	8
0	Isn't the "can't help what he is attracted to" attitude a little animalistic?	8
0	Said nothing about the economic justification for Vegas. I just implied that fighting a dude doesn't constitute, "earning" such a large sum of money.   I don't particularly care about boxing either way, I just don't see why they net so much. Maybe to pay for the gambling problems, court costs, and 24 hour care when their brains are mush.	8
1	There's some confirmation and attribution bias at play in your second example. I've worked with plenty of low performers who were white. I never once attributed their low performance with their race though.	8
1	Do you realise what you just said is incredibly rude? This person is sharing their journey not asking for your "constructive criticism". It's fucking disgusting.  I thoroughly doubt you would tell someone in person they need surgery so leave it out. Just because this is the internet doesn't mean you can't hurt the person that made the post.	8

0	That's not what I'm saying, but I don't see any studies pointing to a *causal* relationship between the centuries of oppression and current performance of women.  After all, gender isn't inherited like race - you're as likely to be a woman born to a rich educated family as you are to be a man born into that same family, unlike race where history actually can be pointed to as having tangible effects on individuals on a demographic basis.	8
0	Age doesn't matter. When i was 18 i dated a guy 9 years older than me and after him i said to never ever date an older guy. Now i'm 23 and happy with a guy 22 years older then me for almost 1,5 year.  If you love eachother you just do, if you don't you don't. It's really that simple	8

1	Humans are supposed to naturally have sex and make babys at puberty. Culture is the only thing that has truly changed that. culture is an unnatural thing to begin with because people created it. I feel like mankind has become delusional about what we really are. Animals. We need a huge increase of sex education. The sooner we stop treating sex like its the boogeyman the sooner people will stop having weird sexually repressed psychological problems.	8
0	I am a feminist, and I know what feminism is. My issue is that I suspect this story is not the whole truth, and all it is doing is propagating the myth that women want special treatment. If I believed the story was the whole truth, I would be pissed about it. I *am* pissed, just not at the story itself but the journalists I suspect put an untruthful, sensationalistic spin on it.	8
0	The mayor is right.  He said that someone alone is likely to get taken advantage of more than 2 people.  Removing genders completely from the equation it is still true.  1 man walking alone during any time of the day is more likely to be taken advantage of than 2 men walking together.  Blasting him for telling people to take precautions is crazy.	8
0	This needs more attention!	8
0	I took health and sex ed like 10 years ago in North Carolina (so definitely not the most liberal instruction) and they definitely taught us about menstrual cups. I find it hard to believe that most women get super excited about them because they didn't know they existed before...	8
0	&gt;he was trying to get my mom and sister to sleep with him  That's *fucked up* but it's not threatening or physically coercive. Again, the test is usually some fear of harm. OP is just creeped out.	8
0	more black widow less miss marvel.	8
1	I didn't think of Widow as much more than a perfect fit for her role. There when you want her, doing her own thing that furthers the story off screen. She seems to be one of the glues that hold the team together but strong enough on her own to complete SHIELD missions.  The useless one I've seen is Hawkeye, after reading the comics and watching the cartoons I felt Renners version of Hawkeye was lackluster and since i'm adhering to the AoU no spoilers rule I'll just say I was disappointed with the lack of Hawkeye heritage in both Avengers movies.	8

0	Well then I guess you only buy empirical statistics.  I wouldn't recommend applied mathematics, statistics, or any science as a field for you really.   Also: I would recommend actually looking at the source rather than making general attacks on problematic statistical methods.	8
1	Probation? He committed a crime, he should be in jail.  There should be a serious question to the ethics boards competence and independence considering they did not act. Since they clearly do not understand their mandate, perhaps they need to be replaced with a state run body.	8
0	ummm....no.  they are due to gendered differences in sexuality. when you look at foreveralones (or people who are non-voluntarily holding onto their virginity well into their 20s/30s) you will notice the vast majority of them are male.  simply put, the average male has to put in a lot more effort than the average female when it comes to having success with sex and dating. studies have shown women find the majority of men to be physically unattractive or below average, which leads to the inflation of effort needed as a man to be successful in dating.  if women and men had the same sexual strategy and needs then the problem would solve itself.	8
0	isn't there something to be said for, it just not being any of our business? we don't have a right to know everything about a public figure's private life.	8
1	I do treat women nicely to get in their pants. That's a reality. I don't know why this surprises women. I do have women friends with whom I am strictly platonic, but I have zero interest in fucking them.   Some guys are just great guys that are nice to women no matter what. Unfortunately these guys often get looked over and forgotten as far as potential romantic partners, and then people wonder why more men aren't interested in being "nice guys" when they see narcisstic assholes excelling in the romance department.	8

0	Taxation is what we pay to live in a functioning, modern country. It's not coercion. If you have no income, you're not taxed.	8
1	Yeah, same thing happened to me when I tried ignoring them - he started getting really offended and aggressive... That's why I don't try that any more	8
0	I think most guys most expensive clothes would be a suit if they have one.  And honestly, women get much much more variety and latitude in their clothing - for guys, even formal non work events require some variation of the suit if not the same suit.	8
1	I hope OP considers this. I was pretty concerned that they though they were "dumb" for asking for advice. Feeling knocked down at 15 for nearly anything can lead to bad decisions. Glad this conversation is so considerate.	8
0	Yes it's weird.  Wait 4 years and see what his interests are then. Stick him in the friend zone until then. Avoid physical contact and being alone with him at all times.   Even if you were willing and made moves on him, he can still go to prison for touching you. If you care at all about his future, don't let him ruin it.	8
1	And if they can't make the requirements, too bad. It isn't meant to be, so do something else. Same for a guy; if you can't do it, oh well. Accept it and move on.	8
1	She gets angry because she cares about you.  This is seriously worrying, please block his number, cut all contact and tell your parents at the earliest opportunity.  Anger passes, and your mother will be happy you came to her out of concern.	8
0	I don't know if he really thinks I'm attractive, I mean he flirts with everyone, even other boys. I guess he could be bi though. I know people say that a first kiss is overrated but I think every girl wants there's to be special, not something like this.	8
1	I would do this but there was an incident with another girl who didn't give him notice about quitting (unrelated) and he refused to give her her last paycheck. It's just an awful environment.	8

1	Switching to the Lunette after a year with a Diva was like coming home.   If cups work for you, I think you know it. Once I realized the Diva was a terrible cup but I knew I definitely still wanted a cup, I catalogued all of the ways (while bleeding everywhere, feeling like I had prostate problems when I peed and ruining countless panties) the Diva was failing me for a few months, then bought a replacement which seemed better suited. It was a guess, but I'm so thrilled the Lunette was just 100% an appropriate fix.	8

0	just keep it on the down low until you hit 18. I mean, you can let him hit it and stuff. just don't get caught. Once you're 18 though. you can go all out. even have a kid if you really want to. 7 years age difference isnt too big. I'm 27 and have always kept my GF's at the age of 18 - 21. no older than 21. they start to become smart and more experienced with guys like me. keep it real yo. take Da D	8

1	Even though I'm vehemently pro-choice, I kind of understand where people are coming from when they count fetuses as full human beings. I absolutely can't understand how something like an ectopic pregnancy would be anything but a no brainer to treat/terminate. Absolutely unconscionable...	8
1	Your past trauma makes me feel like this is such an unhealthy situation for you. Please talk to your therapist and make sure you are actively taking your own feelings into consideration, not only his.	8
0	I'm going to go with "yes."	8
0	A 7 year age difference is nothing.  You shouldn't listen to all of these wackos. Live your life to be happy.  The insanity here is just that: insanity.  Do you feel like a small child? No? Yeah, because you aren't a small child.  15 year olds have relationships with 23 year olds (and older) all the time. People used to marry much older, like 14 and 30 commonly.	8
0	I want to know why we punish people professionally ad inifitim for what they are punished for judicially.  That's double jeopardy.  He committed these crime, he received punishment for these crimes, his punishment for those crimes are complete.  You shouldn't be able to then punish someone *for the rest of their life* over it.  And everybody should know not to get in a relationship with him.  Anybody who does, after knowing his record, is simply naïve, ignorant, or both.	8
0	Erm nooooo.  There's about a 1000 year gap between the last crusade and women's rights. I would say it had more to do with the World Wars and technology then Koranic philosophy	8
0	Look, when I read these types of threads all I want to say is "OMG get the fuck out of that relationship as soon as possible and don't look back."  Anything less than that reaction is inappropriate... I mean c'mon.	8
1	She failed the test.  Then they changed it.  She failed the test that many other women have already passed.  She should pursue a job with physical standards she is able to meet.	8
0	Guy knew what he wanted and didn't want to waste a lot of time working towards it so he just presented it to you honestly.  The (perhaps) sad part is that so many heavier women have such low self esteem that this "pick up line" has probably worked for him in the past and result in him licking some fat chick's pussy and then fucking her in the arse (or ass, if you're American).	8
0	Age of consent is 16 in many states, assuming they're in the U.S or Canada, so his legal range is 16-infinity.  Hers is probably like 13-17.	8

1	The clinic probably has a lot of problems with fake appointments as well- protesters will fill up the appointment books and never show- which could be a reason they were mistrustful of the SO.	8
0	Lol, where that came from?? That doesn't make any sense. If anything you sound more like supporting pedophile tendencies with condoning age difference in so young relationships.  You just want to insult me now without reasons. Don't be so insecure. If you believe so much in what you believe why you feel the need to insult me? Just let it go and live your life the way you want it. It's clear we wont agree on this issue.	8
0	Here's an idea.  Why don't you link any sort of evidence that indicates when girls end puberty.  What is the age you think makes sense?  40?	8
1	&gt;I gave him a $700 spending cap because hell, that's almost two months rent around here.  As someone in DC area.... I hate you, that's not even half of one month!	8
1	Unfortunately it's a huge gamble on how this would go. I can't tell you how many times myself or my friends have been insulted/assaulted for directly saying no to man. They deserve to be publicly shamed for their shitty, aggressive behavior, but it can be an unsafe move for a woman alone to make.   I'm not being hyperbolic; women get killed over this shit. Humiliating a strange man is a good way to increase your odds of being assaulted.	8

1	I'm not agreeing that porn is bad, I'm saying that porn is neither bad or good, but more appropriate at a certain age. It's like with violence and mature themes, they aren't intrinsically bad, just designed for a different age. I'm not advocating for it to be either completely illegal or completely allowed for children, I'm just trying to say pornography isn't inherently bad, and that treating it that way is necessarily a good thing.	8

Jeezus kreist, no wonder she started working out so hard. In theory, I agree with comments above that people shouldn't not be able to work after serving time. But, I can't help but feel like "GODDAMNIT SEAN PENN, you really shouldn't be allowed to work in Hollywood and make millions of dollars and stuff if this is how you treat people!" I feel so conflicted about this.	8
1	yeah dude, im with you.   My dog tells me that I need to remember not to take money so seriously.   She does so by chewing up napkins/paper towels, etc. right in front of me whenever i'm counting money, or even stressing about it. She can tell by my energies. I would bet my life on it.	8
1	No one's denying his right to a child or a willing egg donor. If a successful woman was making this much fuss because she wants *a specific man's* sperm and he refused, she would be just as wrong / creepy.	8
1	The so called "toxicity" of feminism is overblown. Sure there are shitty people that identify as feminists, but there are shitty people that identify as anything. I think that animal rights is a good thing but I don't have to agree with PETA. A movement does not have to be defined by extreme members of the crowd. If you don't personally want to identify as so that is fine, but it is not feminism that is the problem, it is some feminists that need to be called out for hate speech.	8

1	I'm in the military and we have the same discussions about women in Ranger School and in combat arms.   I don't want women in combat arms unless they can do exactly the same job as the men. Ranger School is a little different, but standards are standards.   I am female, and I don't want to be combat arms because I would be a danger to my comrades if the shit hit the fan. But you damn well better believe you want me on that FOB behind a computer finding threats. That is how I can best contribute; with my brains, not my muscles.	8
0	yup. fuck the diva cup. i'm glad that it works ohsowell for others but my vagina hates the shit out of it. for those with vaginismus, please never try the diva cup. i don't experience high levels of pain with my vaginismys but FUCK if i could get that giant piece of rubber into my smaller-than-average vagina. do companies that makes these cups think of us women with small vaginas? even the small versions of these cups are too big. yeah, i'm sticking with tampons and pads. never touching that thing again.	8
1	THANK YOU! I'm inundated by people purporting this thing and even when I tell them about the limitations and even PAIN I get down there (can't use tampons for that reason too), they still insist "you just have to find the right cup!"  Fuck you my anatomy doesn't want a rubber cup stuffed up there, leave my vag alone.	8

1	&gt; I mean, just because the original claim was false, does that mean the mayor should be allowed to got and start advocating that women should stay in kitchens?  You would deny his freedom of speech and expression and say that he shouldnt be allowed?  Regardless though, thats not what he said and you know it. Stop trying to make it bigger than it is.	8
1	Unless he specifically for some reason has no other options for children and this medical fact has not been disclosed publicly.  This would be the only condition in which I can see his case having a snowballs chance in Bermuda.	8
0	He that is without sins cast the first stone.  Today's liberals are the intellectual descendants of the intolerant puritans.   Mayweather is no angel. I'm sure of you look down the roster of any team you will discover a lack of angels too. If you go to any restaurant and see who the cooks and staff are you might discover the lack of angels there as well. If you look at the democrat party you will see a whole list of thieves, abusers, serial philanderer and rapists,  ex KKK members etc. yet liberal feminist still are in lock step with democrats. Why do we ignore that?	8

1	Prepubescent, I'm not awarding any universal strength award to males. Additionally, the compliment on strength is rarely about how much you can lift... Furthermore, why would I avoid saying you're strong if she is strong and what is confusing about that.      and there is gender equality on a cellular level, or no equality with anyone on a cellular level, whichever you prefer. Biological sex in humans is not a linear gradient, it's not a dichotomy. It is in terms of human demes, but not in terms of the species.	8
1	It looks like the only problem you *didn't* have with it was the one where it suction cups itself in there and you have to have it removed in an ER! I saw a thread about that happening a while back...       Smug Diva Cup fans are like the Linux users of menstruating people. Just... shhhhh, not every conversation about menstrual products can end with "DIVA CUP, FIXED IT FOR YOU". It's nice you've found something that works for you, it really is, just don't expect it to be the perfect solution for everyone with a vagina.  Edit: WHAT. Babby's first reddit gold!	8

1	I admittedly was zoning out during that period of the movie. She really WAS a monster, she was an assassin who killed a lot of innocent people. The dream reminded her of the monster she was. I thought she mentioned the sterilization so Bruce would know upfront they would never be able to have a family together, like the one Hawkeye had. But again, I was zoning.	8
1	I only use o.b. tampons, to be honest, and think they're the best. I get the ones called "pro comfort" (in my country) with what they call a silk touch surface, which is actually just mesh stuff that makes them a bit easier to insert (the original ones are too dry/cottony for me). One time a friend gave me some no-name brand tampon and it was like sticking a styrofoam shank up my cooch, not that I'd know what that actually feels like.	8

1	This is a very complex question, I think it is legitimate for experienced professionals to help the parents on the matter.   I'd rather see children have a neutral, facts-based sex ed, than whatever politically or religiously oriented bullshit (or absence thereof) their parents can make up/be taught to tell the children by some obscure authority.   Another effect can be indirect sex ed of the parents by their children when the parents themselves have been victim of such bullshit.	8

1	Same.  Highschool was a nightmare because I couldn't go more than an hour or two without changing my tampon even with a pad, and trying to do that in the 5 minutes they allow you in between classes meant I could be comfortable but late to class, or not go to the bathroom and risk leaking everywhere during the next class.  I'm so glad I have a job now where I can go to the bathroom as often as I need to.	8

1	I work for one of the companies that produces a popular smartphone OS, and people are *constantly* asking me to explain why one is superior over the other. Without fail, I have to explain that some people prefer different aspects over others, so I can't magically deduce what OS will work better for them. I have my own preference, and it's not one-size-fits-all.  Just like the Diva Cup, which works perfectly for me! OP's testimony is hilarious and spot-on, but I have a light enough flow that I only have to empty it every other day. Can't beat that convenience! (Plus I'm paranoid about TSS.)	8

I quietly asked my friend to hand me the tissue box and I used them to clean the chair.. as I prepared to leave at the end of class, I told my teacher that I had wiped boogers on the chair and it should probably be cleaned.  ...in retrospect, that was way weirder than telling her I had my period.

If this were some random on facebook or twitter, I would agree with you. That is not the case here.  Additionally, as many people have said here, the school might have permission to post work.	8

1	&gt;He may actually like you,  I'm sorry, but it doesn't matter in the slightest if he actually likes her or not.  The only things that matter in this situation is the ages.  15+23, under any circumstances, is not ok.  She needs to nope right out of this.	8
0	No, I'm not on birth control and I definitely going to look into it ASAP. My BMI is under 25 so I'm sure that won't affect it but I'm just worried about the effectiveness. I really do not want to become pregnant for a couple more years. Thanks for the info.	8
0	Right? His face looks more like WOOOO!	8
1	I believe that a baby should never be a consequence, no matter what situation it was conceived from.  Rape, birth control malfunction, stupidity etc  I honestly don't understand the double murder charges people get for killing a pregnant woman before the third trimester though. You'd think if we can say its not a person before a certain time, why would we charge a second murder conviction to something that isnt considered a person?  Anyway, if someone wants to explain that to me, that'd be great.	8

1	The conclusions are biased and incorrect though. It suggests that women carry more of a burden mentally because of their "biology", which is not only incorrect (men suffer mental issues at high rates as well, but they tend to manifest and/or be diagnosed differently) but neglects very real societal causes for women's mental illness.	8

Learning to control yourself, and your fears, and overcome your shyness might help you. It isn't easy but it can be done. Men will still hit on you, but you'll be more comfortable with yourself, and better prepared to deal with the situation.	8

0	Asking for a um "friend".	8
0	I think you feel betrayed because of your own past, and also because you will question why he feels sexually attracted towards young girls when he has you. But a person's sexual appetite comes in many different flavours, and, in many cases, disgusting forms.  None can be helped.  Only controlled or carried out on a willing partner.   For example, i might really enjoy strangling a girl during sex, or beating them, but would never carry this out because im not an arsehole and love my partner.  But i still have these urges, this need.  Does this make me a monster?	8
0	The general opinion is that men "should know better" and "should have wrapped it up" and "better step up and accept responsibility for their actions". So I think it's safe to say that pregnancy is a punishment for men having sex... Unless they manage to dip out and find employment without using their SSN.	8

0	We do that, but unfortunately a few slip through the cracks, and the government can't really protect you from them until they actually commit a crime. That's just the nature of our criminal justice system.	8
1	Probably because TwoX/Jezebel type feminists are so venomous to anyone who doesn't identify how they want them to. It's hard for a young woman to break away from that kind of hate.	8
0	sorry, need to be pedantic here but paedophilia does not require you to act on it. Purely being attracted to children is paedophilia - attraction to children. What you're thinking of is a child molester.	8
1	Well, why though?  Falling behind is falling behind.  Something is causing it, and should be counteracted, same as things hurting other groups.  Look at Jews, who are kind of in the reverse spot.  Hundreds of years of domination/oppression, and now doing quite well in the US.   Which should determine if they get affirmative action or other benefits - the hundreds of years, or how they're doing now?  I don't think we need pro-Jewish affirmative action currently, because the current situation is what's important.	8

One is in jail with a sex offender record and the other now has a lazy eye because her dad didn't appreciate catching him in bed with his daughter. This is wrong. Tell someone you trust, block his number and find yourself someone your own age. Maturity is attractive but he's trying to take advantage. Run!	8

0	Many men sure can't be trusted in controlling their sexual urges, but it surely doesn't apply to all of them.  Not wanting to change his desire is rather healthy because if he wanted to it would only end in disappointment and self-hate. Getting emotional support and learning to "admire from afar and not touch" is probably the best he can get.	8

1	Seriously, the Chicago Fire Department just had their test this past winter and over 30,000 people showed up. About 17,000 passed it (myself included) and only about 2,000 will get called from it in the next 6-10 YEARS. AND if you passed the test, you're put into a lottery and that's how the list is compiled. Number 1 might have gotten a 75% while number 14,353 might have gotten an 99%, but they get the shaft because of the lottery.  Chicago's Finest my ass...

I tried it two years ago and I'm never going back, it's the simplest thing. I've had no problems even changing it at work. I used to always forget to buy new pads/tampons and it's nice to just not need to stress.	8

1	Porn has almost never if ever ruined a marriage. Now I'm aware there are very rare individuals that have addiction to porn to the point that it effects their lives in a real way but it's so rare I've never heard of it outside of a few vague articles and studies. If porn ends your marriage because you're that controlling of your partner that they can't look at other men/women then that's your personal problem. The only time I could see porn as problematic is if it's used to replace intimacy with your partner. Otherwise it's completely victimless and normal.	8

1	Seriously. I mean it's brought up even on his PPV fights with something like "He's been facing a lot of adversity with his legal troubles."   It's very funny how the American media picks and chooses who to go after for identical crimes, particularly the taboo ones of DUI and domestic abuse.	8
1	&gt;I just don't think he realizes it's innappropiate?  He's 23, he most certainly does.  Look, it would be one thing if he had an awkward, little crush on you, and did absolutely nothing about it because holy moly inappropriate, but awkward, little crushes happen.	8

0	you don't know a damn thing about feminism if you don't think this backlash has been going on for decades	8
0	I agree.  edit: my comment above just meant that comparing being promiscuous to committing crimes isn't fair because one is unlawful and one isn't. But both are still in the past and irrelevant and shouldn't be used as victim blaming.	8
0	I know it's bad to lead these types of people on, but here's what I would comment:  I can just picture this going through your mind: "That girl is wearing a mini skirt... ugh.. dammit, now I have to rape her."	8
1	Because we all know that makeup defies age and weight in a way comparable to posting pictures of a model half your age.	8
0	What if a 16 year old creep at a party hit on her?  That's cool with you right?	8
0	I was romantically involved with a 15 year old girl when I was 23. I don't think it's weird at all that he's interested in you. You don't have to be a creep or pedo to fall in love with someone who is years younger than you. If you were 75 and he was 83, nobody would give a crap about the age difference.	8
0	He's going to do what he wants to do.  Accept him for who he is.  Guys are still going to want to look at other women.  As long as he's not cheating, I wouldn't worry about it.	8
0	So I guess that takes us back to my original questions to you that you never answered.  &gt; Where do you draw the line? Does wearing makeup distort who you objectively are? What if a guy claims to airline pilot, but he's really just a flight attendant? What if he's a co-pilot? What if he has all the credentials to be a pilot, but just has to put in his flight hours?	8
0	That same sentiment goes both ways though.  Women have the right to do whatever they want with their bodies, however, that doesn't mean they have control over what men find attractive.  That's saying I like my body this way and you have to like it too.  If I got a face tattoo, no one would have any right to tell me I can't do that.  However, they do have the right to choose not to associate with me.	8
0	I think it holds because it brings the victim's past into a situation where it is irrelevant in order to excuse a violent crime.  But yes, breaking the law is a crime whereas being promiscuous is not (though some would like to believe it is).	8
1	When my little cousin (15 going 16f) started dating this 22 yr old guy from their church, only the younger generations were grossed out by the age gap. It was weird to us, but to the older relatives it was OK and to her parents, it was more than OK since.. they can't date outside their church.	8
1	You'd think so, wouldn't you. But all these women were sharing stories of how they can't go into malls anymore because of Victoria Secret, and how they'd go up to grocery store managers and demand they cover up magazines. I just don't get it.	8
0	for instance like if they would go after an entire town for trying to sweep rape under the rug and protect football players?? too bad we don't live in that world.	8
1	No, he's right.  Teen pregnancy rates amongst 20 year olds is shockingly low.	8
0	Never, once you realize that life is a lot easier. It isn't clear that prevents people from taking a stand, more often it's just apathy.  Marvel at how far we've come technologically but realize that we are still on, primitive animals and always will be.  We form our little tribes and outside of them no one really matters very much. And most people are fucked up enough to hurt people in their own group.  It's naïve to think this will ever change humanity will always be violent and greedy and mentally ill.	8
1	I'm so sorry. This is insane. Humans are sexual creatures and research about bloodflow in ladyparts has actually shown women to be more diverse in our erotic visual appreciation of others.   Perhaps that's part of the problem here -- A woman who has been convinced she can't love herself hates seeing other women loving themselves.   I see Victoria's Secret models and think they're surely smart, artistic women who probably like things I enjoy, and I hope they have awesome lives.	8
1	Don't get me wrong, I'm a plastic applicator gal but have you ever pinched yourself in one? Holy hell it's terrible.	8
1	Sounds like you have an experience which should be brought to counseling. You aren't less of a man for seeking professional help to find healing for a difficult experience as a child. Men don't run from doing what's right.  I say healing because the memory you describe as having caused your present fears. Check with a professional.  Your campus should have a counselor who can refer you privately. No one has to know you're meeting with one unless you want them to.	8
1	This is feminism at its worst. People could die if she can't perform her job.	8
0	I feel like even though it may be talked about a lot, he's hardly "paid" for it the way other sports celebrities do. Like the article said, Ray Rice was dropped from his team and faced a suspension, and Adrian Peterson was also suspended. While I'm not familiar with whatever professional association regulates boxing, why has he faced no accountability for his actions within the boxing sphere?	8
0	I mean there's definitely some issues with this approach but I can actually see emotional attachment and psychological reasons to want the embryos he created prior. As the devil's advocate it is more intimate to have a child you shared with someone rather than were leased, if you can consider donor eggs as such.	8
1	It doesn't matter if he gave off rapey vibes. He's trying to take advantage of you. You seem smart, which is fantastic in this situation but this guy is a pervert and deserves nothing more than an ass kicking by a father figure in your life.	8
0	I wanted it to be a little more special then some jerk I didn't even like stole my first kiss from me in a school library. A first kiss is something you will remember and I don't want this to be my memory of it. I don't think anyone wants any kiss like that.	8
0	It was not a professional thing for her to say. Perhaps she had a patient before you  that drained her emotionally.	8
1	Pretty much any person who has the confidence to write or create has some ego. I'm sure bell hooks is up her own ass to some degree! When you do big things and get lots of positive attention, you're gonna have some kind of ego. I'm not worried about him personally. I'm worried about the people who go in on their own so hard they annoy them off social media. Not the Josses, but all of the anonymous people we don't recognize who left.	8
1	I knoooow, it's like the new abrathatfits. The DivaCup is the second coming of Christ - I'm sure someone will, at some point, bless it in some weird Burning Man ceremony and drink their menstrual blood out of it. Or at least wine, in some sort of performance art.	8
1	I believe that if people could get help for this they would be less likely to offend. But if multiple people suspected this, then he's not handling it as well as he thinks he is.	8
0	So would you say the same thing about a successful woman wanting sperm to have a child without a man or partner involved?? Because maybe a big reason he was with this woman was to have children, obviously it was important enough that he had embryos frozen.  It seems reasonable enough to me that he sincerely wants the child.	8
0	The way Lennon treated his son for sure was a disgrace. Look at Walt Disney, he was a raging anti Semite but he died relatively young and in the 1960's before it was socially unacceptable.  That's what I love about guys like Frank Sinatra and Dean Smith they were way ahead of their time when it came to civil rights. They were known for treating people with respect no matter the color of their skin.	8
1	I have nothing informative to offer,  I just want to tell you that you sound like a caring friend and I think that it's important to let your friend feel how much you care.  You can help her by loving her.  I hope that she can begin to feel better. It's a scary thing, our minds, especially with pregnancy hormones involved.  Be there for her.  You're a good friend.	8

1	The exact same thing happened to a friend of mine... she was 20 weeks by the time she was able to actually get it done, even though she literally started the process the moment she missed her period. It is disgusting to force a woman through that amount of stress and unnecessary hardship.	8
1	More directed at OP and younger/unsure girls in general but *always* listen to your gut and walk away when you have a weird feeling about going somewhere with or doing something for someone who has sexual/romantic intentions. In my experience, it's right 99% of the time.	8

1	I'm trans MtF, going on 8 years on hormones.  Pills - regulated.  Injections - rollercoaster.  The biggest difference is sex drive, testosterone is the reason porn is big money.  The second biggest difference is the ability to read the intentions of others, estrogen is a bullshit detector.  The third biggest difference, food cravings.  Damn I want a kit-kat right now. You're welcome.	8
1	There are funds available to help women pay for abortions in certain circumstances:  http://www.fundabortionnow.org/get-help/financial-counseling  There may also be resources to help with transportation and lodging.  The 24 hr waiting period is a huge problem there.  The closest state you could go to without a waiting period is Tennessee.	8
0	The fucked up reality is this : the city, the authority, can never guarantee your safety from a random event. Do you think there should be patrolmen stationed at every dark corner or that every person should be provided an armed escort when they're out on the town?  It's not realistically possible.    For most people the illusion of security is enough to keep things in line, but really it is just an illusion. Most people don't constantly worry about being attacked on the street, because statistically it's still a very low chance to happen	8

1	It's hard to even find applicators in Australia. They're not been a thing, like ever. When I was in South East Asia it took me forever to find a place that sold tampons and they only had the applicator ones. They, to me as a woman who had been menstruating for over fifteen years and primarily using tampons in that time, were difficult to insert and painful. They pinched and it was hard to tell when they were properly inserted since I'm used to using my fingers to position them.	8
0	Yeah.  And she didn't ask for that.  I don't know how to account for allocations of blame- but she didn't unequivocally say no, and didn't stop her mom from saying yes.	8

0	That would be an excellent point if she somehow snuck onto the scene. The same people that vetted those other 4 though approved of her. She is their 5th qualified fire fighter. The 3rd situation (which closely mirrors this) is that you have 4 nurses that all passed and perform. I don't know how TwoX became experts on fire fighter qualifications in face of the group that has approved every other of the 11,000+ force.	8
1	This is amazing.  The gun part at the end.  Too good.	8
0	What is the difference?	8
0	Yeah, forgetting to buy the plan B was pretty irresponsible of him, but forgetting something one time is normal. Given, it's obviously a pretty big fuck-up on his end, I don't know how you forget something that important you know, but idk. If he has fallen through numerous times in the past, you might need to worry. If it's just the one instance with the plan B? Let this situation be his last chance.	8
1	I agree. I don't believe that he can be faulted for having such desires (after all, you don't get to choose your sexuality) but his unwillingness to seek help for it is a red flag for me. If you have pedophilic tendencies you represent a danger to other people, no matter how well you think you have it "under control".	8

0	To be fair, I'm a "bleeder" as well - I use the large ladycup for the heaviest days and the small size towards the end. Ladycups are soft and squishy enough that both sizes are still comfy to insert/remove and use. Didnt have the same luck with the Divacup, which was ridiculously stiff and stabbed me all day long, and insanely impossible to fold and remove or insert without a fight. Removing the diva resulted in some serious carrie-style blood spill...	8
1	With 50 pounds (at least) of gear, getting a 55 pound child out of a burning building is hard for her. Also, if you read the article: &gt;Despite **many attempts** over the Fire Academy’s 18-week training course, Wax completed the test **just once** — but it took her more than 22 minutes, the source said. In numerous tries, Wax struggled and was too slow. While fit probies finish with air left in their tanks, **she had to stop when hers ran out**, the source added.  Conjecture aside, no, she's proven she cannot do that job consistently, which is *literally life threatening.*	8

When I was 15 there was a guy that I initially liked and he was 23 as well...to make it more creepy after 2 weeks he told me he "loved me." When I found out his real age I left him alone, especially when he couldn't give an answer as to why he didn't want women his age....seems very pedophilly to me	8
1	From a Guy's perspective, any girl younger than half your age plus 7 is likely in appropriate.  Someone is taking advantage of someone.  So a 24 year old shouldn't date anyone younger than 19.	8
0	&gt; they don't want to have sex with whoever I objectively am   Where do you draw the line?  Does wearing makeup distort who you objectively are?  What if a guy claims to airline pilot, but he's really just a flight attendant?  What if he's a co-pilot?  What if he has all the credentials to be a pilot, but just has to put in his flight hours?	8
0	What did "going after" entail?	8
0	Lol, we had only one single, teen mom ever and she wasn't even from that group... I guess they actually were mature enough to *not* become single, teen moms. That's not nothing!!	8
0	Nice for assuming stuff about me.  Also you should really read up on health because you clearly know NOTHING of health issues or disabilities if you honestly believe they can't contribute.   And even if they didn't, it's really fucked up to assume that bigger people don't have the right to feel good about themselves.  Anyway, I'm done with this idiotic conversation. Have fun trolling other people's posts.	8
1	Have you seen the new Daredevil series on netflix? It's entirely focused on the "street-level" super hero idea. Each one of the Defenders ( the street level version of the Avengers) is getting their own series ( Daredevil, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and Jessica Jones)  It's extremely gritty and has a very similar feel to Dredd in the sense of small scale.  [Here is a great fight scene that shows how you feel the fight could go either way.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B66feInucFY)	8
1	I think when she said "You could get in big trouble" and he said "it would be worth it", they're both pretty clearly referring to statutory rape, which would be the only obviously illegal "ie, "trouble" part of this scenario.	8
1	Me too! I only just read the Beka Cooper series last year, though, [when Mark Reads was doing that series](http://markreads.net/reviews/2014/02/mark-reads-terrier-part-1/). He's moved on to The Circle books now, and is generally a delightful human being who shares his enthusiasm with experiencing new things (like Tamora Pierce books) with the world.	8

1	She needs to GTFO. ASAP. Her home life is only going to *keep* pushing her towards suicide, and until she leaves, she's going to be at extremely high-risk.      Put simply: **HER FAMILY IS ABUSIVE**.       She needs to go to a shelter, or something. Now. Yesterday. Last week. She won't start improving until she's out of there.	8

1	They may be *trying* to be politically correct by hiring more women, but it's not *actually* politically correct to say that women firefighters cannot be expected to be as capable as men.	8
0	fair point, that seems fine, as long as she's not making any false accusations. judging by the intent of the thread in general she could definitely give a wildly exaggerated take on what's going on!	8
1	I was dating a 17 year old while I was 21. It felt a little odd, but the attraction was purely based on who she was. Not her age. I think age really doesn't have to play a huge role, but 23 and 15 is really stretching it.	8
1	That fact wasn't fun at all	8
0	You go to jail you are likely to lose your job, and future job opportunities become harder to get. I blame the boxing association, though, and not him, for allowing him to fight still.	8
0	&gt; But that doesn't mean you can swing the pendulum the other way and pretend it didn't happen.  Quote me saying it didn't happen. Go ahead, I'll wait. Must be hard defeating that strawman huh? Tough to win at arguments when you base their side on things never said.   And it wouldn't be the first time racist fuckers in the FBI made something up to get someone in trouble. I mean, they were wiretapping him for what reason now? lol. As if a voice recording with multiple people in the room is confirmation of anything.	8
1	This description reads a lot like a synopsis of Fifty Shades... that's worrying.	8
1	Fucking *this*.  Drives me up a wall when people blame this stuff on "political correctness" or "SJW" or whatever.  This is *the exact opposite of political correctness.*    A "PC" statement:  "Women can be just as strong as men, and should be required to meet all the same standards as men."  A sexist statement: "Women are weak, so we only really expect them to do half of what a man could do."	8
1	I have nothing significant to add, but could you give us an update if you contact the school and get a response? I'm pissed off on your behalf and I need to know how this turns out!   Anyway, best of luck. I believe Dr. Seuss and Roald Dahl did mildly non-kid-friendly stuff, and it obviously didn't damage their careers irreparably.	8
0	I saw some male strippers once, it was awkward and unpleasant.	8
1	While I appreciate the message they're trying to send, is that legal?  Here, it would be considered gender discrimination, and would quickly result in them either being shut down, or, at the very least, them having to pay a compensatory fine to whomever made the complaint.	8
0	There are definitely a lot of parents that fit that bill, but I think that subreddit shows the danger of assuming parents are being manipulative.  A lot of those stories are parents being human and children reacting irrationally.  Then everyone tells the kids, "Good job!  Show 'em!"  A lot of it just breeds an unhealthy heart.  Here, I think she should tell her parents.  Even if the event is pretty traumatic, it might show both the daughter and the mother that they can trust each other even while the mother retains her role as the parent.  That could be huge.	8
1	No, it REALLY wouldn't. There *is* no way to make it 100% equal, because men do not physically have to go through carrying a child.   All this would do would be to give men leverage to try and force women to abort (*if you want this kid that we both accidentally made, fine! but you're raising it on your own, with no support from me!*).   And if she did still carry to term, it would greatly decrease the child's quality of life due to lower socioeconomic status.	8
0	I'm 43 and my GF is 30. Seems okay now. If she were 15 and I was 28, that would be creepy. I know that societal norms have changed while evolution has not necessarily changed as well. But, societal norms have still changed...	8
0	The child is also a patient so it's not that clear cut.	8
1	Beautiful stone but probably not advisable.. This scale is the hardness rating for gemstones and Opals are faaarrr from durable.

0	Funny how age differences work out sometimes.  I married a woman six years younger- she was 23 at the time.  Nobody thought it was strange at all.  But turn the clock back just a little, and I am a pervert!  In your instance, unless you feel he is "the one" you should move on.  His attraction to you is, in my opinion, probably quite normal.  But it is also illegal to act on in a sexual way.  In a few short years (in the scheme of things) all will be fine.  But right now he qualifies as a pedophile (but at least in a good way!)	8
1	Screenshot it, right now. It has your personal info, that's some jailtime or at least a huge fine. Take that bitch to court.	8
1	Don't we tell boys the same thing about girls?	8
0	I'm trying but its so hard to sit back and do nothing again. i understand her wanting to drop it but i have seen how much it hurts her.  Thank you btw for taking time to help me	8
1	I'm not the one defending a rapist here.   And here you are raising your own word choice "gotcha" on me, so you can go after me for criticizing someone's trivialization of rape. Well, if that's what you want to do.	8
0	Have you seen a therapist about your past or current concerns?  It sounds like you've gone through some heavy stuff and I think self-destructive behavior is probably pretty common given the circumstances.	8
1	I've never been so happy to have a penis. Seriously, you women have it rough.	8
1	I live in North Carolina, and the only sex education classes we had were abstinence only.	8
1	I didn't mean that they were identical but they fulfil a similar role in a team. I would draw parallels between spy and detective. Batman does have more brute strength and gadgets but he can't take down giant aliens like Supes or Green Lantern can. He works best from the shadows, manipulating people's fear and putting a lot of his time into research and development of tools and techniques. I didn't so much mean to compare the last part to Bats, though I still think he's better at doing more than punching information out of people than most of the rest of the Justice League.	8

0	I'd say it's wrong without consent. Idk if I'd say it's creepy.	8
1	Yeah using abortion as birth control is insane. You have to commit to at least 3 appointments for it (consultation, procedure, follow up), pay for it, and go through the pain of the procedure and recovery. I can't think of any reason why someone would use abortion as birth control.	8
1	I jus had an abortion in new orleans at a clinic 3 weeks ago. Id be happy to give you their information. The sweetest people on the planet work there. Wonderful place!!!	8
1	I'm sorry that all of this is going on at the same time for you. I've been there feel free to PM me. I...this is rough. And the universe is through a lot of shit in your plate at once. You're stronger than you know though so whatever happens you can get through it.   You're not your mother. Your fiance isn't your dad. You're you and he's himself. And you have each other right now.	8
1	He just sounds insecure, to be honest. Nothing ridiculous in what you did.	8
1	I am just a plain old 25 year old guy.   I have a strong bias for reason and science.   I have read your story and I strongly respect your outlook and opinions regarding not being ready and the negative consequences that could happen from having a baby at the wrong time and I can't believe that a modern, first world country could you leave you in such a situation because of such archaic and stupid reasons!   I just wanted to write this message to let you know you have my sympathy and I wish you the best of luck and that you get what you need.	8
1	I was 14, shy and embarrassed. and definitely not the strong headed 23 year old I am now. I do hold grudges though....	8
0	Oh, well, if you say so, then I guess actual history doesn't matter...	8
1	20 m here, I have concluded that people generally fear accountability. The speaker was removing the accountability from her son by justifying that Satan had overcome his body, and her son was therefore no longer accountable for his own addiction to pornography.	8
0	So he shouldn't be allowed to work anymore?      The money has nothing to do with his domestic assault. He would've gotten that money regardless because he's the best boxer in the world.	8
0	I'm sorry, when a user says that is is tired of a 2X and that we should close it down (ok ok, he didn't use those polite terms), I think the nice option is to tell him to unsubscribe. Would you have a better option? I was sure that I was being helpful to the user in question.	8
1	I can tell you now that she will not be accepted in whatever firehouse she gets assigned to. Firefighters want someone they know can do the physical tasks with them in a fire.	8
1	My pleasure, it's great two random strangers can make each other smile after a rough day. Stay awesome!	8
1	Also, you're quitting your job and if you have any sick time or vacation time, just take some of it. No one at your work needs to know why you're out and if they press and are being nosy, make something up. I would also do what other posters say and go out to lunch or take a break in your car. The situation is pretty messed up, and I really hope everything works out okay for you.	8
0	People care, because they like to be upset and fight over silly stuff. It's the rush. What ever ,is the right attitude to have.	8
1	Yeah Sean Penn and Terrence Howard annoy me the most... They still get work and you never hear anyone talk about boycotting their stuff. Such a weird double standard.	8
1	Is there any possible way you could make it to New Jersey for a little while?  You could stay with me and my family while you're going though your appointments and procedure.  I'm a 40 year old woman, married for 15 years with 2 boys and if I weren't flat broke I'd pay for your trip up here.  PM me if you're interested.  I will even drive you and be your support if you need.  Just let me know.  Shit like this pisses me off so bad and makes me feel like we're living under Sharia law.	8
1	What should be done besides the jail time he's served? Also, I hope he gets his ass beat tonight	8
1	I am so confused by this.	8
0	To him, these embryos already exist, they're already his kids. He has an emotional attachment to them and wants to give these specific children life.  I'm not saying I agree with the mindset but I don't think it's "creepy". In fact I'd say it's a very common mindset, especially from those who skew pro-life.	8
0	It's not the point.  You military?  Because I am.	8
1	Gonna be honest... I know it's a parody and I'd prefer a legit movie...  But I would watch the shit out of this if they keep the SNL cast and obvious satire.  I'd need some drinks, but I think I could enjoy it.	8
1	&gt; Then there's the guy who told me to stop being a fucking bitch and fuck him already.  Hey, just a bit of advice. You are not responsible for other people's hearts or boners. You're not beholden to anyone, ever. You can be committed to someone, but that's not servitude... you always have authority over yourself.  If any guy has a hardon for you, it's not your problem. He's got two hands; tell him to use them.  Edit: Sorry, I'm sure you knew this already but I felt the need to give a rebuttal to that asshole's message.	8
0	7 years is not much difference and by 15 I'm sure you know whats up sexually unless you are some kind of religious nut. Really comes down to how you feel about him. I would not go blabbing about it because you might get him arrested but I have known lots of couples that started when the girls was your age and the guy was much older...that siad he probably just wants to sleep with you a few times...or you may be the hottest thing around so he may stick around. the age difference is pretty common though. then again this was my generation...your mileage may very https://youtu.be/8yu7tGN9NCc?t=152	8
1	Your examples about Gray aren't similarities between his case and victim blaming. They *are* victim blaming.	8
0	This comes across somewhat as a 'fake geek girl' argument. What a person takes from a piece of media doesn't have to be what was intended by the creators - in fact, that's a whole branch of film/book criticism.	8
0	so you are telling me , if that guy was fat and ugly.. you would think that is normal... ?	8
0	Not really. It doesn't mean all 22 make more than the men. Because there are only 22 it could easily mean one or two make vastly more and the rest make less.	8
0	What source? I never claimed anything *happened*. Men failed the test all the time, and so did women. Do you have any expertise on whether the requirements were a good benchmark for determining qualified firefighters? Because I sure don't. Requirements and rules change all the time by experts in charge to better reflect what they're are looking for.  If the requirements were changed to pass a man, there would be no story.	8
1	But reddit told me nice guys aren't really nice, they're just being manipulative to get in my pants.	8

1	You'd think so. I'm firmly sticking with pads. I'm too paranoid about leaking everywhere to trust tampons, and with vestibulitis, they're often painful to use.	8
0	I never suggested you "call her on it."  I suggested you call her on the phone.  You lose tone via text and I wouldn't be willing to end a 10 year friendship over text- I would push for a conversation in person or on the phone.  I find it so strange that you're so eager to write this girl off as crazy.  I've ended friendships with no regrets, but in a case like this I would have a serious discussion.	8
1	Firstly I'm really sorry that you are going through this, and also for your loss of your Mom.   I don't have much advice for you, but I think your parents probably didn't tell you because they wanted to protect you from knowing. And they probably did that because they love you.   Do you still have the paper? One way that you might be able to open the conversation about it with your Dad would be to tell him you found something and show it to him.	8

1	**T** **E** **A** **R** **S**  Holy shit this was the funniest thing I have read all year. Thank you, lady. If you aren't already a writer for a living - you should really consider it. And if you are writing for a living - where can I subscribe?	8
1	This is hilarious.  A woman expressed her opinion, and since it isn't like yours, you tell her to start thinking "from a woman's point of view."  Women do not share a hivemind.	8

0	And you're suggesting he go to a straight conversion therapy for pedophiles/pedosexuals? I thought this is 2015.	8
0	So then do you even know what the guy was charged with? If anything. Did the cops call it a rape, etc. Or did they arrest the guy for public drunkenness or indecent exposure. BY your account seems pretty clear but by police actions not so much.	8
0	No kidding!!!	8
1	It's a problem because, half the time, people make the distinction only to normalize and de-stigmatize pedophilic behavior, subconsciously or otherwise. *That's* why it's fucked, and especially fucked that Reddit (front page of the pedo-sympathizing Internet) has such a fixation with pointing out the difference.	8
1	I totally agree with this viewpoint, however it is so complicated in America because of our history. That black culture is indeed a real and distinct entity here makes it important to recognize and not ignore, and it gets tricky trying to go above race and be "colorblind" as a society because of our tangled cultural past.	8
1	Ahahaha if people are going to be that extreme, *just imagine the world they live in* and be glad it's not yours.	8
1	Yeah, I had a copper IUD that slipped. I'm glad you're "okay" with the situation and it's working out well despite the mishap.   Thanks for the PSA, I feel like IUDs are untrustworthy based on the fact that it's SO HARD to know when they've failed; if you don't take a pill or a condom rips, you at least know Plan B is an option.	8
1	A country is probably not going to expatriate someone oversees is what /u/Sandal24 is trying to say.  I have no clue what the actual probability is.  It is probably dependent on the countries involved.	8
0	Yup. I'm aware of that 5-HTT mutation. And you're right. And that's also where the social, psychological stuff comes in. And not every woman gets postpartum. I agree with everything you said. Personally, I do subscribe to depression as a disease of civilization. I'm not convinced postpartum depression/psychosis, however, fits that description because having a mutation in one of your like 5 5-HTT receptor types, I believe, is not as "casually powerful" an explanation for depression as the failure of hormonal rebalance is to postpartum. But that's just an opinion.	8
0	They are testing you to see if the can get away with things because they are women.	8
1	This would be great if it were feasible. Unfortunately for a lot of women the one clinic in town might be the only clinic within her geographic area	8
1	I agree, if you aren't qualified, find something else to do.	8
1	Periods aren't taxed. Products are. Get a menstrual cup or reusable pads and stop complaining	8
1	My grandmother almost died from her first pregnancy due to it being ectopic. She was advised to get an abortion by her doctor but her pastor told her not too and that "miracles happen" and that if she was to die then "that's god's plan." I think there was also pressure that she wouldn't be welcomed back in the church if she terminate the pregnancy. She ended up having a really horrible miscarriage and survived, thankfully	8
1	Didn't he do jail time for it?  He had 4 fights since then, why are people bringing it up now?  People that watched the last 4 will watch this one and it will do record breaking numbers.  He has 1 more fight left after this and he will retire.  People have done worse things than he has and people don't keep bringing up there past (kill people). Manny and Tyson did some bad things in their past and changed,  so I think he should a least be given a opportunity to do the same. If he ever did something like that again a judge would throw the book at him.	8
0	When I was 15, my boyfriend was 29 and we are going to marry next year =)   In Germany this relationship is totally legal because it seems that 15yo are mature enough to decide if this relationship is good for you. I would listen to your heart. It's pretty normal that guys in his age can fall in love with 15yo.	8
0	This has been a very fascinating insight into the mind of the muslim men that think this way...	8
1	&gt;How is this any different than the times in the U.S. that girls are sent home for "inappropriate" clothing? A long skirt? Really?  I'm not sure what you're driving at, exactly.  This is entirely a religious expression issue.  They're deeming the clothing inappropriate because it's a reflection of muslim values, they're choosing to view it as essentially the same as a headscarf.  I think it's ridiculous and completely unacceptable in a free society, but completely separate from girls (or boys, for that matter) in the states being sent home for inappropriate clothing in school.	8
1	Congrats! You have to wear a Princess Leia outfit now I'm afraid.	8
0	No seriously. When did she say he ever made sexual advances towards her? You guys seem to be jumping the gun talking about a 23 year old kid who may be lonely. Jesus Christ. The way people are talking about him make it seem like he's 50 years old. Grooming her? Come on. You guys need to lay off the LMN.	8
1	The same thing happened to me. I retained a ton of water, gained 55 lbs, and bled almost constantly. I only had 3 rounds, so all this happened in 9 months.	8
0	This is almost hilarious that everyone thinks that he is a raping , abusing , manipulating pedofile who only wants to dominate her and isnt one bit truly intrested. But i have a question. What if he is not? What if he realy likes you? What if he just made a bad call telling he likes her? If the feeling to share his life with someone special?   Im not saying he is BUT what IF. What he coud have done if he realy loved?	8
1	Might be time to be blunt. Sidestepping it isn't going to help. I'm one to tell these kind of people to fuck off, but even just saying her behavior isn't acceptable and you don't want to be around her or talk to her when she is like that and say exactly what the behavior is.  Being a bride isn't an excuse for being an asshole to people and honestly from what you said this was a problem before she was a bride.	8
0	I was 60 when I had a 19 yo gf. Say what you want, but we both enjoyed each other for almost 2 years. When I was young I really liked older women and they liked me. I think age restrictions are very hypocritical.	8
1	People DO want a headlining woman in a superhero road. Studios aren't convinced it would work cause "girls".	8
0	Men and women are complementary. Men are not equal to men, women are not equal to women, and men and women are not equal to each other.	8
1	Exactly. if the mayor wants more women firefighters he should add a remedial class for those who are having trouble with the physical part. The remedial class would be nothing but some hardcore exercises and tons of diet control.	8
1	This is something my mom made me aware of when I was a teen. We had this conversation.  An additional complex that occurs when we default to calling young girls pretty is that when they're ~13 those compliments stop flowing in. People feel weird (with good reason) telling a preteen how beautiful they are. But if that's been their entire basis for their self-worth, they're going to keep seeking attention for physical merits. They're going to be beset with self-doubt when the only thing they've been conditioned to care about stops "mattering" to other people.	8
0	I find it hilarious that the poster was very careful to avoid giving the teacher in this post a gender, and yet most of the posts here are assuming the teacher was male. Sexism much?    Also, knee-jerk stuff like this is why I decided not to be a teacher.	8
0	Ahh, that's brilliant! That hadn't even occurred to me...	8
1	Seems to me that the only ones not taking rape seriously are the feminists in this thread who think that Schumer did nothing wrong by raping a nearly-unconscious drunk man. Not to mention the fact that she made fun of his poor sexual performance after taking advantage of him.	8
1	Oh look! My penis accidentally fell out by accident.	8
0	Agreed. Although I have had sex with my MeLuna, which is like a divacup. Probs wasn't supposed to, but I did.	8
0	theres nothing wrong with liking a younger, and even pre-legal person. however there is everything wrong in acting on it.  thus, this guy is a creep.	8
1	I live in Texas and sat through an abstinence presentation when I was 11. It had nothing to do with hey sex is awesome, but don't do it. It was more about respect yourself and your body and wait for someone you love and that loves you too. it was probably about as useful as the time DARE had a present in my 4th grade class back when I had no idea what drugs were. The only things I knew about sex came from a book my mom gave me when I got my first period and that was more about anatomy and relationships.	8
0	i never said men don't have any responsibilities when it comes to getting pregnant. it's 50 50.   but the decision to have an abortion is weighed heavily on the female.   ultimately, let's make sure unintended consequences don't happen, and improve the system so men and women stop making mistakes and also stop repeating them.	8

1	This was a homeschooling conference, yeah?  One that invited a religiously affiliated speaker?   She was preaching to the choir.  Of course they bought into what she had to say, they're homeschooling for religious reasons because they think that society is overly secular/corrupt/sinful/etc.	8

1	Unless it's for weed, then the NFL brings down the hammer hard which is fucking stupid.	8
1	&gt; If they don't have evidence there is nothing they can do.  They can keep the case open, instead of, you know, the alternative.	8
1	Were you also involved in the discussion about Kim Kardashian?  In most cases, it's a pattern of behaviour that determines if something is inappropriate or not - one off instances are very hard to judge, unless they're clearly egregious (like groping, etc).  In this case, based on only your post, I'd say that it was slightly inappropriate in a class environment, but really more in the category of a joke in bad taste. You're perfectly valid in feeling that it was insulting (it was a joke made at your expense) but unless the behaviour continues, I'd put it down to crass humor and let it go.	8
1	There's a [New York Post article](http://nypost.com/2015/05/03/woman-to-become-ny-firefighter-despite-failing-crucial-fitness-test/) that says that two other women in this cohort passed the test and are angry that she was let through.  Not sure how that calculates into the 44 women part.	8
1	Why not Moon Moon?	8
1	&gt; One asked why the words "strong female character" were not in his vocabulary.  They didn't watch Firefly then. Zoe Washburne is one of the strongest female characters I know in popular TV-series. Same with Inara Serra and Kaylee Frye. All strong in their own way.	8

1	Good on ya mate!  Glad to hear you are healing.  Beautiful animal in the pic btw.	8
1	They are yes, problem is though that videos that end up there spread out over hundreds of porn sites.      I discovered a video of me with a couple who i had a threesome with years ago who had secretly recorded it.   Once i started to investigate it i found it on dozens of sites.      Pornhub will take it down without any issues but it will be impossible to get it off the net completely.      I don't mind it so much as the video quality was pretty bad and only those very close to me and who also knows the couple might recognize us.   And those are people where it wouldn't be a disaster if they found out.	8
1	I for one applaud his gender equality based take on face-punching	8
1	Oh, you mean you gave birth the way you're supposed to. In Canada they make you lay on your back to deliver and labour and you're usually going to an OBGYN unless there's enough midwives in your area for demand.	8
1	Have you filed a police report? You should.	8

0	Far too many subtleties in job performance to be able to accurately analyze every employee on a numeric basis.  Of course, HR folks *try* (unsuccessfully) to do that, but it doesn't actually work in the real world.  What usually ends up happening is everyone gets paid the same regardless of job performance.	8
1	You would do well to stay away from that one.	8
0	I'm not fully behind Anita by any means either - I do not think she is doing it right. But I agree with a selection of her opinions. I also respect your opinion to disagree entirely with all I've said.	8
0	Well the mayor is correct. We live in a jungle, and your safety is your own responsibility. If you don't want to get raped, don't walk around bad neighborhoods, and don't wear clothes that entice sexual deviants.	8
0	Nah do it all the time	8
0	Haha, I had no idea that it was a famous Captain American story arc.  In the movie, my reading was always that Captain America was just a prop that Black Widow used to reveal Hydra. Black Widow grows as a character, gives up her role in the shadows, and finds a cause that she cares about. Captain America is already public, and noble, and good. That's why she knows he will help her.  So even if it's about Captain America, Black Widow is the character that grows and Black Widow is the character that is most in control of her own destiny?	8

I know I'm just going to be down-voted here... Obviously..   But could someone explain this to me? How would you ever fucking think that's ok? Jesus Christ...	8

1	Oddly enough the immigrants tend to vote Democrat in Texas. It's why the politicians' gerrymandering is aimed at only making votes in white (non-Hispanic) rural areas count. The entire Rio Grande Valley and three of the four major cities (very ethnically diverse) vote Democrat.	8
1	I'm a woman who works at a Lowe's. If we don't ask people if they need help, we could get written up for it. I've had to ask men in Tool World if they need help picking out a drill, even though my department is on the other end of the store and I know next to nothing about power tools. I wouldn't take it personally!	8
0	I guess Wax doesn't do well in heat.	8
0	If you're talking about ridiculous and ineffective lengths then I formally disapprove of you speaking for us dudes. lol Thinking back, the OP did imply that the guy smoked weed so maybe your farfetched strategy did occur to him.	8
0	By walking alone and being female, you are inviting people who are looking for females that are alone in order to rape them. What the mayor was wrong about is the fact that walking alone doesn't actually increase your chances of being raped, and that women are I'm general very safe in public places. That's just a factual error that someone needs to educate him on.    The issue isn't victim blaming. It's just that he was wrong.	8
0	They did the exact same thing when they decided they didn't want blacks to vote.	8

1	What rights should the baby have while the mother is laboring though?	8
0	No one's been sexually exploited? If you think me saying 'he's awkward' is my substantiation for sexually exploiting a child then you can only have misunderstood what I'm trying to say. Perhaps I'm not being very clear.	8
1	I stopped talking to a (male) friend of mine in college after he casually mentioned to me how he would go after 15-16 year old girls because some of them were so "flattered" that an older guy was into them that they'd be more likely to "put out" for him. Creep.	8

0	So it's impossible for the woman to be mature for her age and ONLY possible for the man to be immature for his age?  It couldn't possibly be the woman being more mature or - gasp - a combination of the two that makes them actually compatible in their maturity?	8
0	She is in so far over her head it is ridiculous.	8
0	Currently I'm not getting help for it. When I was 16 I went to a therapist to get help. I was with her for two years and she definitely helped me through the tough times, but there wasn't much she could do for the sexual attraction part of it, she only really helped me deal with the guilt/depression/anxiety that comes with it.     &gt;Its not cool and people shouldn't be expected to accept it.  I agree completely. I don't want pedophilia to be accepted in a similar way to homosexuality. But I do think people should understand that it is a mental illness and not a choice.	8

0	No one is saying that you can't take steps to protect yourself. Every woman I know does this. But saying a crime didn't occur or it is their fault a crime occurred is the issue.   If someone breaks into your car and steals your stuff, no judge says 'oh well they shouldn't go to jail because it's your fault' or 'well you own a soft top convertible so you were asking for it'. It is still THEIR fault for committing a crime.	8

0	&gt;If he was buddies with the model, and the model contacted the women and set it up, but let him have sex with them in his stead without telling them - it would be rape.  Except...this was NOT the same situation.  They women WERE talking to the man they had sex with. They weren't set up by a friend...they set themselves up with the man they were talking to.	8
0	None, in my opinion, however I don't think making these arguments and raising these points qualifies as overt homophobic behaviour.	8
1	I would make copies of some of the evidence. Then I would be honest and tell him what you found, and that the relationship is over.  He will probably not react well so be prepared. He will probably move to delete everything on his laptop promptly and say that he's changed and doesn't do that anymore, and he's ready for a new life with you.  Don't believe it--marriage will not change a man.  I'm sorry and best of luck. Be happy you aren't married yet! You will find someone that deserves you!	8

I can understand if you felt uncomfortable and social issues can make like difficult so that may have been hard for you, if it was a booth you could have put your bag next to you or a coat or something, I agree that it's not cool to invade somebody's space though.	8
1	From a packaging waste standpoint I can see the appeal.	8
0	I mean another thing is that it's not like he's ridiculously into kids or only kids or anything like that. I just don't know im still so torn this is one of the hardest decisions I've had to make.	8
1	Have you tried just not answering?  What I generally do with pushy guys like that is just stonewalling them.  "Hi, I'm John, what's your name?"  No answer.  "Can you hear me?"  No answer.  And so on and so forth.  Don't look at him, don't react in any way - just ignore.  The way to head off these encounters is to stop them before they start.	8
0	Don't ask, don't tell, and don't care.	8
1	That wolf looks terrifying. Great picture and hats off to you	8
1	When will women finally reap the consequences of making rape jokes? Visit the comment section on any news story about a sex crime, and half the commentors saying "I hope he gets raped in prison" are women.   Nobody should make rape jokes	8
0	Yes.  very much.  Tell a parent.	8
1	Punisher.  Punisher mad is real dark.  Edit: punisher max	8

0	Blame Facebook and the age of "everybody uses real names". It bred a false sense of trust.  The last thing the US government wants, now, is for people to become anonymous on the Internet - as it makes it harder to track people - even if it would make people safer.	8
0	You are making a big assumption that it is only white men who are trying to restrict abortion.  Go to an abortion picket outside a planned parenthood sometime and at least in my experience there are more women there than men.  Yes it is mainly white men passing the laws but they are doing it at the behest of their constituents and many of them are women who are pushing the abortion restrictions just as much as the men are.  They don't look at it as government having control over womens bodies to them its all about killing babies.	8
1	If she considers a jc pennys catalog to be pornography, then I'm a  bigger porn addict than him	8
0	Technically it is natural, if you're already past puberty and sexually matured, its not unnatural for someone to find you attractive, only the artificially high age of consent in the US makes people think it's weird. In other parts of the world 15 year olds can consent to sex. Does that make entire continents of the world pedophiles..? I dont think so.	8
0	Yeah, no, I'd bet a sum of money that this was taken out of context.	8
0	Ok, but I'm not sure how that makes him creepy. he's likely pursuing multiple avenues to have kids at this point.  and again, I'm not saying he's right, i'm just not understanding the "creepy" label that's being affixed to him.	8
0	Sorry men can't be predators anymore. :'(	8
1	Statistically more women who are already mothers get abortions than the stereotypical idea people have in their head of the irresponsible young party girl.	8
1	Man for the first couple days I have to wear a tampon *and* a pad and even then I leak sometimes	8
1	I have the same age gap with my wife, and the only time I've ever noticed it is weird is when talking about our childhood, now with our kids.  Like, a song comes on the radio, and it's like "Ohh, I remember this song from 6th grade Valentines day dance".  And she remembers it from college.	8
0	I'm 23 and my fiance is 30... but we didn't meet until I was 20. Legality comes into play here. If it's meant to be it will happen, but just wait until you're old enough to feel comfortable with this man's interest. As of now, it's obvious that you're having reservations about the whole ordeal so it's not the right time.	8
0	there's also another perspective for a 23 yo if you're willing to admit that him being a pedo is the only reason  the 15 yo kids are very weak competitors for that guy, he can be nice to the 15 yo girl, never cross the line, and in a couple of years he'll be the first one to get that pussy	8
1	Where did she say that?  She was talking about 23 year old men who *pursue sexual relationships with underage girls*, not all 23 year old men. That's a pretty big difference!	8
0	So it sounds like there could possibly be treatments for you girlfriends condition but the doctors are unwilling or unable to provide them (if they exist).	8
1	&gt; there are plenty of liberal feminists who think women are treated like walking pornography by men.  I hope you can tell the difference between thinking women are treated as walking pornography... and thinking women ARE walking pornography.	8
0	I really love seeing someone get shutdown like this	8
1	No shit. Implants are never about the bra. (Also a member of the club) Part of the fucking problem is that even if you find the greatest bra in the world, at some point you *take it off* and your self-esteem goes with it.	8
1	&gt; They explained it to her clearly two different ways. I work in the medical field and tearing is a lot worse than an episiotomy. Instead of having a 2 inch incision you might get a 3 inch tear.  It's *her* body and her decision. If she wants to chance a tear, then she gets to decide, not the fucking doctor who thinks he's god. That woman said "NO" several times--and he did it anyway. Good grief. No means no!	8
0	They're just conspiring to make you take your clothes off, that MUST be it	8
0	How neat.   The people at tables look so bored though.	8
0	Uh, I'm going to say don't do this. Go tell a supervisor or manager. Going to coworkers can be seen as spreading rumors or starting trouble which can lead to her being fired. Granted she doesn't work there anymore, but not the best advice saying go to coworkers. Upper management will handle it appropriately.	8
1	Its just the huge mindset of this rape apologist culture that loves blaming the victim that we have to get away from. Of course the Mayor is an ass for saying it but if you look around, you wont believe how many people feel that way. It demands education, understanding, sympathy, and a desire to treat everyone equally. You better believe if it was his wife, sister, daughter, or friend, that mayor wouldnt be blaming her for walking alone and being attacked.	8
0	&gt;but considering it hasn't been a week since the alleged attack  You know most crimes that get solved get solved within the first few days, right?  &gt;you don't finalise an investigation if it's unsolved or if there are still criminals at large.  You do if you don't have any leads.	8
1	No, you're not being dramatic. That is extremely inappropriate and disturbing to hear, especially from a *teacher*.   I can't tell you what you should and shouldn't do, but if I were in that situation I would definitely bring it up with administration.	8
1	We were supposed to smoke together (smoke weed). Don't know if that makes it better or worse. Probably worse.	8
1	You can leak out of a pad too! I just generally don't like the "bloop"-y feeling you get every time you stand up or roll around in bed in the morning. It makes me paranoid.  Then again, I haven't even tried a cup yet. So not sure what that feels like either.	8
1	Well really we should presume innocence for anyone until they are proven beyond a reasonable doubt to be guilty and are convicted.	8
1	The other kids get taught by certified health teachers.  This Isn't A Parental issue. Some parents don't know shit about sex ed. Some are still practically children themselves. Some Parents will Teach abstinence only, or use fear to prevent their children from sinning.  We need to collectively teach our youth about safe sex and how sex is a natural, not shamefull thing. This Texas community is failing at that, and they're experiencing the out come.	8
1	Oh, girl I know all about that.  After dealing with abuse I completely latched onto animals. I'd bring home birds, snakes, squirrels.. You name it. My Mother was *never* happy, but being around animals has always been insanely therapeutic. It's so awesome to see the same relationships heal fellow abuse victims!  That and diving. Disappearing 100 feet down is so serene; it's like outer space.	8
1	I think this is what people aren't getting. It was a **public** post that anyone could find, and she just happened to have found it sooner rather than later. I'm surprised people are defending him, when he still pulled a dick move, that I feel is a lot worse of an offense than searching someone's username and seeing a public post of theirs.	8
0	I'd have to know more about the committee.	8

0	The Night and the Moment:  http://netflix.com/Movie/The-Night-and-the-Moment/60025591  This is like a more sensual and less dramatic Dangerous Liaisons.   A lot of the movies in this genre tend to have themes of infidelity or other controversial topics, but if you are OK with those I can throw a couple more recommendations.	8
1	My fiance got me a morganite.. it's rather pretty when it's set in the ring.	8
1	Sex Ed community educator here!  Some parents don't have the tools of knowledge to give their children a solid understanding about sex. It doesn't make them bad parents, just human beings. Also a lot of young people don't feel comfortable asking their parents questions, and unfortunately some families don't have health dynamics. The great thing about outside sex ed education (even as a supplement to what youth may be learning at home) is that they can be connected to so many youth health resources in their community or region! :)	8
0	Not at all. I'm subject to my own logic, otherwise I'm a "rape victim" for having a couple drinks while my bf did not. If someone told me me I'd been raped, it would be annoying. The truth is that this is a story we're taking at face value and we have no idea about Matt's side. It seems like your mind is already made up in spite of the lack of hard facts or commentary from him.	8
0	&gt; They were acting without authority   They **were** the authority.  Congress approves treaties, not the president.  &gt; attempting to undermine the president's negotiations  They needed undermined.  The fact that Oboma wants to let Iran have nukes and you have issues with Congress wanting to stop it baffles me.  &gt; Will they actually be prosecuted? No  Only thing you got right so far.  &gt; but constitutional scholars do agree they were in violation of the Act.   No they dont.  A few uber leftists that would support child rape if Obama said it was a good idea supported it, but that's about all.	8
0	The investigation and the comments are separate issues.  If the claim was false, hopefully the accuser sees some sort of penalty for wasting police time and money.  That does not negate the shitty comments made by the mayor. In fact, they only served to distract from the real issue, so he received a double whammy of his own doing.  I mean, just because the original claim was false, does that mean the mayor should be allowed to got and start advocating that women should stay in kitchens?	8
0	no one is suggesting we send this person to jail. But to think that you are safe is dumb. You are never safe. you will never be safe. You must be on guard at all times. The world is a scary place. It is filled with monsters and criminals and people who want to do you harm. You might feel safe, because you are raised in a world were other people have been keeping you safe without you taking notice, but in the end, the only person who is responsible for your safety is yourself.	8
0	I'll be honest, I laughed.   I'm sorry but your overreaction to a kiss is crazy. Why is a stolen first kiss worth crying over? Girl, how you gonna feel when your parents die?	8

1	It's not a Right-wards movement, it's moving to the Left. Consider Communism/Socialism and their banning of basically any religious iconography.  Horse-shoe theory fits though.	8
1	People blame hysterical social justice extremists who brook no middle ground in works of art nor do they allow fictional female characters to show the complexity and range of human experience, because it somehow reflects on all women.  You don't have to equate that with all feminism, not unless that is *your* feminism.	8
0	Wait. You think sex workers are taxed on their income? There's one state in the US where prostitution is legal - Nevada. Everywhere else, there's no legal income to tax. Those who work as strippers get paid in cash, so reported income is taxed, but I am willing to bet very few people report their actual income.   Taxes are not why people work. You are taxed on the income reported to the IRS. It's a fairly simple concept.	8
0	You're not military.  So why are you so determined to depict women as shitty soldiers?  I don't see a point in pretending your agenda is any more subtle than that.	8
1	The folks arguing against abortion clinics and birth control in the same breath feel that people should live and die with the consequences of their actions, and that their taxpayer dollars shouldn't go to helping people who make bad decisions.  In their mind, bad decisions include having sex before marriage. If a kid in this town gets Chlamydia, that's her own fault and it serves her right.   These folks would watch the world burn around them just so they could stand on their patch of unscathed soil looking down their noses at the blasted wasteland and say, "See, look at what the depraved sinners have wrought."	8

0	The idea of discrimination is typically based on some type of group a person belongs to. Race, religion, gender, sexuality, etc. While I agree that there should be certain exemptions, such as film, the connection to "stupid people" doesn't entirely apply. Intelligence and qualifications for a job are considered to be individual merits and tend not to fall under the idea of discrimination.	11

1	I'm an atheist, and I am perfectly fine with criticizing pretty much all aspects of religion. However, there have definitely been times on this sub where I found the posts/comments to be unproductive and/or immature. I usually don't say anything because I recognize that there aren't that many places for atheists to vent, but it's important for us to be open to that criticism and not just dismiss it as stupid believers getting upset when we point out science.	11

1	I completely and one hundred percent agree. He even voted against the USA Patriot act...i mean come on guys	11
0	It's really quite simple. For me, marriage should be between a man and a women. It's as simple as that. If we start moving away from that definition, who knows what might happen?   This is probably going to be downvoted, /r/atheism doesn't have a very good track record of following rediquette, nevertheless, I'm still going to post it because it contributes to the discussion.	11
1	Let's not forget that sanders has the record to mobilize non voters as much as Ron Paul did.  He's a man of his word and young people love him.  He's also old and white, which old white people can get into as well.    Source: old white republican family I'm from would never vote for a young, minority, or female candidate.	11
1	You'd be better off finding a unicorn. There is no scientific evidence either way when it comes to a god. The best thing you can do is explain why the universe doesn't need a god, explain to her the fallacy of the cosmological argument, and to apply Occam's razor to god's existence. Or, if you feel your mother is up to it, just show her some of Richard Dawkins' statements on the issue of the existence of a god.	11
0	I would like to do something similar. I would like to set up shop across from a group of religious assholes, say, at a book-burning or protesting at a clinic. Then I'd proceed to take out a Bible, tear out a sheet and mock wipe my ass with it before throwing into a trash can. I would definitely set up a camera somewhere nearby in case I'm attacked by one of these religious nutbags.	11
0	Personally, I would never stoop to interacting with a Holocaust denier like Chomsky.  Edit:  In this thread:  Downvotes from leftist twits who don't really know shit about what an asshole and poseur Chomsky actually is.	11

1	&gt; A lot of people won't vote for the guy because they are afraid he won't get elected anyway.  Well he certainly won't if they don't vote for him... but seriously, if he can win the nomination for one of the two major parties, he' automatically electable. The obscurity problem will have long been solved (and probably will have been, even if he doesn't win the nomination), and the fear that moderates will vote in droves for a Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, or similar are largely unfounded, it seems to me.	11
1	He just hates college girls probably because no one wanted him when he was in college.   'Conditional forgiveness'? That is soo similar to the tithe scam the church did before.	11
0	When push comes to shove, very few people believe THAT strongly. It's almost like our ancestors kind-of - oh, I don't know, let's call it "evolved" - some sort of will to stay alive.	11

1	&gt;It seems as though if they really thought the deceased were moving on to a "better place" they would be celebrating or something.  This has been one of many large bothers for me in life. Those people are literally told that this person is living the best life in heaven possible, yet they mourn? Don't they also think they'll be back together in heaven soon after they die? Then what use is mourning? A self-glorifying weep for the few short years you'll be apart?  Clearly, applying logic to religious thinking is the task of a crazy person.	11

0	See this comment: http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/34i28v/london_buses_know_whats_up/cquz8co  &gt;If the state must recognize a marriage of two men simply because they love one another, upon what basis can it deny marital recognition to a group of two men and three women, for example, or a sterile brother and sister who claim to love each other?  Why is sexual love between two people more worthy of state sanction than love between three, or five?	11
0	Me too but this sub is getting out of hand.	11
1	The problem here is that people think of atheism as a belief system like a religion, but it's really not. It's more like an activist movement, like Mothers Against Drunk Driving or something like that, only with underage superstition instead of underage drinking. Atheists have Humanist belief systems, they have Objectivist belief systems, hell, even Taoist and Buddhist belief systems. But when you get together to talk about atheism itself, you're basically talking about what's wrong with theism.	11

1	Now your religious freedom laws require you to argue that the government should be in the business of defining what religion is, which ones count as real religions and thus which ones get the exemptions.  Congratulations, you have violated the constitution.  This is exactly why the seed phrase "sincerely held belief" was used.  They wanted to be able to veto other people's (read: nonchristians') professed beliefs.  Seriously, you do not want a government with the power to decide on the sincerity of your beliefs.  You do not understand religious freedom.	11

0	Don't blame me for your bad life decisions.  &gt;You know people were having kids LONG before there was a concept of marriage, right? Kids have nothing to do with marriage.  And people also killed and steal long before their were courts or concepts of property. Civilization was not made in one day, it's achievements and the conditions to make it possible were also a long process in the making. Does not mean we should do away with the fundamentals of civilization because some people have no self control or honour.	11

1	"The [ultraviolet] photograph reveals that the word purportedly used by Tacitus in Annals 15.44, chrestianos ("the good"), has been overwritten as christianos ("the Christians") by a later hand, a deceit which explains the excessive space between the letters and the exaggerated "dot" (dash) above the new "i". The entire "torched Christians" passage of Tacitus is not only fake, it has been repeatedly "worked over" by fraudsters to improve its value as evidence for the Jesus myth."   http://www.textexcavation.com/documents/zaratacituschrestianos.pdf	11

0	Where did I say or even imply such mitigation?  That's right,  I never did.   Get your head out of your ass and stop with the jingoism already.	11
1	Chomsky came off as unpleasant, but that's not something I judge important in a discussion of this sort.   On the level of who provided substantive arguments/examples, Chomsky clearly wins. Harris hit on one note, and even that note he played poorly.  Which I consider a shame because I like Harris (outside of his thoughts on geopolitics of which he seems poorly informed and rather naive.)	11
0	So what happens when a Democrat gets elected to office and Republicans decide they don't want to pay anymore. Or visa-versa. You are talking out of your ass, with absolutely no basis in reality.  And by the way, the tax on luxury items that you descibed? Similar concepts have been proposed in the past. They were voted down by conservatives	11
1	There are some other hints (or fans with way too much time on their hands), too. For instance, his pen name. Carver Edlund is a reference to the show's two head writers Jeremy Carver and Ben Edlund, and, according to the actor, acts as a avatar of Eric Kripke (the creator and showrunner at the time) to comment on a meta level about past scripts and history of the show.   Also, during his last scene, he's dressed all in white.	11

1	Have to agree. Humans have been held back so much by certain religions. Can't imagine how far advanced we'd of been by now if there were no persecutions of scientists, women, ideas during particular times in the species history.	11
1	&gt; *"At the same time, I hate shitty people who draw Muhammad just for the sake of being offensive dirtbags to Muslims."*  I stand up and applaud them just as much as I would stand up and applaud anyone who is offensive to Christians, Jews, Scientologists, Mormons or another other man made religion that is based on fairy tales, plagiarized mythologies and absurd fictions.	11

0	If it's "almost completely false" it isn't completely false, thus the Jesus story could come from the story of Horus.	11
0	You know how we mock Christians when they claim to be an oppressed community in the US?  I feel like we should mock atheists when they claim religious American politicians are same as the Ayatollahs, ISIS, the Taliban or the leadership of any other crazy theocracy.   Yeah Ted Cruz is a bad guy, he panders to morons with a holy book, but he's nothing like the Ayatollahs of Iran.	11
0	As again you focus totally on the negatives which I understand there are a lot.  I just figured we throw a positive in there every once in a while not to sound so hateful towards religious people is all I am saying.   Essentially we talk about bigots but end up being one ourselves by being so untollerable of them.	11
1	From what I gathered she seems to be a right-wing racist mainly in it for the publicity.   Hebdo on the other hand is about as far left-wing and hippy as it is possible to be. They publish a satirical magazine that for the most part takes on French politicians, with occassional forays into other matters that have been in the news.	11

1	This would be true, unless you remember that Israel once fought 4 different nations at the same time that were about to launch an offensive to destroy their entire nation. Since then, they've been less shy about doing preemptive strikes against people who regard them as people who need to be exterminated.	11

0	Such puny little "miracles" precipitated by the Creator of the Universe (that is if we ignore the likelihood of deception by the "miracle workers" AKA saints); a disease is "cured" when no cure was expected, a man's hands bleed, a statue "weeps" and on and on. Why doesn't God grow a new limb for an amputee, or maybe have one of this priests vanish just prior to raping a child or perform any large scale demonstration of His infinite power?

1	They don't have the right not to be offended, but if someone who is offended announces that he will kill anyone who offends him, you'll claim that these are the natural "consequences" of exercising your free speech.

1	I rarely disapprove of anything posted in this sub.  That being said, I enjoy mockery of religion, because it is a vice that the human species has yet to shake off.   An ill-founded, dangerous vice that *we know* was created by *us*.    I see theists as normal people, not subhuman or evil.  I'd consider some theists to be better people than I am.  They are just misguided and/or unenlightened in their worldview.	11

We're still losing at the polls on important issues but the margins are getting smaller. Equal rights votes were 80/20 a few years back. Recently 51/49. We're almost there.	11

0	You're framing it as if there's only one way to do it.   Much of what's going on in this sub, to a Scandinavian like myself, looks like cultural backlash against the highly religious upbringing a lot of Americans get. It looks a lot like acting out against your parents, using typical teenager logic of "this is the truth - fuck how the world looks".	11

1	&gt; Today I'm writing to say I'm sorry, I apologize, and I ask for your forgiveness. We who have blindly defended Islam and called you Islamophobes are tragically wrong.  I like finding out that I was wrong -- even if in part.  In that moment, I can change my mind and stop being wrong.   It is good to see one more person accept reality as it is.    If only more would, we could deal with the problems more effectively instead of fighting over what reality is and what real issues are overemphasized or dealing with entirely fictional wrongs that distract us from addressing reality.	11
0	Sources? and second what makes you think that those graphs show any correlation? they appear to show that the law were instituted at points that either were peaks for homicides or were already experiencing an up or down trend.Third do you truly believe that gun restriction would minimize the amount of homicides? Finally what about those who depend on rifles for their livelihood, for example I help run a cattle ranch in central UT and during calving season we have to keep a watch out for coyotes to prevent them from preying on the newborn calves, if we cut this linkage by outlawing firearms usage then my local economy would take a severe hit.	11
1	Please don't post clickbait titles like this.	11
1	&gt; They don't go to church, they don't read the bible, they don't try to morally improve their lives in any way, in fact, the ones I'm acquainted with just live whatever lifestyle they want, the same as anyone else.  Most all Christians are Powerball Christians. Because "you never know". And oddly, Jesus wants what they want, not the other way around.	11
0	&gt; There's nothing wrong with Islam.  Bullshit, especially given your flair. It seems like the only reason you're an Islam-loving atheist (what a contradiction!) is because you hate Christianity and/or Christians.	11

0	You repeatedly refer to Mohammed as pedo. That's not insulting?  Grow up.	11
0	You're right about that.  Although you would admit (I hope) that many Christians *believe* that gay marriage is sexually immoral.  Remember what my post was about.  It was to show why a Christian could be concerned with gay marriage while not being concerned with eating bacon.	11

0	I didn't know that about Tacitus, but I'm talking about Josephus. There is little evidence to suggest the passage itself was forged, and there is a second passage that mentions Jesus in connection with the martyrdom of James, and nobody really considers that a forgery. It's possible they both are, but you can't take it as given.	11

0	IMO atheism shouldn't be about mocking others.  It should be about just going on with our lives believing that there's no higher power, and the search for the answers to the universe.  Almost like religion combined with science.  I just see hating others because of their beliefs (and face it, not all cheiatians are pedos and not all muslims are terrorists) as the problem that most religions face, and I want atheism to be above all that.	11

This is done to prevent people from voting for the candidate least likely to win the general election from the opposing party, allowing their TRULY desired candidate a better chance to win.	11

Is it wrong to teach a child that evolution is "just a theory," completely undermining any future learning about scientific theories?   I value the public's proper understanding of science *more* than I value the feelings of creationists. If you want to be *wilfully* ignorant of modern science, you're going to be laughed at. If you think you're right, then present your credible evidence and the laughter will quickly die.	11
0	This or that argument ... it all boils down to the basics;  * If any gods exist, why would they require that humans do work for them?  Aren't gods both knowledgeable enough and capable enough to speak for themselves?  * Since no gods seem to show up, what we are left with are claims by humans of gods.  Why not skip the pretense, and speak human to human?	11

1	Running around with the power of god smiting anyone who opposes you is hardly David vs Goliath, even in the case of David vs Goliath.  The characters in the Torah don't have to take as much on faith because God actually shows up from time to time, reassures them and kills their enemies.  Sorry, not to be pedantic, because it is definitely portrayed as an underdog story today.	11

These people had balls to do things I don't, and funny or not, criticizing religion (and any authority for that matter) is necessary. If the criticism isn't valid, it can be refuted.  If it is....well then it is.	11

0	For you, not for me.	11
1	This is exactly what I think is wrong with many believers. They want to ignore all the nasty, gory shit in favor of "mercy" and "grace". The actual bible is full of horrific things, and they actively choose to pretend it isn't there or justify it through some serious mental gymnastics.  Also, you wouldn't need mercy from a god who wasn't abusing you, just sayin'.	11

0	It is true though. The rich elite, who are shareholders of many corps, control what the "truth" is by paying large donations to universities, pharmaceuticals, and research companies, which in turn suppress or destroy the careers of scientists who have new truths which go against the interests of the rich elites.   A scientist without a research grant is useless.  First it was the kings, the priests, the tyrants, the fascists, and now it's the rich.	11
0	&gt; If you don’t lose sleep worrying about the wrath of any of those guys, why make an exception for Ik Onar?   A secular way to look at Ikonkar is just as an abstraction over various concepts of God because Ikonkar is roughly equivalent to panentheism.	11

0	Not everyone agrees with that.http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2014/05/foghorn/debunking-mother-jones-10-pro-gun-myths-shot/   Keep in mind most of that stats include criminals that own guns.

1	One of the problems with the abortion debate, is that the time that something is deemed to be "life", is basically all down to personal opinion.  Some people think birth, some people think conception, come people think 14 days after (when it's assured the embrio won't split into twins), Roman Catholics think that you shouldn't use a condom because it's preventing life.  It's all one big clusterfuck.	11

Does your boss get to pick and choose if he wants to fire you if your taking hormones for birth control vs whats nessisary for an endocrine disorder?   I've got a rare endocrine disorder, my body doesn't make hormones on its own. If I don't take hormones shit gets bad for me. So, can I get fired for taking medicine necessary for living a healthy life?   This is fucking insanity. I want to cut the balls off anyone who votes yes on this so that they too have to start taking hormone supplements.	11

1	Which, if you think about it, is also super racist.   It's like: no no, white people are fully responsible for their actions and in-control of their will/motivations.   But since you're brown and "underprivileged" you can't possibly mean what you say; you're clearly just a victim of something an evil white person is responsible for.   It removes all agency from the people committing these acts in a really racist way. Which, humorously enough, means these claims aren't even internally consistent.	11

If it is any consolation, I believe that as long as someone is remembered with kindness, they are never truly dead. Your sister will live on in the memories you have of her, of the good times you shared together, the lessons you learned together.   Eventually you will teach your loved one, your children about her and they will have a memory of her as well. The positive images you choose to share about her will change people for the better in some small way.	11
1	&gt; A lot of Christian fundamentalists were upset that the movie dudn't stay faithful to the bible story  Didn't it stay more faithful to the Jewish version, which came earlier and was based on Gilgamesh, so really it's the Bible which didn't stay faithful to the original...	11

You know this is the same country that needs only the mere mention of the ghost of socialism to scream their heads off and refuse to adopt a universal health care system that saves them money right?

1	I'd say there is a smudge of truth there.   A few years ago, I was drinking outside with some friends. Some very Christian folks and an atheist friend were in a conversation about that, that slowly escalated to arguing (the Christians were also hammered and bragging about sleeping with strippers, but that's besides the point of the story).  The conversation came to a head, when one of the Christian girls broke down and said the atheist must be wrong about death. If there's no heaven, she wouldn't be able to see her grandma again, and she couldn't fathom that.   Some people take there shit persoanlly.	11
1	That depends. Do you want to continue to have a tension-free relationship with your mother? If so, you might want to soften up the wording on that a little bit. Naturally everyone's different, but unless she's sending you emails with 'GET SAVED OR BURN IN HELL' type messages, it's probable that she's just trying to help and thinks she's being nice.	11
1	Which I always thought was kind of silly. The biblical version had a 600 year old man building the largest ship ever built with his three kids and bronze age tools. But now once you introduce the rock monsters it's suddenly not realistic.	11
1	Also this quote highlights one of the problems - it's somehow all about what is being done with dicks. A chick going down on a chick - yep, not a problem with that, lesbians are cool. But two guys? Not acceptable! Silly people...	11

0	&gt; It's the criticism of the idea that I am not allowed to draw him.  Except that you are allowed to draw Muhammad.  You are basically insulting people and then twisting their anger as some some sort of attack on your rights. There is nothing admirable about insulting vulnerable group on purpose. Being an asshole does not automatically make you some sort of freedom of speech advocate.	11
0	That doesn't mean it is no longer pedophilia though, it just means that pedophilia was normal.	11
1	That's my feeling on this.  Try mocking the religion of the organizer of this group and her tune will change in an instant.  Her intent is to mock Islam and convince people Christianity - or her brand of it - is the one TRUE religion.  She's as messed up as the people she's mocking.	11

1	He's taking the church's argument and running with it. The church, in their attempt to show injury if marriage equality is passed, gives the position that, with the enactment of marriage equality, they will be thought of as bigots when they exercise their religious rights to speak out against gays. Their logic- if the rest of the country accepts gays, it will make the church authorities look bad for their self righteous disparaging condemnation of a minority, so we should not allow equal rights.  If that doesn't make sense, then you are not alone. What they don't get is, they are already thought of as bigots.	11
1	Catholics are always rewriting history.   They started with Jesus and worked their way up to the 21st century. The number of people who deny fascism was a Catholic right-wing movement is staggering.	11
1	&gt;In response, they told her that the accident happened BECAUSE of her disbelief, and if God doesn't heal her son, it's only because of her disbelief.  Sounds like those people are pieces of shit and so is their god, if he exists. But I guess he always had a thing for torturing innocent people.	11
1	It's like words have lost all meaning to these people  I feel offended for my dictionary  &gt; Starnes said that he recently watched the movie "Selma" and that it drove home for him the realization that  conservative Christians today are the face of the modern day civil rights movement.

1	Or worse, the talk consists of sex as a bad thing, sexual thoughts being "disgusting" or "immoral", and/or that women are little more than baby factories.	11
1	Better yet ask her if it has converted her to a Nordic religion because Thor.  Makes about as much sense as you converting because Christian mythology is in those movies.	11
1	This is indeed a miscarriage of justice, but the article misses a pertinent fact about the sex-on-the-beach couple.  They are not both facing the maximum 15-year sentence; only the man, Jose Caballero, is facing that.  His sentence would be less except that this is his second felony; he spent eight years in prison already for cocaine trafficking.  It's still outrageous, but I feel that articles which point out injustices like this one should be written honestly, and include all relevant facts.	11

1	For those of us who care about the things churches in general are trying to do regarding the law in the US and elsewhere, it does matter.    If believers leave organized religion, that reduces the authority and political power of the churches.  That's a good thing in my opinion.	11

0	&gt; No one provoked anyone.  I have to disagree with this. I think the idea of resorting to violence over drawings is as abhorrent as anyone here, but let's be clear, the event was a plain and simple Fuck You to Muslims.

1	I wasn't calling Christians homophobes. For the most part Christians are good people that believe in equal rights like our friend the OP. As an institution it is homophobic. It's a contradiction that most Christians don't see. They're supporting the institution that contradicts their ethics without even realising it.	11

0	What is surprising about the fact that most subscribers to a subreddit called r/atheism are not fond of religion? Yes there is sometimes very serious discussions about religion, but a lot of the content is going to be anti-religion circle jerking.   Yes, close-minded people can come from any background. On average, however, nonreligious, atheist, and agnostic people tend to be the least judgmental and most open-minded. The fact that almost all arguments against homosexuality come from a place of religion speaks volumes about it.	11
1	Maybe it's in keeping with the Original Sin motif. Screw something up and your descendants have to suffer into perpetuity.   Generally the really arbitrary contraventions are given eternal suffering, while the guys who do the really detestable stuff get a pat on the back.	11
0	But if your admitting that you don't know why would you just switch automatically to the side of non believer. You say that you don't know so if you have a problem with faith why not just leave it there at agnostic and say that you don't know and therefore don't have a position either way on the subject. I mean atheism gets you nothing but if this whole god thing is true it gets you that eternal life dealieo that sounds pretty good to me. Not saying that you don't get that if your an atheist  but id rather be safe then sorry.	11

0	So basically an atheist by your definition is someone who doesn't believe in god but instead choose to not believe that even though there is no proof either way? So you have a god and that god is nothingness. Because you choose to believe that there is nothing even though there is no evidence either way.   I'm not saying to believe I'm just saying to call it what it Logically should be Agnosticism that god is unknown and perhaps unknowable. thats its by calling yourself an atheist your saying that you know the unknowable which is logically impossible.	11

0	That argument is incredibly flawed, what would you do come out and take every handgun owners weapons? You are correct that game rifles are rarely used in murder but this is likely due to clip capacity, cost and ability to conceal more than anything. In a country that already has a large ownership of hangings and rifles the fact is that only the law abiding citizens would turn over their weapons in the first place, leaving them more vulnerable to those who refused.	11
0	Being liberal does not mean you have feel the need to rub your ability to offend people in their faces. Even if you think it's your right, there are far better ways of conveying your ideology... Like you know arguments and reason. Attacking Muslims with this petty bullshit is just feeding a fire. You want to end organized religion? Convince people to believe in science. Show them why what you follow makes sense to you. Don't fucking purposefully offend them just because you can.  You guys don't deserve to call yourselves open minded.	11

0	What is the difference between "New Atheism" and "atheism" small "a"? If they do not believe in a god, then they are atheists by definition.

What justification can someone give to claim they don't believe that particular quote?	11

Sometimes you have to fight evil and be bigotted to do it  What a ridiculous statement. Inglorious Basterds was *A MOVIE.* People who would do that in real life *are* a hate group, and should be prosecuted for it. They're no better than the people who shot up CH, or tried to shoot up this event.	11

1	if they are on birth control then they must be a slut because why would she need birth control if she wasn't a slut?

1	Thanks for the Kudos, but can I ask you one question? Most interpretations of Christianity are against homosexuality plain and simple. The bible is very clear on it. If you're for equal rights then can you not see that you are in support of the very institution that goes against your moral ethic?	11
0	Just because others face extreme oppression, does not mean that lesser violations of rights are not oppression.  Legitimate government services can be voluntarily funded.	11

1	Several of the [images submitted to the contest](http://s1167.photobucket.com/user/AFDIMotoons/story) referenced Aisha. Some of those images are NSFW and many of them are tasteless - that's half the point of events like this, but fair warning anyway.	11
0	Precisely the point. The legislation has little direct effect on the rate of homicides.	11
1	I'd never say the satanic temple abuses anyone's freedoms.  Merely beautifully pointing out instances where (other) religions have stepped over a line and enthusiastically saying "oh really? then me too!"  with perfect undeniable logic just in time to make everyone feel really uncomfortable.  I'm so happy they exist as an institution.	11
1	I made my first political donation tonight. And it was for Bernie 2016!  I also pledged (on Facebook, and now on reddit) that I will donate 1% of my salary if he gets the Democratic nomination.	11
0	Peer-reviewed historical research that questions received wisdom? How terrible.	11
0	Welcome.   Its never PURELY recreational.  Okay sex *evolved.*  If you consent to sex, the probability of pregnancy is something, compared to zero for not consenting sex(except rape).  You agreed for sex, you agreed to that small probability of pregnancy. Now its your choice to do what ever you wish with the embryo.	11
1	And people say this guy *isn't* a terrorist.	11
0	No.  Still the 2 party system.	11
0	Lol!  Good joke.	11
1	Uh, guys, that isn't "doing it right".  I can send you a URL.	11
1	Maybe we should thank the terrorists for separating the true liberals from the cowardly sheep.	11
1	If I understand it correctly, they can't draw Jesus or Moses either. The fact that muslim extremists aren't bombing people for drawing other prophets shines a light on how much of this is really about religion and how much it is about violent nationalists swallowing anti-West propaganda hook, line and sinker.	11
0	It's not limited, it's non-existent.	11

0	&gt;I don't think either of us are going to come around to each others way of thinking  I'm really not that interested in convincing you to come around to my way of thinking. I just hope that anyone reading this thread will realize that you are ascribing motivation to the 145 dissenters that they have not suggested for themselves. It's nice that you think that their objections are for some other reason, but their letter makes it pretty clear that they think Charlie Hebdo should not be given an award for their cartoons because they are insulting to Muslims and Muslims are a disadvantaged group.	11
1	It's also inherently contradictory to claims that a god is benevolent.  If you can't assess the actions of a god when those actions appear to be malevolent then you're basically saying it's goals are inscrutable.  If they are inscrutable then you cannot claim that those goals are either benevolent or malevolent, merely that the goals of the god are unknown.  Which then leaves us with normal methodologies to attempt to assess benevolence or malevolence.  Very few gods ever win that sort of comparison.	11
0	Yea, we talk about things.  We've read books together about sex.  She's only 10 mind you.  Probably don't need to go too far down the rabbit hole just yet.	11
0	If I drew images celebrating 9/11, 7/7, columbine, sandy hill ect ect I'm sure people would try to stop me with violence or killing.	11
1	I never understood why they allow these pieces of shit on Campus to begin with? I would pelt him with eggs so hard.	11
0	They don't have the right to marry. A marriage happens between a man and woman to found a family. Everything else is an imitation of that and should not be encouraged or given the same legal privileges as a wife and husband are granted for the sake of society.	11
0	Why would I vote for him because of his stance on religion?	11
1	There is no dialogue to be had between reason and unreason.	11
0	No, but you should be striving to be at that level. What possible excuse does a person who walks around with a flag of logic and a bible of the scientific method, mocking and trying to eradicate wishful-thinking off the face of the earth (as exemplified by this subreddit) have? You don't want to be an obese person telling an alcoholic it's unhealthy to binge. But who am I kidding, most atheists are armchair logicians. Must feel good to denounce irrationality from that shell of wiki-link fallacies, eh?	11
0	Some one wearing a swastika is immediately linked to an ideology genocide and hatred and is without a doubt radical.Someone wearing a head dress is most likely someone peacefully and moderately minding their own business, having no intent to offend.	11
0	Islam is more than just a religion(it's an Ideology), but damn, even buddhists are crazy. Humanity has a real knack for grouping people into "us" and "them". You'd think we would have overcome our primitive instincts by now...	11
1	Indeed. I'd go from an atheist to a misotheist. Not from an atheist to a Christian or Muslim like they want to believe. My antitheism would still be strong as well.	11
1	Interestingly,  the pictures only include people.  At least in the Noah's Ark case, similar concerns would apply to animals, no?  While the initial breeders would not necessarily be genetically similar, subsequent breeders would be.  So we would have lots of dangerously inbred creatures.  Wait a minute - that would *totally* explain my cats.  The creationists must be right.   Checkmate, atheists!	11
1	haha, i did not think it possible for someone to actually misunderstand this stuff more than harris already did.	11
0	Very mature response. Please continue.	11
0	You do realize, during the lifetime of Mohammed, marrying someone that young was normal?	11
0	Mmm whatever you say champ	11
1	I literally asked this question in /r/Christianity about why they believe in the canon of the bible in its modern form(s), and in the end, from multiple people responding, the answer I got was "I take it on faith". That's it. And somehow it's still so crystal clear to them that all the other denominations and religions taking it on faith are OBVIOUSLY wrong. The irony is so thick, you can swim in it.	11
1	You know, I am all for freedom of speech, and I enjoy seeing a variety of groups who are able to share the same space while spreading their completely different beliefs and values. However, I was not okay with being bombarded with many, large, graphic bloodied fetus posters on my way to class the other day. I feel the line needs to be drawn somewhere. I haven't seen any pro-gay marriage 'protesters' holding up pornographic posters, I don't want to be subjected to viewing something I would most likely never see otherwise. Not completely relevant, but both are hypocritical nonetheless.	11
0	What were the aims of Charlie hebdo if not to offend Muslims - an aim shared by the right wing hate group in Texas?  Politics makes for strange bedfellows, indeed.	11

1	don't you know? r/atheism is the new r/lgbt	11
1	Premature evangelism is a curable condition, but if you have an erection for Jesus lasting more than four hours seek spiritual guidance from a rational human being.	11
1	How come anytime dick is mentioned, someone somewhere always manages to link it to rape no matter how irrelevant it is to the subject?	11
0	Yeah, those constitutional amendments sure are pesky. You can tell a lot about a politician by which amendments they actually respect.	11
1	To be fair, if you weren't indoctrinating her into believing a God then there's no reason she would believe it on her own.	11
1	How is this petty? All that was asked was for Netflix to be accurate in their categories. "Noah," belongs in "Movies Based on Real Life," just as much as, say, "Fight Club," or the Harry Potter movies.	11
0	I did and I see that you were hurt and now don't believe in god, but there's no reasoning between the two.	11
1	This may be hard to understand if you've been immersed in Christian mythology all your life but--  I really don't think it's necessary to understand how the universe began. I certainly don't want to *pretend* to understand. The only honest thing for me is to say "I don't know." So that's what I do. I don't struggle with it at all.	11
1	Pretty sure Catholicism is a requirement for membership actually. You also have to be a male as it is a "fraternal  order". My dad's been one for like 30 years. There's probably a discrimination on gender alone here.	11
0	He won't be the Democratic nominee so it's unlikely.	11
0	Well, they didn't create the universe and we honestly know jack shit about the universe. We can pretend we know all the answers and say there isn't anything out there , but that's kinda arrogant imo. I think a god is more abstract than a unicorn. I think it's unfair to pretend they're the same thing and dismiss it. I'm just trying to express my opinion though, i don't want to seem like i think you're wrong. Nobody really knows.	11
0	&gt; If taxes wasn't required not a single conservative would pay taxes.  Not necessarily. They would pay a reasonable amount as long as they know it's not being used for liberal purposes. A reasonable amount is 10% or less of income.  Also, there are ways to tax without requiring people to pay them. For example, have a sales tax that only applies to luxury items. Those who are buying necessities, or secondhand, or the lowest price level of a given item would pay no tax, while those who wanted more expensive items would be *required* to pay the tax that goes along with it.	11
0	Extra fail. Those posts are about a kidnapping and torture case and have nothing to do with doing drugs.	11
1	&gt;"Faith is the proof of evidence not yet seen."  Evidence not yet seen proves nothing; thus  Faith is nothing.	11
0	No . . . you can draw whatever you want. Just don't be surprised or offended when radical lunatics fire at you for doing that. Case and point that time I subconsciously drew a set of cocks on my final. I wasn't surprised I failed and was sent to the office :(	11
0	Insist that your husband watch a half dozen you tube debates of theists against Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris. If he can't see the absurdity of "faith" after that leave him. Move to a progressive intellectual state and start your life over. It will be hard but you will in time look back and wonder how you ever got involved with him and church in the first place.	11
0	All Abrahamic religions' main texts have stuff against gay people, and they also have a long history of bigotry and murder of gays. This is true. But there are peaceful Christians and Muslims and Jews; I honestly think a lot of the bullshit is cultural, and it's unfair to paint the religions per se as bigoted, when really they are the creations of people, and are practiced by people.	11
1	If pr team you mean average Americans who are excited about have a good candidate to vote for, then yes	11
0	So, guys who don't believe in anything need protection? Sorry, but that seems like nonsense.	11
0	How about you learn how to read you fucking moron? I didn't say about forcing people to do stuff.  First of all, my reply was on the fact that it's not GREAT.  Secondly, affecting others' freedom, and this is how you use the apostrophe there, is EXACTLY what this is about. No, you shouldn't be free to brainwash others. I don't give a fuck they might be your children, you don't own them and their minds. Shit like this is why society has the problems it has.  Off you go now redneck child.	11
1	The number of people who believe that they'll be having "show and tell" sessions with kid's genitalia is staggeringly high.  People end up believing what they want to believe - as usual.  Hopefully once this gets pushed through, and the controversy dies down, we'll end up with some better educated people on the other end of things.  It's a nice thought, anyway.	11
0	I don't think OP is trolling, I think they're serious about their stance and are actually trying to make a valid argument... probably the worst place to do it but, oh well.	11
0	You can try to wrap their actions in all the "Free Speech/ 'Murica" you want. But they were provoking and offending, not opening up a line of discussion.	11

0	You're quite defensive there. I wasn't trying to give a lesson my friend, just stating my opinion on a matter as many do here. Perhaps it is the first time I state it succinctly, but it was entirely my purpose in both of my other posts, although it seems it wasn't apparent Mr. "I'm not new to this and don't need a lesson."	11
1	He wasn't referring to genesis stories. He was referring to the countless times in exodus and later stories where israel was instructed to erradicate entire towns and cities purely because they were "full of sin" or they worshiped other gods. (Deuteronomy 13:13-19 for example)  Here, have a link to a christian site explaining why it was okay that god wanted entire cities killed, including why including the children in the genocide was a "merciful" thing to do: https://carm.org/bible-difficulties/genesis-deuteronomy/why-did-israelites-destroy-cities-and-kill-all-people-inside	11
0	wow that's a lot of n00bage. being 14 doesn't account for that. You should pay more attention in general probably.  good luck.	11
0	I really want to peer into a looking glass somewhere and see the world we would have had if Bush lost and we had Captain Planet as president	11
1	Jerusalem. Not Tel Aviv.   Tel Aviv is the more secular, progressive, etc of the two, which is why it's really surprising that this started in Jerusalem!	11
1	Nice Try, Fox News.	11
1	...I'm a college kid from the Philippines.	11
0	I see why they would rent out to religious groups and I'm fine with that. This group is, in my opinion, a hate group. I think it would be reasonable for a school to deny a hate group like the kkk wanting to do a blackface contest. They could've found a better place to host their event.	11
1	If they don't want non Christians to celebrate their holidays then they should start by having them removed from government calendars.	11
0	Yeah but it does have vitamins in it.	11
0	Im a godless heathen.	11
1	Students. If a teacher had a child that was under 4 they could place them in the child care facility for free *if there was an opening*. If a student's child took up that last open slot then the teacher's child was bumped out of the free child care service. You can imahine how the teachers treated pregnant students. One girl, who worked very hard and studied, went to after class assistance, still received a 4 as her final grade and was not permitted to pass 10th. The teacher who failed her? She was pregnant.	11
0	Hope and faith are not always superstitious words. It's the source of the hope and faith that determines whether they are.  For example, the "lifetime of benefits" you mention is one **hope** (i.e. desired expectation) that you have **faith** (i.e. trust) in. But your hope and faith have a non-superstitious basis. Probable, but not guaranteed.  And spontaneous is pretty much a fancy way of saying supernatural, isn't it? That is, a cause and effect relationship beyond our scientific understanding at the current time?  The way you stated it, one could even say the spontaneous thought was an **inspired** one. :)	11
0	Agree to disagree. We've heard a lot about wars being built on religion but wars are inherently built on different beliefs which are always going to exist (whether it's about gods, the role of genders, how to raise children, whether cats or dogs are better companions,  etc.). The billions of people who lived their short lives on this earth with some belief about the god(s) that governed their lives did not wage war against other people. They lived and died and that's it.	11
1	I'm generalising, but... Most of the world is religious. Religion is sacred to the religious, so they are not likely to criticise it themselves. We do not have that reflex, and so we stick out. If mice could talk they might complain about cats. :P	11
0	He said something like   "Apologist! Dumb fucking n****r! Read a fucking dictionary"   and   "You dumb n****r (I don't remember the other part of this sentence)."	11
1	Yeah, literally all top ten of them. Except for like 4 or 5.	11
0	Too bad more people don't realize that its just good moral stories if you pay attention to the message but like they always say common sense isn't so common	11
1	This would also mean that by his definition, committing genocide in order to glorify God would not be evil... This is exactly the kind of fanatic ignorance we all fight.	11
1	So god intervenes by murdering a young man to punish a mothers disbelief, but thousands of kids starving to death every day isn't a concern? Gimme a fucking break. How could anyone, even the dumbest piece of shit that ever walked the Earth, believe that?	11
0	Sure. I used to live with a gay dude. As a roommate. He was a very bad person. Criminal. Sick. It kind of tainted my view of them.  And over the years the ones I've known had some serious issues. I guess I am a hater. But it's not because of the gross sexual practices. It's my personal experience interacting with them. The gay women I've known aren't much better. They're typically more nuts than the men. Usually angry and and trying to out-macho straight dudes. It's transparent and pathetic.	11
1	That would just be obtuse.	11
1	"Wah, we chop people's heads off, engage in holy wars, enslave thousands, take away rights, try to shove religion into schools, form lynch mobs, bomb abortion clinics, murder cartoonists and send death threats but some atheists are being *mean* on the internet!"  Disingenuous much?	11

0	Huh? You in no way refuted anything that was said. Try again.	11
1	She does know it's fictional....right?	11
0	And because they do, we are supposed to like gays for some reason? I'm pretty sure this is a fallacy. What if I'm an atheist and not comfortable with gays or support gays?	11
1	Yet another example of why the US is insane. Collectively "you" elected these people. It's democracy.    Those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad.	11
1	Pointing out a fact like islam being the largest misogynistic organized force in the world violating women's most basic human rights in both scope and severity gets you labeled as a racist in most news sub's.	11
1	similar situation. I've been an atheist almost a decade now. My wife and kids are still Christians. My parents are older, so I haven't bothered telling them, and probably never will.   There's so much great information out there to recommend.  * Richard Dawkins - evolution, science * Christopher Hitchens - vitriolic critiques of religion. * Sam Harris - Everything from Reason/Skepticism to Morality/Spirituality. * Bart Ehrman - Biblical History * Richard Friedman - Who wrote the Bible * Carl Sagan - Science/Skepticism * Dan Barker - FFRF/Activisim  Best of luck to you.	11
1	Exactly. I can prove it with this 2000 year old post-it note straight from the starch himself.	11
1	Cue the screams of religious persecution...	11
1	Out of interest, why are you not for gay marriage?	11
1	If god is more powerful than Satan/Lucifer/Beelzebub and is in control of this world, why does he need a brain-dead, chubby god-zombie to fight his battles for him?	11
1	Christian fundamentalists don't care ahout religious freedom. They only want their freedom to force their religion and their religion only.	11
0	People were over it until these gay issues started getting blasted all over the media. Look at the following Freddie Mercury and Queen had. He was openly gay and no one cared. His music is timeless. Fast forward to now where all you hear is gay rights and people get upset.	11
1	Nice... but the author seems to have a bit of a blind spot for Christian teachings.	11

0	Analogy inherently cannot be exactly equated.  You don't get the point.  In Paul Erich's analogy, He compares species to rivitts. Now are the two things equal? No they aren't. But certain aspects of one are and can be used to explain the other.  Don't go for semantics and try to understand the principle in my analogy.  You see this is the reason religion works. It provides a way to get people to agree without engaging in long fruitless discussions. People will accept a concept  instantly and readily if they are fearful. (Remember the terminator's move, to get Connor to agree to come with him?)	11
1	Am I the only person that thinks nobody should be making out in places like this?	11
0	Yeah, I'm sure he was 'invited' to all those places he supposedly slaughtered, right?	11
1	"could god make a hot pocket, so hot, that he himself couldn't eat it?"	11
1	"With it"? OP her-/himself should be careful. ;)   *Edit: Clarifying that this was a joke. Nothing wrong with OP's comment. Thanks, V_Elze27.*	11
1	Of course they should - it's not solely used to prevent pregnancy. Many gynecological conditions need to be regulated with hormones; AKA birth control	11
1	&gt;in the context of it being a fact instead of a theory  It's both.  Evolution happens, that's a fact.  The theory describes how we think it happens.	11
0	Ahh finally someone who understands the challenge! Yes they could that would indeed be convincing evidence however unless I saw you alive and in person, the evidence would not be enough. I will now listen to your arguments about god	11
0	You got the analogy, but not the message. No one listens to the fly, because they just see it as a nuance to be swatted, but they never stop to think whether the fly is right. I guess to put it in other words, atheists are only a small group that hovers in front of the innumerable group of religious people. We try and tell people what's going on, but they only see us as a nuance to be pushed away as they cover their ears.	11
1	That web site is 404.	11
1	Several times it's been pointed out, life coming into existence is Abiogenesis not Evolution. You haven't started the debate yet and you're already engaged in fallacious logic.	11
0	I noticed that i skipped a line in that analogy. Maybe it will make sense now.   Consider you are sick. You need medicine to get well again. (You are alive and need to reproduce to replace yourself) medicine is necessary for that. But it is bitter. Only if it was sweet...	11
0	You'd be surprised. At my church, including me, we dont really mind. Conservative Christians are actually very accepting.	11
0	I don't have to be religious to feel disgusted at this.	11
1	Or you can just ignore Ibrey, who is a Catholic apologist.	11
0	From which atheist's standpoint? Because atheism is just lacking any belief that gods exist. So it doesn't say anything about the value of life.	11
1	I sea what you did there.	11
1	I was about to say the same. If Netflix thinks I'd enjoy God's Not Dead I think we'd have to break up.	11
0	Why are those terrorists there, in their own country by the way, and why do they have a history of violence?	11
1	Our group of idiots aren't as successful at shutting education down like your group of idiots.	11
1	Well htere is a logistical problem to that, being god could solve it.	11
0	If the USA is so secular, why do we have a painting of the Prophet Muhammad in our Supreme Court building?	11
1	The hardened thing, when I read that passage, really got to me. My 8-year old self: "You mean, Pharaoh was totally just going to let it go and everyone would be at peace...but God MADE him change his mind---so he could kill more Egyptians? Why? And couldn't have God just killed them anyway?"	11
1	Perhaps not intentionally, but it does recontextualize the subject in a way that overshadows and diminishes the actual damage he's caused. It "softens the blow" in a way that feels unearned.  This "victim of circumstance" bit frames the discussion in a way that somewhat directs focus away from where our attention should be.   Namely, that this is a fully-functioning, adult person of sound mind, and he made the deliberate choice to fuck over an entire class of people... despite having *first-hand knowledge* of how his actions would harm them.	11
0	Correcting incomplete understandings of theology on /r/atheism   Rather an uphill battle you have ahead of you here.	11
1	They have to declare war on *something*, and burning women as witches and beating up homosexuals have fallen out of favor.  We're all that's left.	11
0	Wow, the anger of indoctrination is strong with this one.	11
1	No way in hell he can appeal to the moderates, or the new generation of informed youth. This clown isn't a problem. The biggest problem in our government today? Jim Inhofe and his duty to United States Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Oversight. Get him out of here.	11
0	Oh so you're a transphobic bigot with no interest in reality. Thanks for pointing that out to me, now I know not to bother with replies to you.	11
0	Are you going to vote for him? You're giving up before even fighting. Is pathetic. You have you idea what's going to happen. If you support him, spread the word; tell your family, your friends, your neighbors. Post of facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. Don't just give up without a fight.	11
0	Hey, as a straight guy, I'll fully admit my gays are way more cool than me.	11
1	Apparently, it's the law for public spaces (state universities and colleges). They can't come into the buildings and do it because that falls under different rules, but open spaces where they aren't impeding access to buildings makes it legal. I hate it, too, but it's great that this guy is calling the dick out! I saw a similar picture a few months back of some counterprotesters at an abortion clinic. This couple held hilariously mocking signs pointing to the anti-abortion jerks. We all should really make it a life goal to do something like this at least once.	11
0	Accepting until they find out something unacceptable about you.	11
1	"Muslims kill because Islam is a barbaric and oppressive religion.  We Christians kill to save people so they can go to heaven.  Jesus has blessed us in this holy crusade."  - Every bible thumping nut in Southern America.	11
1	Stewart made fun of Hilary and Obama plenty too.	11
1	Would you file a freedom of information request?	11
1	I'll poke fun at whatever I want. No belief is sacrosanct, no notion is above ridicule. This is a pillar of modern society.   Once we make a belief beyond reproach it becomes immune to criticism. Once a belief is immune to criticism it will fester and become toxic.	11
1	Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate; and hate leads to suffering.	11
1	Atheist EMT here.  Recognize that your grandmother was a good person, that her life improved the world, and that her death is a tragedy, like all deaths. Recognize that, though the neural patterns which encoded her personality may be irreversibly scrambled now, the effects her life had will linger in your memories, and in the memories of everyone who learns her stories. Tell people about her, and know that a little bit of her memory goes with the listener. We may die, but death is only a subjective oblivion. Life continues without the dead, and it is only through the living that their legacies are preserved.	11
0	If atheist are seen as a more tolerant group it makes them more appealing.  Why be gay and religious where they hate you when you can be gay and atheist where your are excepted.	11
0	But was that their intent? Were they really trying to show that freedom of speech should be maintained in spite of religious feelings, or were they trying to cause a violent reaction to use as justification to condemn islamists for violent reactions?	11
1	The lack of any evidence of god existing.  Note that I do not actually claim no gods exist.  There might be one, but if one or many exist they have failed to provide any sufficient evidence of existing. Therefore I am an atheist.   Most people I know easily dismiss gods such as Thor and Krishna as silly, yet exempt their own god from the same criticism.   Are you doing the same?	11
1	This is the problem with mingling tax dollars with religion and with patriotism.  Nobody gave a shit if you didn't recite the pledge before 1900.  But now, if you don't say it then you hate america and "the troops".  It's all bullshit.	11

1	It seems to me that Chomsky addressed every question posed by Harris. He outlined the reasons why he believes Clinton's motivations for the Al-Shifa attack are immoral (reckless retaliation without regard for human life), why he doesn't think the professed intentions of world leaders are meaningful, and why he refuses to engage Sam in a public debate. Just because Chomsky comes off as accusatory doesn't mean that his remarks should be ignored.	11

1	Well they started it with a five year plan and a good story for those first five years.    They planned that to be the end of the show originally.   I don't think any of them imagined, year 10, year 11, oh ya we'll still be telling this story.   Now they are just making shit up, so it's bound to be a bit more.. directionless.   Though I kind of like how really the next five years are just dealing with the fall out of the first five.   I mean you dramatically alter the power balance of heaven, it's gonna have some repercussions.	11

0	&gt;Robert Oscar Lopez suggests that the federal government should be prepared to pay “reparations” to children raised by gay and lesbian parents, just as it did [with $1.6 billion] to Japanese-Americans who were sent to internment camps during World War II.

0	Everything is a matter of interpretation, that's how our brains work. What matters is if that interpretation is valid. If you have a collection of works about a religious figure and then attempt to interpret those works as non-religious I would respond by suggesting your interpretation is at the very least less than valid.	11

1	Those Democrats might fault abstinence-only-education, but the explanation is simple:  After the devil went down to Georgia looking for souls to steal, and was defeated by Johnny and his fiddle, he cursed nearby territories with disease.    Georgia itself is no stranger to sexual disease and nor are surrounding states.  Without bringing abortion statistics, STD treatment, and divorce rates into the equation, how truly holy is Crane High School?	11
1	Actually, by an off duty cop working as a guard.  He used his service pistol.  The swat team didn't get to the shooting until after they were down and dead.  It's only important to know the difference because for years people have said a citizen, armed with a pistol would be no match for a terrorist with a rifle.  This shows a trained person with a handgun can take care of business.	11
0	Yes, the shooting was terrible, and I am in no way trying to excuse it. But The Muslim community in  Irvine has decided to ignore the whole business because the woman running the event is a right-wing "attack the Muslims" type, who is trying inflame support for a Texas "anti-Sharia law." Her immediate reaction upon hearing of the shooting was "we are at war." Almost like that was the point of the contest--to incite a killing so she could declare war.	11
1	i'm sure people said the same thing about the parents, school employees, and elected officials when they were young. and the cycle continues...	11
0	I think you don't get what I was talking about. I was talking about Muslims. Muslims hurting people and blowing things up. Not about these 145 self-important people.          As far as these 145 people go. They are whining because Charlie Hebdo the feelings of a bunch of theists.        It the theists who encounter Charlie Hebdo content are offended, why should I care? Much less feel sorry for them. The criticisms hurt so much because they are valid. If they don't like it, the theists shouldn't look at it. Or maybe they should write about it on their Deadjournals while listening to The Cure in a dark room.	11
1	I'd say the bigger danger with anal sex is not doing it properly. Pornos make it look like it's not really any different than vaginal sex when the reality is that anal sex is much more dangerous if done improperly. Since a lot of these parents are christian, I wouldn't be surprised if some of their kids were going to use 'god's loophole' so they should at least know how to do it safely.	11

0	I'm an atheist but I'm not anti-religion. I think religion does a lot of good for a lot of people. I would like to see less hate in this sub partly because I don't think believing their is no god(s) makes someone hate people who do believe in their god(s). Honestly, it'd be awesome if we found and celebrated more people who are atheist or who do good not because of religion but because they believe in simply helping people.	11
1	If you are short, fat, and furry (and a dude), then I'm the big spork with a big spork.	11
1	I mean, I disagree with the sentiment they're giving off, but not the letter itself. There really isn't much room for hope when logic plays a key role.   At the same time, if we inject a healthy dose of logic into everyday life and society, we can have high hopes that this earth might just be a better place in the future.	11
0	What is the truth in this context? That if you purposefully provoke people they might react? Not that the perpetrators reacted accordingly, a violent escalation is a weak move that shows they have no arguments to begin with, but I feel like this event was purely designed to antagonize Muslims, which it did splendidly. So if not that, what were the organizers trying to prove? *EDIT: this came off as far too defense about those religious pricks. There has to be a better tactic than pushing every religious extremist to become a suicide bomber...I'm glad they managed only to get themselves killed.	11

1	But what on earth would citizens with firearms actually be able to do? And what do you say about the fact that every armed revolt in the past years has either failed utterly, turned into a military dictatorship, or been squashed? It's a masturbatory fantasy to assume that armed citizens could bring about violent change in a good direction.	11

1	Sex without consent, regardless of relationship status (boyfriend/girlfriend, husband/wife), is still rape. The relationship isn't a free pass to do what you want with the other person without their consent. Period.

0	&gt; I don't know you but if you are a good person and not killing or anything you don't deserve to go to hell.   You won't convert anyone with that attitude.  Religion is spread by 4 basic methods:  1. Deceit   2. Fear   3. Torture   4. Murder  It is always thus. Never forget it.	11
1	Dawkins himself tweeted a link to a free Farsi translation of The God Delusion a couple of months ago. Pretty sure he wouldn't mind this at all.	11
1	/u/Crusoe was saying that it's true from a legal standpoint.  Philosophically, if one has to have the belief that something is untrue, then you believe in all things until you find out about them.  For example, Until just now, you believed 100% in the purple cheese mountain under your bed.    Because if lack of belief is a belief, then not having knowledge of something makes you a believer in it - because you didn't have the knowledge necessary to not believe in it.	11
1	&gt; 50 percent of the congregants will fall away from their church, because they won’t be able to take the persecution.  How does this persecution manifest exactly?  They talk about it a lot, but I never have a clear idea of what it is.	11
0	I am a Pantheist. I don't have a particular religion that I ascribe to, but I think religion offers some people a spiritual growth - that's important to a lot of people.

If you agree come join us at /r/SandersForPresident. Everybody is welcome	11
0	Mocking religious people does absolutely nothing to further our cause. It's the tactic of the juvenile and bitter and only alienates us further from being taken seriously (aka, the reason so many people hate this sub and why it's no longer a default after being one for years).   Sure, you're pissed at religion. I get that. But if you're being pragmatic, and as atheists we have an obligation to do so, you take the catch flies with honey approach. You also don't resort to strawmen for a good ol' chuckle.	11
0	I'll make sure to tell em about sensitivity and gay privilege trolling too.	11
0	Sooooo tired of posts like this appearing at the top of r/atheism... This has nothing to do with religion or atheism. I subscribed to this sub for thoughtful talks from Dawkins and Alan Watts; for religious debates like the one between Ken Ham and Bill Nye... not for the constant gay debate. Most people on this sub agree with with the stance on "gay rights" that this image represents anyway. Just seems to be a constant stream of this crap.	11
1	&gt; We just don't because we can't extract money from these people.  Strange how most people don't like to work for $0/hr.	11

1	I believe that good people are good in spite of their religion, not because of it. I like to think I'm a good person. Therefore if I were a believer, I expect I wouldn't act too differently in how I approach people or situations. Compartmentalization is a powerful thing. Then again, so are the lies of religion. The widespread belief that having religion makes one more trustworthy is one of the most pervasive and objectively false lies that humanity has ever played on itself. The fact that your friend seems to have fallen for it doesn't surprise me. It's tragically common.	11

1	The America people didn't elect GW Bush, the Supreme Court *installed* him, to much controversy. Rightly or wrongly, an election did not, ultimately, decide his position as president. While it was technically legal, it was widely disputed as illegitimate and corrupt.	11
0	&gt;being from the middle east  Anecdotal evidence doesn't prove much.  &gt;Most countries torture apostates until they go back to Islam if they were citizens of the country. Expats are just either deported or hanged. This is how it is in muslim countries.  Then insult those doing the torturing and the leaders of said countries.  &gt;And if they majority are at fault then the minority should not defend the majority if they truly believe the majority is twisted.  The minority have no obligation to speak out, but some do. Those who actually defend such actions deserve some criticism and insults.	11

Probably confused and scared, just wanting to fit in. Becoming the biggest good ol Republican he can be, making everyone proud. Now put in a position to vote based on what the people want.

1	Good news: There is not a small chance your spider survived being flushed and ended up in a nice, dark sewer where there are lots of insects to feed on.   Adressing your question, technically every life is valuable but there is such a thing as being realistic. (Most species of) spiders have no real cognition going on, they are more like biological robots who react to stimuli in predictable, preprogrammed ways.   The life of a mammal is more valuable than that of an arachnid, the life of a primate is more valuable still and the life of higher order animals with sentience, sapience and a theory of self the most valuable of all.	11

1	&gt; It's not that arrogant to say that when it's clearly spelled out in the Bible.  Since the bible is a work of fiction, I'd say that makes him delusional too.    It's the fact that he claims to know things about the universe without supporting evidence and then tries to tell people how to live their lives that makes him arrogant.   He's also a reprehensible charlatan and snake-oil salesman who lies to people for his own profit and self-aggrandizement.	11

How similar is each area going to be next generation because of how we were taught?	11

Some do not believe their "job" "mission" is done here on earth.    Finally, Most strong believing Christians (and Atheists) don't fear being dead.  It is the final cause of their death that worries them.   No one wants to die in a painful way.	11

Explicitly, declaratively. There would be no such competition if not for the fact Muslims find it blasphemous. The desire to offend Muslims was witting and concerted.  &gt; Drawing a picture is never cause for violence. Violence over a drawing is always wrong.  I'm glad you agree.	11

1	I don't think hardened homophobes are the target, more like the 'casually' homophobic like older people or those from slightly sheltered backgrounds who spend far too much energy getting upset about gays.  It's just emphasising the point that it ain't no thing, don't stress about it.	11
0	So you want me to give proof of, "some unwritten doctrine"?	11
0	Of course, but, this always comes down to you declaring that you can judge God. Why do you think you have that authority?	11
1	The fact that you are doing exactly what the joke is poking fun at amuses me. Both sides over react an equal amount I'd imagine.	11
1	For the same reason they go to church to file their taxes! Duh.	11
1	&gt;that most monotheists pretend doesn't exist  I believe in most cases, it's more of a case of inability to comprehend or unwillingness to ponder.	11

1	I used the Q&amp;A section of this debate in my classroom...specifically the question, "what would change your mind?"  Ken: Nothing.  Bill: Evidence.	11
1	Nah, you have to try to understand where the person is coming from.  In my case my wife's aunt heard the news of my mom's passing and expressed her sympathy to me in the best way she knows how.  That's what I take away from it, not the words but the intent that she was trying to express words to me that she thought would be comforting.	11
0	I don't know why people find it necessary to poke the beast, respect other people's beliefs even if they don't respect yours. I don't understand why atheists are so hell bent on trying to mock any part of religion they can, honestly have some decency, both sides have their moments, but this is immature	11
1	Honestly, your claim seems a tad fishy to me.	11

0	Sorry, but you're just incredibly wrong and trying to twist information in a way that makes you sound right. If you are honestly denying that there is a difference between whites and hispanics in Texas then there is no reason in even arguing the point as you're refusing to acknowledge important information. Texas is not extremely white. You want to see extremely white? Try New Hampshire.    Drawing your conclusions based on U.S. census data paints a very vague picture.	11
1	There is one: "I think it's gross and can't stop thinking about it unless it's completely eradicated".	11

1	They keep saying they are oppressed but never point to any specific example of oppression. If this was anything like the civil rights movement he would have examples. It isn't, he doesn't and he is a fucking cunt for making the comparison.	11

1	The sheer amount or proof that an unborn baby can perceive in the womb about the existence of Mother is staggering. That has to be the worst example ever.	11
1	Did you break their rules? If so, they have every right to ban you.  Mohammed "married" a 6 year old girl. He was a pedophile by today's standards. But going around screaming "MO's A PEDO! MO's A PEDO!" is still being a troll so I'm not surprised you were banned.  Bringing it up calmly in a relevant discussion probably would not have gotten you banned. But by your comments here, it seems your comment in /r/india was probably more of the trolling variety.	11
1	In the Victorian era lesbians were seldom (if at all?) prosecuted under 'gross indecency' laws because it was thought that they can't have sex so therefore no indecency.  It was a lot easier to 'pass' off as a spinster or whatever.	11

1	&gt;I just want the Israelis and Palestinians to get along. The whole conflict is both parties' fault.  That is the ironic part. They all rely on the exact same early scriptures telling each that they are special and that they should kill others not like themselves.

1	It's a false equivalency. Religious bigots actively work against equal rights for women, atheists and gay people.  The worst I have seen an atheist bigot do is make snarky comments online.   And a persons behaviour on a particular subreddit influences how any statement of theirs will be received. This is a normal human behaviour, in any social group online or offline, once someone has become reviled by a particular group this group is then unwilling to listen to anything they have to say.	11
0	This has nothing to do with atheism.   Some people hate gays. Get over it. Some people are christians. Get over it. Some muslims kill heathens. Get over it. Just get over everything. Get over it.    10/10 logic. Something exists, therefore you should get over it. Normally, I wouldn't mind this. But most atheists pretend they're on some intellectual high ground and that they're the giants of logic and reason, instead of being part of some massive circlejerk not unlike the religious kind.  This comment exists. Get over it.	11
0	Thanks for this. This is the one post from this sub that isn't complete shit, because it's actually informative instead of more circlejerking condemning religion. When I first saw this guy's name on Reddit I was intrigued, but too lazy to go look up his stances on issues that are important to me. This post fills in the gaps.

1	The singularity wasn't discussed in this exchange. The question is if crushing people like walking on hundreds of ants is any more horrific than burning a dozen ants with a magnifying glass.  But on the singularity, AI might be able to dynamically adapt to conditions, procedurally learn behavior, generate combinations of concepts, or mimic social behavior. But constructing true human cognition may not be possible.   Chomsky has spent 60 years exploring cognition in particular and he knows enough to say there isn't enough comprehension of the subject to apply it to hard science.	11
1	Yeah because jesus never actually said shit about contraception despite some sects of christianity touting such.	11
1	I could easily name a hundred christians who are pro-choice and pro-gay.  Their religion, of course, does not agree with them.

If you live in a country with capital punishment that can't even be questioned but even if you don't, I'm sure there are actions people commit that makes it "right" to kill them. Mocking muslims with the intent of insulting them is willingly perpetuating hate between us and is the same thing extremists do, just using other tools.	11

0	Well? Shouldn't your representative represent the views of his constituents and NOT himself. If that's how his constituents wanted him to vote, then that's exactly what he should have done, regardless of he himself was gay or did or did not support (any) bill.  Actually this is usually the problem with the getting the anti gay marriage bills through.... Representatives ARE representing their anti gay marriage constituents (in order to win re election, but whatever).	11
1	Just another example of how Christians read religious freedom as being "you have the right to be whatever Christian denomination you want."	11

0	There's a difference between legal rights and human nature. Murder is illegal, but human beings can only be provoked so far. If you started an organisation dedicated to calling my kids stupid and ugly, you'd be protected by the first amendment, but you'd still be an asshole and I'd still try to kick your ass.	11
0	Jesus didn't say anything about homosexuality in the Bible, but he did hold up the Old Testament as the law of God. If someone ran around saying "not one jot or tittle shall fall from Mein Kampf" would you accept "Sure this guy loves Mein Kampf but he never actually said anything about Jews" as a good argument that this dude isn't a raging anti-semite?	11
0	I not believe in the marriage of gas is that like a breed of dogs or a place? No I'm just kidding but I don't feel this morning and I don't support such actions but I still believe in a higher power you know what I'm saying? just because it says that in the Bible to me doesn't mean so much that's a little weird I know. but I feel like the Bible can be so easily tampered with and just the feeling then there is a higher power is kind of my reassurance but yeah do not in fact condone the death of homosexual oriented people	11

1	So they're incapable of rubbing up against something to masturbate?   I mean the real intelligent design would be a system that completely prevents individuals from procreating or expressing and experiencing any sort of sexual desire or pleasure until they form a lifelong bonded pair with a member or the opposite sex.  But nope God decided to go with a messy biological system that is almost guaranteed to damn everybody to hell until someone got hammered to a piece of wood. #Thanks~~Obama~~God	11
0	You can do whatever you want... But why be a dick?  If some Muslims don't want you to make depictions of Mohammad, Then why would you do so, Other than to simply be a dick?   Furthermore, what did these people get out of provoking extremists, other than shot?  It seems to me, they got exactly what they were looking for... And I'd feel a lot more sympathy for any victims if they weren't essentially spitting in the face of the people who were doing the shooting.    Lesson: Don't be a dick and people probably won't shoot at you.	11

1	It's a matter of interpretation, but it has to do with the genre. So if you read any book in the New Testament, the intent is clearly to persuade you to believe in Jesus. But if you read the hadith, they're just basically recollections about Muhammad and his direct successors. It's not inherently religious. I mean, I can go to a church and report what they're saying - it might concern religion, but I wouldn't say that the end result will be religious.	11
0	Having sex with people of the same gender is normal nowadays. Who does it? People who are attracted to the same gender. So who would have sex with a 9-year-old girls (when he was 54) back in the day?  I rest my case.	11
1	This reminds me of the downfall of Jon Hinson, the right-wing Mississippi congressman who resigned in 1981 after being arrested for public sodomy.

Showing atheists as multidimensional helps people see there's more to it than anger and sarcasm, and that's good ... marketing.	11

1	&gt;  I'm a bit saddened by the deliberate targeted provocation, and most of us feel that way.  It's one of the natural human reactions to being oppressed by threats of violence. We challenge authorities. We especially challenge those who claim authority while not actually being authorities. I'm not quite sure what result you really expected here. Pure and complete submission by folks that aren't of the same faith? That seems a bit silly to me.	11

But why title the post "No Thanks"? It reads like you're calling incest icky. If that's your opinion that's fine, but I don't see anything inherently wrong with people who like incest. The only argument against incest is that children they have have an increased chance of genetic defects and increased vulnerability to some diseases. What if the incestious couple doesn't have children?	11
1	And therein lies one of the biggest problems with religions: They think their rules are universal. Pretty much exactly how the rules are written down to begin with -- can't see how any of this surprises anyone.

0	The fact that you say that something is not deserving of respect sickens me. You criticize religion and ostracize it when it has a clear purpose on this earth and helps some people find peace and purpose in life.

1	Yeah I'm a huge fan of the Daily Show but was pretty disappointed with that segment as well. Especially considering Jon Stewart is a self-described socialist and Senator Sanders actually had the balls to admit years ago that he's a democratic socialist in a country where "socialism" has been so stigmatized. The few times that Jon's mentioned Sanders on his show, he's made fun of his hair and not much more. I don't think he's ever been on the Daily Show. He always does great on Real Time with Bill Maher though.	11

0	Why? Is it because I have political views different than your own? I don't think /r/atheism should be a soapbox for *any* political views. We should be discussing irrational adherence to religion, myth, and superstition, not discussing abortion or other political issues. Anyone interested in submitting that content should try /r/politics instead.	11
0	What do you think? I was not trained in childhood to deal with other women in daily situations. Now I need to learn how to be a mature person by myself. Seeing people as people, regardless of tribe and gender, with lack of prejudice and temptation.  As for the rest of the people of my country, I have no idea. They are on a balance between liberalism and extremism, and it seems that we are tipping to the latter. And that would be a bad day for my country.	11

0	Except you are siding with a well documented hate group, actually two of them.  This is like promoting neo-nazis because you believe in their freedom of speech.

Right-wingers generally don't interpret climate change attribution articles with any nuance, but instead remember it as actually claiming 100% attribution.  I've seen plenty of people claim the drought/floods are consistent with and/or influenced by AGW.  I'll leave it to /u/bellcrank or /u/archiesteel or someone else to clarify on the actual consensus position on attribution here.  The problem is that people's brains aren't really built to grasp attribution this way.  We tend to think of cause and effect as all or nothing.	12

1	The [comments](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elite-pcs/the-pi-z0ne/comments) are incomprehensible. He mainly sticks to the Galileo fallacy.	12
1	Picking that point just a bit.   The term GMO is used to encompass two ideas - selective breeding and laboratory gene insertion. No one (that I'm aware of) is against selective breeding. What they're against is a gene being replaced or altered in their food. Also corporate patenting of foods, but that's a somewhat different beast to tackle.   I don't have a problem with it (go disease/drought resistance corn!) but gene replacement is usually what the public fears. Lack of understanding and all that.	12
1	Because it's cheaper than real medicine in most cases.	12

It's simple game theory that we end up with a 2-party system with exactly the results we have today, where the parties aren't really even that different except a few token meaningless issues to get people riled up.  And when the winds shift, they find new issues to argue about.	12
1	I'm wary of analogies, but that's like asking when measuring something ever built a house.  Rational inquiry is the process of medical science, medicine is the practice of the results of the process aiming at best-case treatment.   Homeopathy specifically claims to have undermined that process and found an effective practice that defies rational inquiry. If they want to live outside the realm of rational thinking, best of luck to them, but this is faulty logic to present as an argument against the role of rational inquiry in medical practice. This is "science doesn't care about you" political spin.	12

1	An insurance company exists to bring in more revenue than its costs.  Presumably, the costs of sending someone to a chiropractor is cheaper than the alternatives, and sending a patient to a chiropractor means that the patient is less likely to seek out the more expensive alternatives, then it makes sense to do so (obviously this is a simplification).  A patient may receive a nice placebo effect from a chiropractor.  If that placebo effect lasts long enough that either the patient heals on their own, or if it's cheaper than pain meds for the same duration, then to an insurance company, covering chiropractic visits is more profitable than the alternative.	12

Pretty accurate description of what most deniers have done.  A conspiracy theory always seems to crumble in pieces like this, and gets louder as the end draws near.	12

0	There was no deceptive intent by linking to the printable version of the article - my understanding is that it is generally preferred.

This is apparently a big ask for some people, but really should be the minimum for any thinking person.	12

Most of the genetic modifications mankind has made would not have happened without farmers using the seed from their best crops for their next planting. Buying seeds from a corporation is an incredibly recent development in agriculture. Even if the best seed comes in an annual shipment with the Monsanto logo on it, Monsanto does not have the right to tell anyone what can and cannot be done with the life that grows from that seed. It violates a fundamental principal without which a free society cannot exist.	12

Monsanto actually pays to have their crops removed, and will compensate the farmer for lost product if cross pollination is proven to be the culprit for the appearance of their crops.   They've also made public statements promising not to produce the Terminator genes they have created.

When cooking, boiling can cause a variety of chemical reactions based on the thermal loading and focus-point of the heat source on the cooking vessel, as well as the composition of the cooking vessel and the boiled mixture itself. Boil a soup at max heat over an hour, and you'll get plenty of chemical reactions occurring. Off the top of my head: protein denaturation, lipid peroxidation and conjugation, a variety of maillard-recombinations, and potentially caramellization and pyrolysis, depending on whether you stir the soup or not.	12

And in all these decades, with thousands of people working on all these planes in all these airports, not one single one of them decided to come forward about it, or tip off the news or anything, but somehow you know about it because you saw a vapor trail in the sky?  Come on...	12

He felt it better not to insult their intelligence for Kill Bill.

0	&gt; All weather events are affected by climate change  This is correct. Weather is just what we expect the environment to do today. Climate is what we expect it to do on average over the next several decades. So weather does not prove or disprove global warming. The proof of global warming is the direct measurement of the global temps over time.  However conservatives do not seem to understand statistics in any way. Just like the conservative mind could not understand simple statistics and thought "Unskewed Polls" was good mathematics, so also the conservative mind cannot understand that snowballs in winter do not disprove global warming.	12

0	To your first point, reducing GHG emissions usually involves replacing that energy generation with a form of energy generation that (for now), is more expensive. Hence, higher energy prices.  Second point, I was thinking along the more micro level. If a person's energy bill in the winter increases, they aren't going to consider investing more in renewables or try to rebuild our aging electricity infrastructure. They're going to do what they can, probably through finding a substitute.	12

0	How about [Harvard](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/08/reduce-type-2-diabetes-risk/) saying juice is not as good as fruit, or the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/sugar-guideline/en/) speaking out against added refined sugars, or the [Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/whole-grains/art-20047826) advocating against refined grains, the [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-21682779) reporting about how processed meats cause earlier death rates.  I mean, come on dude. GMOs aren't dangerous, and flour isn't toxic, but processed foods needing to be moderated in one's diet is old, established news. But I linked to recent corroborating stuff just to prove this isn't old, overturned news.	12

1	Really rather obvious, isn't it?	12
0	PPP is a troll polling firm, who doesn't release data if it goes against their preset ideological beliefs. How is that scientific, again?  I cited 5 cases, not "a couple". And it does demonstrate that there are major problems within the polling industry.	12
0	&gt; Seriously the shill gambit is getting a little annoying.  It's a great thought-terminating cliche: you are a shill ... ah, nice, now I don't have to critically examine my assumptions.	12
0	Since commenting earlier, I watched several of his videos. I really don't understand how people can live with so much hatred in their hearts.  On gender wage gap issue, I feel the exaggeration of the statistic is damaging.	12
1	I'm one of those ~~"on the fence"~~ people who doesn't know enough to form a real opinion on climate change yet, aside from accepting the consensus of the majority of environmental scientists as a fallback position until I know more.  In the battlefield of ideas, I'm the kind of person you should be trying to convince with your arguments. I'm ripe fruit for the picking. But posts like what you've made here (and in your posting history) honestly have the opposite effect. If you're debating in order to change minds, either change your tactics or consider taking up literal bowling as a better use of your time.	12
0	&gt; Also, nobody is going to debunk what is so obviously not a nuclear detonation.  This circular reasoning, and absence of properly explicitated analysis - arguments -, is not up to a skeptical standard methodology.	12
1	I'm the guy that puts all the dummies in the plane that are sitting on the chemical tanks. I pose them to look like they are realistically frozen in one motion for the entire flight, as to trick all the super sleuths with YouTube channels. Somehow they keep seeing through our bulletproof ruse. Anyway, I was talking to the guy who dresses the dummies, and we were attaboy-ing each other on being two links in a chain that never discloses any of this information, especially on the internet. None of you will ever find out we've done this.	12

1	I can see gerrymandering increasing the problem and I kind of wish that we had a system like the UK where they outsource redistricting to a neutral third party to promote competitive elections.     I've been trying to get through this biography of Reagan and his apparent fascination with meat is kind of disturbing.	12
0	Oh yes. Every time this comes up in a default sub, the brogressives come out of the woodwork.  Certain classes are at higher risk than others, but it's **only with gay people** that we discriminate along class lines.	12
1	Yeah it should have been in /r/science  This was verified a while back by the boy that went to heaven.	12
1	Oh, well that makes him much more credible. He probably should have lead with that.	12
0	What do you think OP and /r/skeptic:  A) Should lukewarmers be rejected outright as deniers in disguise?  Or   B) Should lukewarmers be embraced and welcomed into the discussion on climate mitigation/adaptation policies?	12
1	Haha, I know the senate is powerful but I don't think they get to vote on what's real or not.  I bet climate change will work the same way regardless of what they say.	12
0	I answered the point, explicitly, you're just digging your denialist heels in and refusing to face that. Have fun with your 'hah we're so smrt' circlejerk against people who actually rely on facts and evidence over 'fun' narratives. Why are you even in a skeptic subreddit?	12
0	If you had clear cut examples of the type of damage you pointed to: "storm damage" and "coastal erosion", you would have already post them. But I am betting that you don't. Looks like its paying off for me...	12
0	Oh come on. You're making an emotional argument and trying to turn a scientific issue into a race/class issue.   Most Westerners who oppose GMO's (or just want labeling) do so in their own country (Americans in the USA, Canadians in Canada, etc.) where it will have no effect on people in other countries. Also, there are anti GMO groups in poor countries (I recall seeing a video of Filipinos destroying GMO crops in the Philippines a year or 2 ago).	12

0	Read This ---- http://www.rodalenews.com/facts-about-flame-retardants	12
1	I think the idea is that what they ate must be "what we evolved to eat." Never mind that humans have continued evolving since the paleolithic period, and never mind the fact that the diet of paleolithic peoples in the Iberian Peninsula would likely bear little resemblance to the diet of those in sub-Saharan Africa or southeast Asia. A lot of the rationale is based on studies of current non-industrialized people groups finding lower rates of things like heart disease and cancer among those people, but the evidence and reasoning there are pretty iffy.	12
0	I'll agree to that.  Most companies just didn't want the expense of sourcing and the stigma associated with GM labeling against fickle rules - but hey, why not go full bore and list all the sources and GM connections, with no exceptions?  And while we're at it, pesticide use.  Note the names and use per gram of product for each pesticide involved in its production - even for processed goods.  Aggregates are ok.	12
1	But isn't it completely fucking galling how *rich* he is compared to the average (intelligent, rational, multi-brain-celled) scientist?  It's almost enough to make you abandon your principles and give up, and just take the woo-woo dollar. Like tossing aside a career as a human rights lawyer to become Judge Judy.  I don't know, I just get depressed by people like him, and the masses and masses of people who lap it up and lavish money on it.	12

0	I evaluate opinions based on the evidence, logic and reason put into that opinion, not based on who's opinion it is, or what their opinions are on other related subjects.  It's certainly harder than dividing people into groups where you'll uncritically accept or dismiss anything they say, but it enables one to develop a more nuanced and intelligent opinion.  But this isn't about me.  Its about a new paper by Lewandowsky.  Do you have anything to say about that?	12
0	Well, the goal of deductive tasting is to decide on the wine's condition, faults (if any) and so on but also the varietal, age and region. If you know a bit about wine then the latter is much easier using visual information as well.   It isn't that it can't be done without looking but just that one might as well use all the information possible.	12

1	I'm not a scientist. But from the articles I read, "fixing it" is kinda off the table. Now it's more of a "managing it" or "surviving it" kind of thing.	12
0	No. you're arguing against physics. You're arguing that a cld object radiates as energetically as a warm one. And in defending that ridiculous idea you've been monkey-typing (monkeys typing long enough reproduce Shakespeare) in hopes of something of value emerging.   I call people kid when they prove to have the abilities of a child and rant like a child.	12
1	And when nothing happens, these same people will tout their victory cries over how their standing up against this BS made the evil liberal controlled government stand down and cower in fear of the conservative "true" Americans.

1	The author of this article is a climate change and ozone depletion denialist.  Doesn't invalidate what he writes, but I thought it's worth mentioning.  [Ronald Bailey: Global Warming and Other Eco Myths](http://www.amazon.com/Global-Warming-Other-Myths-Environmental/dp/0761536604)  He's very selective about which scientific consensus he accepts and which not.	12

0	I don't agree, I don't like mayonnaise and it's not because I'm not used to it.   As far as sugar goes, it's historically extremely successful. Plants use it to get us to shit out their seeds, our bodies know it to taste good, and companies use it to get us to buy their bullshits. Sugar owns bones, sorry.	12
0	&gt; The graph you initially gave was for the entire globe  Yes, and only morons can't see that the 50+ year trend is quite similar.  &gt; That won't change the level of the 1998, 2010 and 2015 peaks.  Right, since only moronic AGW-deniers would believe those specific 3 peaks are not all much higher as a result of AGW.	12

0	You can call it spineless, but really, it's a smart move.  Standing up to them gains nothing and risks alienating them.  Appeasing them with an action that really does nothing doesn't really hurt anything and keeps the support.  Politics is more rational than you think, when you realize the game is being played.	12

0	How is this a skeptical opinion? It is just speculation. It's all right to have opinions -- I actually agree with you -- but that's all it is. I think what OP is looking for, and deserves, is a scientific explanation of how people can be fooled into thinking that they've been abducted, seen UFOs, etc.	12
1	I appreciate the donotlink-style links to undercut the value of exposure for crank sites.

You'll always have fake skeptics submitting sincere links to garbage.	12

1	There's likely no "study" for the claim. However, vaccination is at the core of immunology so finding professionals in the field rejecting the efficacy of vaccination echoes the rare biologists that reject evolution. It is a foundational block that our knowledge revolves around and rejecting it seems very delusional to do from a professional perspective.	12

0	That's ok. I found it amusing enough to post so I'll take my medicine. The science is interesting, the coincidence of name along with the subject/title (which lit every woo detector I had before I read the article) is unusual and it does show you need to read things deeper than just the title.  It may also be a concept distorted and promoted by magnet crazies in the future so /r/skeptic could benefit from knowing about it.	12

1	But the trend of moving towards organics will result in shortages as the global population is continuing to grow. Even if currently there are improvements to be made in distribution, it does not mean adopting organic growing is a good step forward.  There is a fictional "good old days" mentality among those with liberal leanings that is very much similar to conservatives. The main difference is rather than a good old fashion values, it's quality food prior to industrialization and a connection to nature. /u/mem_somerville recently linked an [excellent article thoroughly  debunking it](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/371mha/a_plea_for_culinary_modernism_great_debunking_of/).	12

We're supposed to judge the validity of our reasoning and facts used to reach conclusions so if I reach a certain ethical position then I need to be able to skeptical assess it.   I can see why *scientific* skepticism wouldn't be much help but there's no reason to limit skepticism to that.	12

Reality is that religion has a bad observable history with science, and there are measurably different outcomes for religiosity and science (even when atheists make up almost none of the population, they make up nearly all of the accomplishments in science). I mean how many excuses do you people need to give to hide yourselves from this obvious truth?	12

He will not have the support of the national party and will not get past the early primary states.	12
0	You analogy isn't great. Doctors are supposed to be the medical experts and the authority we defer to for healthcare needs. It would be more like if some conservative think tank said smoking isn't bad for you and people took that at face value.  Similarly, scientists are experts in their respective fields, such as vaccines, global warming, and GMO's.   Really, no government or anyone else should trust a non scientist (or someone who doesn't cite scientists) on a scientific topic.	12

1	Some days I'm actually relieved that other scientists in my twitter feed have to deal with the drama of the day. There was a collective head-desk when that started going around. For anyone else battling this, see Phil.

1	&gt;Why, is there something wrong with gawker?  Some of their blogs are a bit crap, but some of them are pretty good. And of course, a good article is a good article, regardless of the blog title or masthead.  It's just a combination of two things - Reddit's hatred of Gawker because Gawker criticised reddit and Reddit's endless willingness to circlejerk about how terrible anyone they don't like is regardless of evidence.	12

0	good explanation.  Here is my problem. I like reality. I like it when things are described as they are, not as we would like them to be or how we feel it would be a good idea to describe them to get a certain effect in the people we describe it to.   So if it is harmless (which it is) it makes sense to me to describe it that way.	12
0	I agree that the terminology that is used by the media can have an effect on how much credibility I will actually give them in the reporting.  It's so frustrating when I hear slang used by the media when they report about officer involved shootings.  like when they use the term bad guy instead of subject. or they use the term take down instead of arrest. It makes me think I'm watching a WWE match rather than an objective journalistic report.	12
1	I was thinking about this the other day; If they wanted to call their ingredients "food with integrity", then shouldn't they be informing the ill-informed rather than pandering to them?  Wouldn't that be the integrous thing to do?	12

It's pretty heartbreaking to read about how Amanda watched the show and lost a lot of hope when Sylvia lied.	12
0	So your solution is skip the social, psychological, educational aspects, etc... of eating and just tell people not to eat too much. So, basically the republican senator approach to problems. You get to sound right without actually fixing a problem in a way to helps people, you know, fix a problem.	12
1	Do you consider Richard Betts and "And Then There's Physics" to be legitimate, authoritative sources? Because if you do then you have to admit you've been wrong on the science all these years, and you have so serious apologizing to do. If not, then you're simply cherry-picking, and revealing yourself to be a hypocrite. Which is it?	12
0	The feminist would respond that the system is designed for men to make more money. That if raises are given out to people that are more likely to ask for them (men) the system is biased towards men making more money. What about a system where raises are given regularly and based on performance review rather than given out to those who ask for them?  I don't know.	12
0	Neither, I'm just interested in seeing good quality, on-topic content posted to this subreddit and to fairly present both sides of an issue, and let people come to their own conclusions.	12

1	Of course a less-sophisticated population can be tricked into believing incorrect things, since environmentalists put their efforts into deceiving them.  &gt; It is the poor farmers who are rejecting this rice.  It isn't poor local farmers vandalizing test fields, or lobbying to prevent governmental approval. GR is failing because environmentalists are working to block it, not because of a lack of farmer enthusiasm or because farmers have been tricked into believing environmentalist conspiracy theories.	12
1	I worry a lot more about the old pipes in my apartment building than about what the city is doing to the water before it gets to me. And the water definitely tastes different out of the tap regardless of whether there is a filter or not - as compared to the water I get for drinking from the water store (at $0.25 per gallon). It's similar to the water dispensing machines you see out in front of some grocery stores.  Might just be that I was raised on that sort of water, but I just can't drink from the tap.	12

0	If I was a big organic shill I wouldn't want you growing your own organic produce as that would cut into my profits, now wouldn't it?  And I certainly wouldn't say: I say grow your own if you can because I am aware that organic isn't perfect.  But when it comes to the production of food on an industrial scale so that people can buy it at their local Wal Mart, organic is far and away superior to conventional industrial food production in terms of health for the consumer, farm workers, people living near farms, and the environment.	12
0	I'll be upfront and say I don't know if this is appropriate for this subreddit.  We talk about trolls, and what is or is not trolling, a lot here, (*or maybe it just seems that way to me because I'm the one who's always accused of being a troll.*)  I just thought it was an absolutely fascinating article, and since many proponents of things we're skeptical of are accused of being trolls, it might be close enough to warrant inclusion here.	12
0	Honesty in labeling is a pretty easy, yet important job of government yet according to this post good skeptics want to be kept in the dark about the source and type of their food.  I completely fail to see how that could be a "skeptics" position.  If anything it reeks of blind trust of the regulatory agencies.	12
1	100% organic, no pesticides or herbicides used.	12
1	Well this essentially has all of the right places to search under one roof.  Rather than telling a friend to google it they can debunkle it. I know this works because when you tell someone to search: "Portuguese pyramid" on google the top results are always the sites spreading the BS to begin with. On Debunkle only credible sites are indexed and the person is only likely to come up wit the correct answers.  I came up with the idea as an opposition to Natural News's (Alternative News" search engine which only searches crackpot news sites to get "real news"	12
1	I'm going to upvote you in the hope people don't realise I have no idea what you said.	12

0	Philosophy is still limited to *a priori* and *a posteriori* methods, which limits it to non-falsifiable conclusions. Once it makes a falsifiable statement, it evolves into actual Science, which is axiomatic based on the execution of the Scientific Method. But I don't actually hold any opinions on that matter of fact, to be honest. Sorry for the confusion.	12

1	...except in people with PKU, right?  :I	12
0	They're philosophical issues until the proper scientific framework is constructed around them. Philosophy and science are not peers. Philosophy is *a priori* and *a posteriori* reasoning, or what you do till science takes over. It's important in the early stages of inquiry, before you know how to ask the right questions, or what the right questions even are, or what proper range of questions exist in ideaspace. Then philosophy steps back and works on something else as science takes over the heavy lifting.	12
1	pretty sure these are legit depending on the type of color blindness	12
1	They're all mostly harmless myths except the sports drinks. They are probably useless or even counter-productive for 99% of the people who drink them. Plain old water would be better, and the extra salt and sugar are almost always unnecessary. One of my pet peeves is seeing people refer to it as "fuel". Usually it's just in ads, but occasionally it seeps over into real life.	12

1	I unfollowed I Fucking Love Science. Every now and then they would post a very off base article, give a misleading or spruced up title for views and or to inflate their view count.

1	Pride but also you count towards the national vote figure and in this country's case help make the case stringer for electoral reform. If you hide your voice in a tactical vote then that message gets lost.	14
0	If you are talking about that prison policy, don't expect me to defend it because I don't support it - like many other members of the party which is why it will be discussed and probably voted out during the next Party conference in September, based on the large amount of criticism I've seen WITHIN the party.	14

0	Woah hold on a minute people. Did we all get out the wrong side of bed this morning or something?  The point is that we didn't really have much say in electing these people in Brussels.  We have the same argument closer to home at the moment with people saying we need electoral reform... because we have leaders that a lot of people didn't vote for.   Why are we defending the EU system on the one hand but wanting to change the UK system on the other?	14

1	And there we have it, the other shoe drops. South Yorkshire police have been absolutely abysmal on dealing with CSE, threatened the [central government researcher  in 2002](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/09/researcher-rotherham-abuse-feared-for-life-police-visit), and consistently failed to act when information was passed to them. [Even when Sheffield council begged them to act](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31859931), and gave them funding for the investigation, they managed to do nothing meaningful.  Because they were riddled with abusers themselves.	14

0	Why is it that only white countries have cultural cringe, even countries like Ireland (Boston doesn't count) with no history of colonialism or slavery?   Two possible reasons A: Self-deprecation is racially determined by being white  or B: Since the early 20th century groups have been going into the media and universities of those countries and telling people to think nationalism is tacky and racist and to link their whiteness with oppression.	14
1	It's quite nice, every now and then someone who agress with Richard Littlejohn will read a title like this and think "Hang on, maybe we're *not* the good guys". Not often, but sometimes. Let's face it, no one is going to read that and go "Oh yes, quite a compelling argument, I'm convinced".	14

0	I mean I can't be bothered looking it up when it's already been on the front page, mentioned in all the leadership debates. I'm pretty sure I could easily find sources with google, but it gets tedious when every time you say something, rather than them actually find a source refuting you, post a single word "Source?". I'll tell you what, if you find a source refuting me, and an alternative as to why the NHS is over budget. I'll go to the effort and find a credible source or 12.	14
0	It's completely different to our system. Cameron wasn't selected after the election. People knew what they were getting.	14
1	All speculation, but fun and somewhat plausible speculation at that. I think a lot of people underestimate Miliband's ability to break with convention, and the promise for a constitutional convention in the Labour manifesto is an immensely exciting wildcard. It could mean...well...literally anything, at this point.	14
1	I would support this.	14
1	How many 18 year olds have a clue what they're talking about?	14
1	Its a bit late for Labour to start pointing out that it was a global recession. They have allowed the Tories (and Lib Dems) to endlessly repeat that Labour caused the recession, to the extent that much of the electorate probably accepts it as fact.	14
1	Maybe the sky won't fall if the SNP get into government after all.	14
0	I'm not really sure its a *problem* with QT audiences. If anything I think its a good thing that our representatives have such direct contact with the public. The fact is that tory activist or not, there will have been a lot of people that would have wanted to pose the same question to Ed, and he should really be able to answer it satisfactorily.	14
1	So again, what do you think the question should be?	14
0	He should still be suspended though, even though most Jews are probably more loyal to Israel than their host nation, it's unprofessional to point out these stereotypes, even if there's some truth to them.  Also, I think it's unfair to suggest Miliband is more loyal to Israel as he opposed intervention in Syria and that's something Israel *really* wanted. I think Miliband fits the Bolshevik/Communist Jewish stereotype better tbh, but that would be unprofessional to point out too.	14
1	It's in their manifesto...	14
0	&gt;Ms Berger - who has campaigned against internet "trolls" after one who abused her online ***was jailed*** - told Jewish News it was "clearly an anti-Semitic comment".  Wow, free speech is truly dead	14

1	&gt; The Standard is good for a free newspaper and at least occasionally tries to present a range of political voices.  It's been a Tory rag for weeks to the point where I can't even read it anymore.   Couple weeks ago their front page splash was "Miliband weaponises drowning migrants".	14

1	Was he that fat that you coulnd't possibly walk around him? Do you feel intimidated when "asian blokes" make eye contact with you?  He's not doing anything wrong. There's a LibDem guy outside my polling station doing exactly the same thing.	14
1	&gt; if they do not affect Scotland.  Dat clickbait. The SNP already don't vote on English only issues. The reason there are so few of these is because the English budget affects the Scottish budget in most areas.	14

0	The iPlayer isn't illegal.  The license covers TV programs being broadcast. I can watch as much catch-up TV as I like - even on a TV - without legally having to pay a single penny.

Edit: it appears I was thinking one type of PR was called PR and the others systems were called other things. Either way, you still lose local representation in more sparsely populated areas.	14
1	UKIP: how they're burying their heads in the sand over the environment (aside from opposing HS2).	14
1	It's sometimes an incentive.  In some states in the US, they implemented the death penalty for violent rapes.  This resulted in an uptake of murder in rape cases, as there was no differentiation in punishment between them and *not* killing the victim led to increased risk of being caught.	14

1	I don't get upset by such questions. I'm glad there are people who don't understand what I'm going through, because no-one should go through this shit. I don't berate, I simply answer because that way people's opinions change.  You're right it is indicative of the problem, but I think by explaining why that reasoning is wrong rather than reacting badly to the question, we can change more minds. (Or at least I hope so anyway).	14

1	I want to see an agreement between UKIP, the lib dems and the greens to crush FPTP, it can't be done without a united coalition.  I'd also want the SNP in but seen as they benefit so much from it they won't be as compelled as other parties.	14

1	It's obvious he's an economically illiterate, naive ideologue with a wardrobe full of Ché t-shirts and when he said he had never voted before, it's clear he wasn't lying. He is exactly like an 18 year old who has never been disappointed after voting Labour before and learned their lesson.   Russell, the bankers and all the corporations you hate so much absolutely looooove immigration. That's why it happens. They profit from the increased housing prices, increased demand on resources and all the rest. You are are a useful idiot to them.	14
1	"Focused on age 15 to age 21, age 22 to age 24 and age 25 to age 40"  So... focused on age 15 to 40?  And the Conservative guy's response beggars belief. "What's an interesting fact about you?" "Well, I'm not a racist, for one thing."	14
1	I was going to vote Green in a Lab/Con battleground, till the Murdoch medica stepped up their hateful and disgraceful propaganda machine to discredit Labour.  Then it all came back to me - Rebekah Brooks, the News of the world phone hacking scandal, Andy Coulson, the foodbanks, Cameron's pathetic plea to attack Syria, the Murdoch media's frightening grip on British politics. Also turns out my local Tory MP is a part-timer who's been on a missing persons list of 5 years.  Voted Labour, not thrilled about it, but if it prevents another 5 years of the Bullingdon bullies, I'm game.	14

1	No, the Guardian is a liberal newspaper.   http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/the-scott-trust/  People make the mistake in thinking that because Polly Toynbee and Owen Jones writes for the Guardian, it must be a leftist- or Labour outlet. It really isn't. "Comment is Free" harbour everyone from Chris Huhne to Matthew D'Ancoma to Owen Jones. One can't really accuse Matthew D'Ancona of being down the the SWP much.	14
1	&gt; an elected House of Lords  Are they pretending they are going to do that again? They were pretending that when I was a teenager, when the now 'Lord' Kinnock made passionate speeches about doing so...	14
1	I was going to vote Conservative because I think they will manage the economy better. However I disagree with the election bribery:  * Subsidies for buying houses - right to buy, home buying ISAs. I prefer they build more houses. * Subsidies for London commuters. Why would you do that? * Five year tax freezes. This is just irresponsible and could be a disaster in some circumstances.	14
1	Quite.  The standard is a decent read, but full of stories of their posh mates turning up at posh clubs in pretty dresses as if anyone would give a shit, and columnists with triple barreled surnames waffling about lunch in primrose hill.  All the things they talk about would only benefit the very rich. They can fuck off.	14
0	I am, but a lot of UKIP voters chose to ignore this and fail to question it.	14
0	But a government decided under PR is the one that isn't representational. Currently MPs are there to represent the constituency that they were elected in. If ukip get only 10% of the vote why one earth should they have a single MP in Parliament? They have not been chosen by the people, they have voted in somebody else who they belive will best represent their needs.	14
1	&gt;Nobody argues that Labour caused the crash  Clearly you missed that bellend in the Question Time audience. Although he may just have been in denial because he works in the financial sector, it's still true that at least one person thinks Labour caused the crash.	14
1	You have to give him credit for actually apologising, its a very rare thing in politics	14
1	Clearly Labour strategists were hard at work to come up with something dumber than the Tories plan from last week to pass a law to stop themselves doing something.  I think they cracked it. Well done guys.	14
0	Ok well my 'political opinion' is that I think we should have a set of values whereby having kids at age 15 and 16 is frowned upon rather than being the norm. I'd give them nothing, no benefits, no fuck all. You made your bed and you lay in it....with someone else ....hence your messed up situation.   I would make their families pay the bill for their irresponsible behaviour and I certainly wouldn't have the Jeremy Kyle generation anywhere near a ballot box.   That better?	14
0	&gt;I'm sorry, how old are you?  I'm 12 obviously. A tiny child eclipsed by the shadow of your looming intellect. I pray you do not choose to smite me while I cower in its withering shade.  It was just a harmless gibe matey. Much like /u/Xordamond's. Don't start lactating with rage.	14
1	They took the Scottish Labour voters for granted for too long. They were seen to align themselves and share platforms with the much hated Tories during the independence campaign.  Also, the Scots kept voting for left wing government but kept getting almost perpetual right wing government led by Thatcher, Major, Blair and Cameron. After more than 30 years of it they got a bit fed up.	14
0	You know UKIP want to scrap inheritance tax altogether??	14
1	That's a really good point. It annoys me as I feel a Lib-Lab coalition would be a decent result. You're right though, he does seem to be cosying up to Cameron much more, even though his manifesto arguably has more in common with Labour.	14
0	East Hamspire, crikey, thats going to be a tough one. Best of luck to you anyway mate!	14
0	I think you need to learn to read. Cameron has never had two head to head debates with Miliband - he's only had one. Debates obviously do matter to you because you kept bringing them up and referring to them in your original comment!	14

0	&gt; Because we as a society (in general) believe people shouldn't be persecution on the basis of faith, ethnicity of gender.  Logic is flawed. The very thing you claim to be against, you are for. This law means for example that every Christian, Sikh and Hindu in this country is now viewed as a lesser being in terms of hate discrimination legislation.	14
1	Depends on the context. As a student, I don't especially feel comfortable telling my friends that I'm considering voting Tory or Lib Dem. Seems like I'm expected to have an inflated sense of "morality" and should vote Labour or Green.  EDIT: In general, I'd say the negative view of right-wingers is worse than left-wingers. Tories are seen as heartless/evil/immoral, while Labour are seen as naive/wasteful.	14
1	I didn't. I suck.	14
1	I'd gladly pay a little more tax if it means helping those who need it, or, having a better social net if I ever lose my job / become disabled.   All these cuts amount to next to no money in the big scheme of things, which is the sad thing.	14

Parliament will also be completely and utterly crippled and we'll have a situation like Belgium which had no government for ages.	14
1	Anything involving a suit and the city is a banker to some people.	14
0	You may believe that, but that doesn't mean that there is good reason to trust Labour again.  Personally, I don't think the Tories would have borrowed as much as Labour.	14

1	It's not just 'proper form'. Even though parliament has been dissolved, the Prime Minister remains in place until he/she resigns.

1	No permanent at sea deterrent- four subs means one is at sea at all times.

You shouldn't be shocked, over [10,000 people assessed as fit to work by ATOS died within six weeks of assessment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Capability_Assessment#Dangerous_conclusions_and_deaths)   Yes, there needs to be a system to assess disability and ensure that people who need help receive it, and people that can work, do work. But under Iain Duncan-Smith, the process has been made less accountable, less objective, more led by arbitrary targets aimed at getting as many people off benefits as possible, regardless of the consequences.	14

1	It says a lot for representation in politics though. Call it an oligopoly rather than an aristocracy if you will, it might be 'the very best education' but to a large degree it homogenizes the life experience of those who represent us. Let's not pretend that Eton, Oxbridge and the like don't confer a disproportionately high career advantage and that this prestige doesn't go much further than simply the quality of their teaching.	14
1	Bringing a party whose main goal is the break up of the United Kingdom into government is seen as political suicide. How can a party claim to represent the UK when they give governing power to a party who wants to destroy it?	14
0	No but when the far right and the far left can pretty much be considered the same thing why is it fair to blame one side?	14
1	No we aren't.  We aren't responsible for people within our borders without our consent.  We are only responsible for their safe protection until they can be removed.	14
0	I don't really see what relevance your questions have. They seem to be the absolute MINIMUM required by a political party. What OP is asking is the specifics of why Labour is not considering a coalition with the SNP. Saying "they are a legitimate party" is not enough.	14
1	So the Scottish people will have basically ended up voting in a Tory government? Well done pals.	14

0	The Tories are guilty of it too but that was mostly several decades ago. The stigma around revealing abuse has changed since that time. The fact that Muslim gangs were raping girls in their *thousands* up to 2015 is a lot worse than some isolated cases in the 1970's.	14

1	I'm pretty sure it's positive towards all parties except the Conservatives (including a very vocal right wing contingent in support of UKIP). Why are there no Tories here? No idea, but seeing as the UKIP guys are somewhat kindred spirits I don't think it's because they've been bullied out with downvotes.  Probably a more fundamental question about where the hell all the Conservatives' supporters actually are in general. I'm in a key Lab Con marginal swing seat, and I've not seen a single one of the blighters out campaigning yet.	14
1	&gt; So how can they possibly have the interests of the whole UK at heart?  They have the interests of the UK citizens who voted for them to represent them in the UK parliament at heart. No more or less than any other MP in Westminster.	14
1	The SNP have said that they would vote on English issues now though haven't they? Saying that they still affect Scotland or something.	14
1	Why? Do you think Faslane would be top target for enemy nukes? It's a submarine based launched system, they would target cities and military installations as well, that 100 mile radius is probably in range of other military complexes.	14

0	In all fairness, no other party has yet proposed a policy which would cost people in the UK around £950bn (the rough cost of replacing all the cars in the UK, as the proposed ban on cars capable of exceding 70mph would require)  Also, I've never seen an environmentalist party advocate a policy which involves the production of an extra 595 million tons of CO2, as would be emitted in replacing all those cars. That one policy would cause more CO2 production than the UK as a whole currently puts out in a year.	14
1	That is not the point. It is the fact that Labour have even proposed it that is concerning.	14
0	Yeah, I agree. Being pro-europe doesn't seem to be a popular stance though. People take it for granted.	14
0	This is why PR is so great - it makes it much easier for new parties (like [STEP](http://step.party/policies) for instance) to be created. If the Labour Party you always wanted doesn't exist, a group of people can create it and it can actually get represented!	14
0	I know lots of people are freaking out, but don't worry here is some reasons why this is a good idea.   Firstly - Pooling of forces means we can spend less while maintaining a bigger force.   Secondly - NATO future is in question, the US is slowly pulling out of Europe and its time we had our own security force.   Thirdly - Getting of US shadow while having a suitable defense force.   I reckon that if there was a EU army it would be similar to how Nato is constructed where its more of a defense pact rather then actual one single army.   Finally this is the Daily mail... this could literally all be made up.	14
0	How do we choose a new system?  Vote?	14
1	It *could* happen here, even under FPTP. We just have to vote.  Also, it's very unlikely we'll get PR without voting PR-friendly MPs into office under the FPTP system.  That's why it's important to vote for *only* those parties that want electoral reform.	14

If people are not deceived the don't knows/undecided along with those swinging from side to side would vote for just trade. So many people have fallen for the line of renegotiation.

0	Hate to say it but you've succumbed to the media rhetoric regarding the tory pledge on tax increases. The bill is not about forcing the government to make good on its tax promises.   It is about stability - the knowledge that for the next five years there will not be tax increases on basic income. Its actually a very clever piece of legislation for giving the British public a sense of stability and continuity and there are a number of knock-on economic benefits.   But of course its been falsely portrayed as evidence that politicians don't even trust themselves to make good on their promises.	14

1	Proportional Representation is a class of electoral systems, and some of those systems allow for a local MP still. With [mixed member proportional representation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT0I-sdoSXU&amp;list=PL7679C7ACE93A5638&amp;index=4) citizenry can still elect a local candidate.  In the Scottish Parliament they already use this system, with citizens electing a constituency MP under FPTP and a regional MP (or list MP) under proportional representation	14

0	I think this is being posted more as an "other side of the coin". It makes Farage's complaint seem very petty. Especially as Miliband hasn't complained at this to my knowledge.   Politicians get hostile audiences, and some people might ask them awkward questions. They need to deal with that.	14
0	Possibly, but others might be underestimating just how much the SNP wants a yes vote on the next referendum, and how wary Labour might be of being a minority government with less votes and seats than the Tories in a coalition with the SNP, Greens and Plaid.	14
1	If this gets passed it's ridiculous. Our Free Speech laws are currently sufficient; if anyone uses freedom of expression to incite harm to another person or group then they are in violation of the law.   Otherwise, all this law seems likely to achieve is an authoritarian clamp down on freedom of expression.	14
1	It does.   80 grand is 80 grand. Just because you pay it off in drips and drabs doesn't mean it's not a large amount of cash that adds up to be a pretty large drain. Saying "it's a hundred quid a month" ignores the fact that 80 grand's the cost of a rather flash car or a sizeable chunk of a mortgage.   And note this is for a group of people who run the NHS and whose salaries haven't seen rises for inflation.	14
1	Ha ha ha, Jesus. UKIP Scotland fail to live up to even the rather low standard set by UKIP. What a fucking joke of a party they are up here.	14
0	&gt; I believe that people don't need to be told how to behave in this country to make a fair society.  Do you think society was fairer before things like gender and racial equality legislation and the LGBT rights movement?	14
1	&gt; You clearly have to assess people who are going to be claiming money from the state for disability, I'm interested as to how you think this could be best achieved? &gt;   Why? Isn't the most qualified and best informed professional to make this decision the claimant's GP?  &gt; Also if you dont mind disclosing, what is your condition? I find it pretty shocking that ATOS would claim you are fit for work if your prognosis is not to live past 35...  Why would you find this shocking? Numerous failed claimants don't live to see the end of their appeals.	14

0	Are you suggesting ethnic minorities would vote UKIP if only Labour didn't write instructions in Urdu? Or that the Conservatives who have little in the way of policy towards poorer people would suddenly have more poorer people vote for the cuts of their benefits?   Are you seriously suggesting that minorities vote for labour because thy are the only people who thought of using Arabic? You must be daft, Labour get votes for them because they aren't a far right party.	14

1	My perception is that ukipers are more active commenters on this sub. I have 0 data to back that up though as I really don't care enough to research it. I'm very loosely a green supporter so I'm part of the skew according to these results.	14
1	It's nice to see that it isn't only left wing people being planted in the question time audience for a change.	14
1	&gt; This is, quite frankly, a ridiculous view. Who are you even talking about here?  I'm talking about radical left, UAF types. But even a typical moderate non-politically active person can be a bit over vocal with political correctness sometimes. For example it's socially acceptable to openly support the Green party but if you support UKIP you are a Daily Mail reading racist in a lot of people's eyes.	14

0	The user did NOT ask anyone to brigade the sub. They don't link to any thread other than the one where their comment was removed and only linked to that removed comment with an np link. The thread was a few days old at that point so brigading was futile and this was not the motive of the user. They were posting on a subreddit dedicated to documenting the censorship on reddit. How can you accuse them brigading? Here is their thread:    http://np.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/34lwpa/rukpolitics_remove_comment_criticising_islam_in_a/  Were you told, you would be expected to censor criticism of Islam and would you censor someone for describing Islam in the manner which the user was censored for?	14
0	Sorry love, I've read the UKIP manifesto and I still don't like the party.  Also 'UKIP can't be racist, they have ethnic minority candidates' = 'I'm not racist, I have a black friend!'	14
1	This guy... If Lord Ashdown were still the Lib Dem leader I may very well have voted for them.	14
0	Do we want to be outside of the EU looking at essentially some sort of joint French and German army. Or do we want to remain in, and maintain the balance of power, our strategy for hundreds of years. It's only because we've totally disengaged that these mad ideas are getting any traction.   Edit - I wonder if I'm getting downvotes from pro-EU Army types, or just Eurosceptics.  Strange days indeed.	14
1	I hope you live long enough to see it. The left as always thinking it can keep the rather nice building while kicking out the bricks at the bottom that they're not too fond of.	14

1	Indeed, he does display the mentality of a child much of the time.  That worked well for him in comedy, but in politics it's pitiful.  Having Brand endorse you is not a complement, imo.	14
0	&gt;keep the rather nice building while kicking out the bricks at the bottom that they're not too fond of.  In what way is that different to what UKIP want to do?	14
1	This pretty much confirms what I thought. The subreddit is pretty balanced, with a major skew toward the non-major parties. The reason people think it's a "circlejerk" is because people downvote way too readily, and with disproportionate numbers of supporters for UKIP that means large numbers of downvotes for those who disagree with UKIP (and Greens of course, but we have more UKIP supporters).	14
1	Why don't you two just swap houses? ;-)	14
0	You speak as if human rights is something out there, which all people on Earth conclusively agree on.  But that is nor true. What is or is not 'human rights' is ultimately arbitrary, and is something which many people and nations disagree about.	14
1	Then our democracy gets a little bit better.	14
1	What an absolute dickhead. I despise the labour party because of Iraq, but we live in a democracy and I wouldn't dream of doing this to a bunch of labour party activists.	14
0	It isn't as valid though. That's what I'm trying to get through to you. Simply holding an opinion doesn't make it as valid as anyone elses.  Person A: Stars are balls of gas burning billions of miles away  Person B: Stars are fireflies that got stuck on a black carpet around the Earth  These opinions are not equally valid. Simply positing two ideas does not make them equal.	14
0	Interesting.  What dramatic changes have there been in the last 3 and a half years to make it irrelevant?	14
1	&gt;You can't ban ignorance.  Not liking Islam = ignorance?  &gt;I'd hope this means radically reforming how the country creates more opportunity for integration throughout society, economy and political discourse, and stops favouring one church over another and instead actually lives up to a secular standard.  Sounds like social engineering to me. Labour love a bit of that.	14
0	How indeed. For starters, I'd argue that we need to become more inclusive. I saw a great comment from someone from the states on here, talking about the melting-pot. I think we need to accept that's what we are too.  Edit: here come the downkips. Almost pointless trying to discuss this seriously, but thanks for trying Ivashkin.	14
0	Indeed, he's the sort of person you can reasonably disagree with over Europe. I don't know if UKIP would do better electorally under his leadership but they would certainly be more respectable.	14
0	Well no, calling Brand a joke is far to kind, but I understand Cameron has to be politically correct.	14

1	There are some famous Tory rebels who vote according to their beliefs rather than the party line (Rees-Mogg and Bone come to mind), while David Davis gave a by-election to raise the issue of civil liberties. I would also argue that Douglas Carswell's decision to run a by-election after crossing the floor, something that convention didn't dictate that he do, showed a reasonable level of integrity.	14

0	I can understand it's appeal but the glaring flaws in right wing political systems seem so obvious to me. Kaynesian economics is the only system that seems to work and even then it doesn't work in a closed system. Don't presume I don't understand right-wing philosophy just because I reject it. It has fundamental flaws that render the details moot.	14
1	Given that we have a thread on this issue every day, I'd say the answer is yes.  EDIT: In days gone by, the merit of FPTP was that it led to strong, majority governments. That's no longer the case, so FPTP has lost its appeal for me. I think coalitions and influential minor parties are what politics really needs in this country.	14
1	He is unlikely to be right. Why do politicians make these  rash predictions?   Jim Murphy has previously predicted that Labour will not lose a single seat in Scotland :O and Michael Gove today said that the Tories will win more seats than Labour........in Scotland!  it just makes them look foolish  if they are wrong,  and there must be little benefit in 'talking up' their support. Daft.	14
0	&gt;Why would you want mass immigration?  Mainly to dilute the chances of meeting a UKIP supporter, they tend to be arseholes	14
1	Has that got something to do with the sheer quantity? I mean, some of them are *bound* to happen quickly if there are so many?	14
0	Well, the part about us not being invaded is completely true. The second part about us being threatened  is just a 'worst case scenario', i don't really think that the second we remove trident we will lose all power internationally.	14
1	Reading between the lines, I think ousting Clegg is your best chance of a Lib Lab coalition if that's what you want. Despite now trying to attack the Tories, when it comes to talking about after Thursday Clegg is making much more favourable noises towards the Conservatives. I'd also say he is closer to Cameron than Milliband politically.	14
0	It isn't designed to split the In vote. It is designed to present people with the actual choices/options. The average man and woman who wants In does not want what you and the others want. I mean that's the real issue. If you can be open and honest to these people there would be no need to have anything other than In/Out. They would know exactly what they were voting for. Funny isn't it. Has a resemblance to another vote doesn't it.	14
0	Yup, pretty much. All three main parties are polluted by Yewtree. You can find the list of names online if you try hard enough. 10 sitting MPs/Lords from all parties, 40 MPs/Lords total and a number of other high profile civil servants.	14
1	I can agree, its time for Europe to step out of the American shadow, we should be leading that move.	14

As for your immediately labelling me "conspiracy theorist" only, at least in my opinion, indicates your own vacuousness, vapidity, and inability to engage in constructive debate,  Perhaps you are led by what you are told ...  For myself, I tend to listen, discern, and than make my own mind up.  That having been said, you have my best wishes in your carrying on to be led ...

0	I didn't try to define patriotism, I just said what a patriot is not. Scots have a conflict of interest seeing as they can identify as British and Scottish.  What do you disagree with about my view on sovereignty? We are not sovereign as long as we remain in the EU. Anyone who would see Britain governed from abroad is against Britain.	14
1	It's not surprising, quite a few immigrants I know find the more socially conservative and traditional views of UKIP very appealing. And this in itself isn't surprising, since many of them come from countries which don't have the socially progressive history the UK has.	14
0	So what? The fact that wages are higher here means the cost of living is a lot higher, meaning they are barely able to send as much money back as they used to. The notion of thousands of them coming over here and claiming benefits is false, the strong majority work and contribute to our economy.	14

1	Every newspaper officially comes out in support of one party or another during a general election. In 2010 The Guardian came out in support of the Liberal Democrats.  The point of this is to explain the reasoning behind the decision that they have come to as a collective and even states "This newspaper has never been a cheerleader for the Labour party. We are not now."	14
0	&gt; I simply can't vote for Cameron who wants to give more tax cuts to the wealthy.  I can't believe people fall for Labour's bullshit. The top rate of income tax is higher under Cameron than it was 13 years under Labour.  What "tax cuts to the wealthy" is he offering now then anyway?	14

Marriage definition:"the legally or formally recognized union of a man and a woman (or, in some jurisdictions, two people of the same sex) as partners in a relationship."  Poly relationships simply cannot be marriage unless you completely throw away the whole meaning and definition of it, and if you do that you may as well just create something else entirely for poly relationships rather than distorting and tearing apart a time old institution like marriage	14

AS far as I know the only connecting thing here is that wasted orgasm Katie Hopkins immediately tweeted pictures of some convicted abusers asking Danczuk "if they were his friends too".

So instead of requiring a majority of the UK populations consent, he's willing to settle for the consent 600,000 Northern Irish and damn the rest.

What really happened was the green led council in Brighton cut binworkers salaries by £4000 to bring them in line with equal pay legislation. The workers went on strike and Lucas supported the workers over the council who were doing a 'rubbish' job.	14
0	What's Farage's solution? Mandatory boy-girl-boy-girl in political meetings? Deport the lot?	14

0	I am the sword in the darkness	14
1	&gt; but don't want to socially regress the UK by 50 years  Where's that in UKIPs manifesto?	14
1	&gt; The far right or extreme right is a political label used to identify parties and movements based on fascist, racist and/or extremely reactionary ideologies. Officially those on the far right embrace the concept of the "inequality of outcome", meaning that one group is naturally better than another.  So your assumption is that UKIP voters feel superior to immigrants? a very disingenuous assertion.	14
1	Remember he's from Manchester so this is pretty much an endorsement.	14
0	The problem I have is that most of the students seem be voting him out by voting in Labour; the party that ended free higher education in the first place, broke a manifesto promise in 2001 not to raise fees further, and who would currently support setting fees to double what they were in 2010. They're sending the message that it's ok to fuck over students because they have short memories and will happily vote for you again as soon as something else distracts them.	14

0	See I don't get this view, isn't britain meant to be the country that has stood for liberty, democracy and the values of a better life for all people even at our cost?   I mean we didn't fight the WW2 because we wanted to see if we could take on the Germans, we did it because we wanted to Protect a Eastern European country. I mean are we not that same country? Country that believed that working together with others coming to sensible laws, sharing helping other countries.   I just don't understand how you can claim UKIP stand for any of that.

1	Yes, exactly.  Scotland pays into the pot, and then it gets some back. Even though Scotland gets more back per head than England, it *pays more* into the pot than it gets back (and has done for over 30 years). So, Scotland is not subsidised.	14
0	Yup. They are on 2, according to the numbers above. That's over-represented.	14

0	Well to be honest, I wish Labour hadn't used The City to fund social progression in the UK, because it was a pretty short lived boom. They promised and delivered great public services but paid for them with windfalls and banking revenue rather than through taxation which is how it *should* have been done.   If they'd done it properly, we wouldn't have needed to cut public services to levels that could be paid for by the same (relatively) low rate of taxation when the cash cow dried up.	14
0	Unsure which is ironic, your tag-line or your comment.	14
0	A pure Tory government?  They had 306 seats on their own; they wouldn't have been able to put through a budget or a queen's speech without Lib Dem support.  The Lib Dems didn't save the country from the Tories, they enabled the Tories to govern the country in the first place.  The Lib Dems have become a socially liberal metropolitan version of the Tory party.	14

1	I wonder what the overlap is between people who are upset that Britain can't impose its agenda on the EU, and people who are upset that Scotland's MPs are going to try to impose their agenda on the UK.	14
1	Basic pay is £52,000 from 2015, up from £42,000 in 2011, just a modest 24% increase. A 5.5% increase in each of the last 4 years.	14
1	To be honest, many of us have just left.  I don't comment on politics there, since any suggestion that the Tories aren't evil psychopaths intent on personally hurting every redditor for their own twisted pleasure is downvoted.	14
1	This is a drop in the ocean of pensioner subsidies including:   1. Triple locked pension growth 2. Reforms to the annuity market 3. Mandatory pension contributions for everyone	14
1	If this were to happen I would actually be excited! About politics!	14
0	I'm not talking about any agenda. I'm talking about a society where people from different races and religions live, work and contribute to society together. Why is this so bad? Would you have an all-white Britain? Is that not racist?	14
1	Probably didn't advocate voting for the Tories.  He's been incredibly outspoken about this government for the past 5 years.  It was likely a scathing attack on Cameron and co. and advocated a UKIP vote.	14
1	They'll likely increase their share from 1 to 2 or 3 in the border constituencies as the Labour/LD vote collapses	14
0	Could you explain your comment? I don't understand it.	14
1	There are plenty of politically minded 16 year olds, and I for one believe that if you can be taxed, you should have a vote. The population in general is ill-suited to making informed political decisions, I don't see why the arbitrary age of 16 should mean that you're too stupid and naive to have a say in things. If you can pay tax and raise a family, then that qualifies you to have a voice in my opinion.	14
0	&gt; I think it's when the government starts taking a greater share of the economy by increasing spending much faster than GDP growth,   Can you not invent junk like this?  Massive increase in spending is when labour increased spending in which took 20 years and did it in 8 years.  Labour increased spending and you think that it wasn't really an increase because "b-but but lets compare it to the increase in GDP first!!!"   If it wasn't an massive increease in spending then during the blair ministry it would of look liked this.  http://i.imgur.com/5gzTahR.png  not this.  http://i.imgur.com/DOWV4Jz.png	14
1	The law is moronic. Parliamentary sovereignty means no future Parliament can be bound.	14
0	&gt;Would you consider the BBC biased  lol, is this even a question? Of course they are. Have you ever watched a BBC program with Cameron or Farage on it? The audiences and hosts are all hostile, and simply want to use even slightly right wing candidates as punching bags for all their air time.  Now I disagree with Cameron and Farage on some issues, but I do believe political broadcasting should be absolutely fair. Farage has had the patience of a saint, because I would simply shit all over anyone if they invited me onto their show thinking they and their audience could just crap over me for an hour.	14
0	I understand where you are coming from and happen to share similar concerns.   But free speech and criticism of a religion are frankly light-years away from the active persecution of a minority.	14
0	Nice in theory, but difficult especially considering the difference between learning a language and being completely fluent. They can go to all the English lessons they want, but stick them in a noisy job centre office in Sunderland and even many of us could have difficulty.	14
0	Well thats because UKIP is a coherent entity with a singe goal. British Muslims, not so much...	14
1	I am not a Labour voter. I am not, broadly speaking, a fan of Labour. With that in mind, can we all please agree that whether or not a man looks good while eating a sandwich should have NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with how we vote?	14
1	"We're cutting support for the poor and vulnerable whilst we lower taxes for the richest in society, only because we have to make the difficult, unpopular decisions mind."  Is that the sort of bollocks you're on  about?	14
1	/u/Ivashkin really needs to stop defending the actions of other mods.	14

0	I think it was how he responded to it.  If he had said "Im incredibly sorry for what happened to tuition fees but it was out of my control" then I dont think he would have gotten much shit for it, but what he said was more along the lines of "People who want lower fees are delusional".  Of course I might have got played by headlines, but thats the popular view.	14
0	It used to annoy me. Now I see the benefit in that UKIP aren't going to get seats.  I would still like a move towards a more proportional parliament but I think that some form of regionalism or connection to a constituency is important.	14
1	A grand coalition should be giving you a good feeling, it would destroy both the major parties support base.	14
1	This image gets posted every single election.	14
0	So why didn't you decide to vote for one of the non Tory parties that wasn't shit?	14
1	The fact that they chose to segregate themselves is not really the issue. The issue is that it was the only option available. If a lady had turned up and wanted to sit with the men she would have not been allowed.   &gt;Do we start telling people their "free" choices are unacceptable?  It depends if their 'free choice' impacts on anyone other than themselves. Creating a segregated seating arrangement forces women who do not actually want to sit apart from the men to do so. If they want to adhere to these outdated practices in their own homes then so be it, but this was a public meeting open to all.	14
1	I'd like you to bring your polling card. :)	14
1	I'm no fan of Labour but I wish people would stop using this bullshit argument. If the Tories were in power during the global recession it probably would have hit us even harder.	14

0	&gt; And that would indeed be bad if Scottish independence were a bad thing, which is is not.  Well the majority of people in the UK, including Scotland disagree with you.   &gt;Just like Labour is blamed for the independence of India?  Its meaningless to make such comparisons, when the only similarity is an independence movement. I could point to the creation is Israel just as easily to prove my point.	14
1	Put the other way... HELP THE TORIES BY ALLOWING THEM TO POINT TO VOTE SHARE!	14
1	So that's Indy, FT and Economist coming out in support of Tory-LD coalition.	14
1	'The other one' implies that they only have 2 supporters.	14
0	SNP logic:  "Something wen't wrong in Scotland? Must be them dirty sassenachs down south!"  Just like how Yes supporters will blame losing the referendum on 'immigrants' because clearly no true scotsman would dare to be a part of the Union.(not that they see no voters as real scots anyway)	14
1	Wow, that is a pretty accurate tl;dr.	14
0	Have you ever considered that the ECHR is misconceived.  That trying to overlay one system of law on top of another is bound to lead to an almighty mess.  The Common law was a system that has grown organically over centuries, there was nothing to stop it continuing to grow and adapt, rather than having a top down system imposed on it by dictat.	14
1	They do, and there's fuck all we can do about it if we don't leave.	14
0	Pervert. Does the sex scandal never end.	14
0	There has always been a huge backlash against immigration - the Irish, Indians, Pakistani, Caribbean and now the EU.  Then in hindsight everyone always agrees that it was driven by racial intolerance.	14
1	Gainsborough has been tory since 1924, with only brief Liberal interludes going back to 1885 also.  Most likely voting LibDem to show national support.	14

1	To be fair, the EEC referendum did achieve one thing. It was the only  year the UK has ever been a net recipient from the EU.	14
1	I can't stand UKIP, but I still think an electoral system where they're slated to get 1-3 seats on almost 14% of the vote, and where the SNP are slated to get 52 seats on 4% of the vote, is horrendous. ([Source](http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/homepage.html)) I don't think UKIP voters should be disenfranchised any more than any other group.	14
1	Germany has a mixed system, not PR.  Germany's political system is a more interesting and relevant example generally for possible constitutional reform than the free-for-all PR radicals want. Its upper house, federal system, electoral system etc. all fit Germany well in ways that are applicable to the UK.	14

1	Everyone on reddit unanimously hates him perhaps, but not everyone in Britain. If that were true he wouldn't be polling so highly.  Reddit is typically left wing and anti establishment, the conservatives are the right wing establishment and so are hugely under represented here.	14

1	Yes, that's exactly what I said.	14
1	I considered that, and came to the conclusion that the creation of a future head of state, by a future head of state, was reasonably political.	14
0	Is she? Fair enough. I can still understand why people don't want to vote for someone who isn't British.	14
1	&gt; EDIT: did some research, Q stands for 'questioning' not queer as this hack has it. Oooops, BBC hahahaha  Err... not really. It can stand for "Questioning", but "Queer" is far more common, since it's seen as all-encompasing (and stops the acronym getting ridiculously long). Usually it's "LGBTQ"	14
0	Not sure if your serious you might as well have said "wall to wall pakis"	14
0	Lol us defense cuts.  Like telling a fat kid they can only have 12 candy bars instead of 15!	14
0	Maybe, just maybe, we should import a massive amount of white people into say, South Africa and impose a new government based around our whims that demonizes the native black population while demanding handouts and help from them. I mean it'd be racist if they didn't right? And no one could possibly be hypocritical and inconsistent and support this type of government in the UK but not in South Africa, right?	14
1	&gt;the whole of the media - both left and right - persuade them it's a bad thing and they listen.  Welcome to the EEC referendum m8.	14
1	This is why I hate FPTP Cameron's gonna win the most seats and most votes, and ironically because he opposed electoral reform it's probably gonna cost him his job	14
1	Considering we share resources with the French forces, we should be amicable.	14
1	Poor Peter Hitchens. Too conservative for the Tories, too left-wing for Labour.	14
0	&gt;The only way that ordinary people can resist is to deny the states monopoly on violence, and fight for their rights.  We would point out that said "fighting" and "resisting" is its own form of violence/authority. It's bad when the state does it.. but when a non-state actor does it, as long as the violence is done toward the goal of destruction of the nation state, it is to be tolerated or encouraged.  This is why the far-left are extremely dangerous.	14
0	Yeah? I'd fucking tear you a new one.	14
0	I think you mean the people you're hanging around with. It's the same with the varied political sphere I'm apart of, we could all debate each other for hours, but BTEC Barry and Hairdresser Helena from the local college still only believe what the face book propaganda tells them, or they don't care.	14

1	Thatcher 1983 increased her majority, but she was facing Michael Foot...	14
0	Please go back to TRP and stay there, rather than bothering everyone else with your terrible views.	14
1	Bear in mind that Labour doesn't need to make a deal with SNP, since they would shoot themsleves in the foot if they VONCed a Labour government.	14
1	Yeah, you'd struggle to get Gordon Brown to vote Labour in 2010 tbh.	14
1	It is so difficult to actually put into words I doubt it could ever get through parliament. Any issues would be covered under existing legislation.	14
0	&gt; Most of the increased investment in public services was funded.  But funded by what?	14
1	Drawing a picture of Mo is perceived as Islamaphobia. Why should non-Muslims be forced to follow the rules of Islam?   The very term has been coined to deflect criticism of the religion. It is perfectly rational to question those views held by Muslims which do not fit with a Western society.   This isn't a complicated topic. The very idea that this has been proposed is an insult to free thinking and a sinister preview of a Labour government.	14
0	Farage is a member of the East India Club which is men only.  I presume he finds this equally outrageous?	14
0	No, you're missing the point. It's not a big amount of money to either of them, Cameron has a 7 figure trust fund and Farage still has his millions from his trading days (along with that good old EU gravy train).	14
0	Here in America it's completely taboo to question Jewish loyalty as well, [even though Israel-backed groups have distributed surveys to American Jews attempting to gauge their loyalty to Israel versus their loyalty to the United States](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.554651).  Sen's remarks were pretty tasteless but not "outrageous".	14
0	Yes, David Mitchell clearly isn't intelligent to do anything more than tell a joke.	14
1	Agreed. Not a measure in sight.	14
0	And that contributed towards absolutely fucking their economy.	14
1	Yup, he's also offered the reasons why it all came about and been fully sorry for it. You only really get this from liberals.	14
1	I am old enough to have lived it sunshine. Don't piss down my back and tell me it's raining. If you want to talk about wealth and my parents it's Harold Wilson you wanna talk about.	14
1	Does it count as a smear if UKIP does it to itself? More of a cock-up than anything else.	14
0	Not quite, there are a few differences.	14
1	Too bad. We voted against it.  People need to start thinking before they make an important decision. Why we didn't go for it when we had the chance, I have no idea.	14
0	There's certainly a possibility I'd say, in order to keep the Union together.	14
0	The point is they don't care. A person could have made a chain of comments in a thread with hundreds of others and they could be the best comments in there. But once this battle begins and a target (them) has been acquired it only goes one way.	14
1	I think Britain is probably the only country in the world where someone having had the best education the country has to offer is actually considered an impediment to their ability to govern.	14

1	Youre in the wrong sub for that, baton down the hatches for the downvotes my friend.	14
0	&gt;So segregation is fine if it's following our cultural rules but not any others?  Not ones that run counter to our own cultural values.  &gt;That's a strong sweeping accusation bordering on racism.  It's an accurate statement that applies to a lot of Muslims and isn't remotely racist or related to race.  &gt;So are Muslims the only ones who enforce segregation with violence or do Christians and Jews as well?  No and probably. That doesn't make it OK and doesn't invalidate criticism of Islam.	14
1	Am I The only one who thinks this is actually a good move? A bit to symbolic but an excellent way to remind yourself of the promises	14
0	It's not if you're thrifty, but how can you be against the proposed cuts? If you can't afford 2 children the tax payer already subsidised, why should you be subsidised for a third, fourth or fifth? Limiting to 2 children isn't cutting birthrates for anyone.  As for not giving anything back to society, I pay more per year than most people pay in 10 and I employ people, I can afford to have kids but have chosen not to, under these cuts I won't be able to receive benefit anyway if I did.	14

0	Yeh I suppose. I dont understand the greens environmental/social thing. Letting anyone and everyone in the country, provinding loads of social housing.... to me these are sure fire ways to guarantee you mess up communities, social structures and put even more stress on our resources and environment.	14
0	i hear you but thats not what he is saying, he's saying an anti-tory majority will be delegitimised despite the former potentially only having 34 per cent of the popular vote and the later over 50 per cent.	14
1	Yeah, how can anyone have different political opinions to me!	14
0	&gt; Political and legal rights are different to economic policy.  You don't think they're linked at all? That what the government chooses to spend money on, has nothing to do with social justice?	14

1	Was that his goof though? I thought it was the tories that blocked it?  Forgive me if I have the wrong end of the stick!	14
1	This is why we have The House of Lords.	14

0	voteswap ;)  Labour and Green supporters swap votes to keep out the Tories. - http://voteswap.org/	14
1	Not really. They're *MPs* because a plurality of their constituents voted for them.  They're Cabinet ministers because Cameron chose them to be.	14
0	And these people think they're old enough to vote, haha.	14
0	&gt;Or do we want to remain in, and maintain the balance of power, our strategy for hundreds of years.  That is utter utter utter utter horse shit, the reason Britain got involved in the Napoleonic wars WW1 and WW2 was to stop the unification of Europe as it was thought to be a direct threat to the British empire. If you even dare try to argue against that point, i'll hunt you down and beat you senseless with several very thick and large history books you muppet.	14

1	[Borrowing stayed constant though](http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/net-borrowing-96-12-600x531.png), including a surplus for a few years, so spending was covered up by growth and tax, which is why as the article says the national debt stayed constant.  As the author points out the real issues were deregulation and a dependance on financial services, begun by the Tories in the late 80s, taken to the next level by New Labour, and opposed by neither of the two big parties at the time leading to the banking crisis.	14
0	because it will almost definitely exist under a circumstance where the Tories won more seats than either of these parties.	14
0	It's infrastructure is run by the state. So housing, healthcare, food, power, education etc. will continue to run.	14
0	&gt; so long as they are within the confines of the legal jurisdiction of this country which stops at this countries borders in most instances.  Obviously.   And fine, we disagree. But the law as it stands agrees with me because we take the more humane view. That is a positive thing.	14
1	A percentage of ballots that are listed as spoiled suggests unhappiness and need for reform / change. A percentage of the population not voting at all is easy to be shrugged off as 'electoral laziness' by the political establishment - If anything they'll just work to improve their marketing techniques instead of realising the real issue.  Be clear and be heard. Spoil your ballot.	14

0	I hope you're referring to /u/Orcnick who is all for a 600,000 Northern Irish voters holding the rest of the UK in the EU.	14
0	Actually I do.  Originally common law was solely the customary law of the English people whose evolution was solely in the hands of judges under Case Law.  However parliament came to have an increasing role in the development of Common law via Statute law which was created by Acts of Parliament.  Hence the slave trade and  the British Empire was ended by Acts of Parliament or Statute law which became part of the corpus of Common law.  I'm afraid its you who does not know what he is talking about.	14
1	I'd like it not to be referred to as a 'tax' all the time. It's a charge or a reduction on entitlements, not on money earned afaik.	14
1	This is just hilarious. The EU has no ambitions for an EU army they said. Now they say that they think it is a rather good idea. The people of UK Politics.	14

1	With all due respect, I think you're being naïve. I wish it was true, but people aren't all naturally charitable and most people are too pre-occupied with their own lives to worry about someone else's. Societies across the planet show that people are generally not very charitable, and capitalism itself is based on feeding the human tendency for greed. That's what the profit motive is all about.  I'd love to think you where right, but I just don't have your faith in humanity.	14

0	They have the nukes.  We should release a chemical pathogen wiping out their entire population, then annex the remains. Added bonus, large swaithes of the North will be killed off as well. Win win.	14
1	Its not even what they did. Cameron has said that hes planning to cut welfare by another 20billion (I think! I forgot the exact figure) to balance the books and then cut taxes when he reaches a balanced budget.  The people who benefit most from tax cuts are the rich. Inequality will continue to increase in the next 5 years of Cameron wins another term that's for sure.	14
1	Source? 7 million seems incredibly high.  Something is afoot, I feel it in my bones, with this and the press being completely dishonest about the constitutional process of forming a government.	14

0	So does the racism of UKIP.  See how this works? Small handful of cockwombles and suddenly millions of people are all bastards.	14
1	I still don't get how having some sort of deal with the SNP is screwing the voters of England.   Because they didn't vote for them? In that case all parts of the UK apart from England have been screwed over countless times.	14
0	Shouldn't it be fair to say that there is no such thing as a better or more informed opinion? I dislike the left wing and think they're wrong, but I completely respect their opinion and choices as much as I'd hope they respect mine. That's what voting is all about, your ideas, your situation, your opinion. I vote whoever will make my life better and I imagine they vote whoever would make their life better. I don't know many people who would vote one party because they make other peoples lives better over their own.	14
0	Yeah here's the thing. When he gets asked by someone from the BBC about this, he explains his comments and what UKIP's policies are. And that should be that. The researchers for all the other BBC outlets don't suddenly become deaf and blind. Don't try and defend them. It is pathetic. The case is the same for this type of shit they pull on all the other parties too.	14
0	If you think that is accurate you are kidding yourself. A swing to either In or Out like that has not happened and will not happen.	14

0	Who said anything about trusting Labour? I wouldn't trust them to look after my pet log.	14
1	I know the papers are making a real meal of it, but to me it seems to boil down to a single number - how many seats the tories get.  If they get 290+ then it's Cameron, if they get less it's Milliband.  Does anyone else think there's anything else to it? Is the 290 figure what we should be watching for, or is there something else?  I'm thinking there's nothing else to do but wait until about 1am and see what the projections are at that point.	14
0	Your stance is kind of idiotic. There's considerably more to democracy and democratic legitimacy than just the odd referendum. If the people wanted out of the EU, they should've formed a party that would take them out. And look, they have! And that party is going to get barely any seats!  Case closed.	14
1	True, but my comment is not an endorsement of the Tories, just pointing out that this "oh that whole recession and deficit thing wasn't our fault, we never overspent" line by Labour is utter rubbish, they've clearly learned to lie better and nothing else.	14
1	You seem to be confusing butthurt with calling you out for a ridiculous idea of what the SNP are, represent and intend to do.  and to top it all off you reply with more tribalistic nonsense.	14
0	The blind? The disabled? Really?	14
0	They're going to get barely any, and it's not impossible that they'll get none at all.	14
0	Didn't they do something like this before the European elections?	14
1	Sadly, I think the correct headline would be "It was the SNP wot won it".	14
1	Hang on, no. That is exactly the point, debt as a % of GDP was not growing for the majority of those 13 years. Most of the increased investment in public services was funded. People forget that for the first term of the labour government, spending was very constrained and only slightly increased in the second term. By and large, New Labour were fiscally sound. You can say that they screwed up banking regulation (among many other things) but the point is that they were not fiscally negligent.	14
0	That's not biased. It's merely an accurate description.	14
0	What a load of bollox.  Best of a bad bunch?  Tell that to the 1MM+ Irish that starved to death or the people in the Boer concentration camps.  The British Empire is covered in blood, don't act otherwise.	14
1	&gt; Labour candidate DEFECTS to Ukip on eve of General Election  Holy shit, better read that!  &gt; A FULL-TIME campaign assistant to Labour parliamentary candidate  Well, still kinda a thing, but no where near what they said to begin with...  &gt; Georgie Ramsay joined the party fairly recently and was doing some part time admin for us but very little campaigning.  So I guess they'll need someone else to get coffee then?  This is a nothing story.	14
0	Any one serious about EU integration (whether for or against) has always known an EU army would be inevitable.  Farage didn't "call" anything per se, he said said what was in the minds of all Europhiles.  But it's foolish to be up in arms and assume the this EU army will automatically involve the UK as if Parliament would even do such a thing.	14

0	It's always been this way, and from all sides. You need to stop adhering to this tribalistic moronic standard when it doesn’t exist.	14
1	The Eaton thing is more problematic. You can get in to Oxford by being smart,  though being middle-class or wealthy obviously helps. But only the truly posh twats send their kids to Eaton. Having a cabinet full of Eatonites is like having an aristocracy again.	14

1	I'm considering voting Labour or Lib Dem.  Labour, I'm not sold on their job guarantee for young people - particularly the 'they have to take the job or lose their benefits'. Having been subject to the shittiness of the job centre, I don't think this is the right approach. They will force young people into irrelevant and useless jobs and the costs to have them paid minimum wage are being covered by the government. Just further undercutting workers.  Liberal Democrats - I don't think raising personal tax allowance is the most effective way of fixing poverty. For those already meeting the personal tax allowance it won't help them at all.	14
0	Your sobriety bores me. There is nothing wrong with taking certain drugs. It’s an amazing experience that should be experienced by more people.	14
1	&gt;looking to get fucked up the arse?  I doubt we'll see a second Tory term.	14
0	The cultures aren't hugely different, Farage constantly makes the point of these countries being ex-communist. These people just want to get their heads down at work, not try and overthrow the government and oust out all private enterprise haha.	14

0	The current system is the system that everyone voted for. We chose this.	14

0	Fucking hell. Pull your head out of your arse.  /r/iamverysmart	14
1	Certainly no worse than if Labour had won all those seats.	14
1	This is not "delusional". UKIP getting 0 seats is within the 90% margin of error according to http://www.electionforecast.co.uk/. UKIP getting 3 seats is also within the 90% margin of error.	14

0	The solution is simple, subject foreign rapists to torture here, then he'd have to be deported.	14
0	I made it clear. If we can be open and honest about what In actually means than I have no problem with an In/Out referendum. This happened once before. When people thought they were agreeing to be part of a trading bloc.	14
0	&gt;Not sure what your point is here. how is that a benefit.  because working people's payments into pension funds now are subsidising the excessively generous terms of current pensioners.	14
0	It can't, you're right, but maybe with a selection of writers you can have a selection of bias on both sides.	14
1	He's counting on the fact that the SNP are so anti-Conservative that they'll back him on the important stuff anyway just to keep the Tories out, without any need for a formal deal.	14
0	Cameron is leader of the Tories. You vote for his party candidates. The EPP is not a party, it is a group of parties and Juncker is not the leader of it. He wasn't even formally nominated for the position until *after* the election. Then he ran uncontested in a secret ballot. How distinctly Soviet...	14
1	Not that I disagree with spoiling your ballot (I was going to do it but I changed my mind last minute) but honestly what good does that do? Who ever looks at the spoiled ballot numbers, if anything I think I see more people who talk about voter turnout (which includes spoilt ballots right?). Especially when spoilt ballots include all the people who fucked up, which apparently is the majority of spoilt ballots.  Voter turnout is an important statistic as it shows the number of people who are disillusioned or apathetic. And the government should be working towards understand the causes and then reduce it.	14
1	The Queen will take this opportunity - a hung parliament with no possible majority - to seize power.  Leaders of major parties will appear to yield authority to her Government of National Unity on live TV, as a caretaker until new elections within a year.  But within a year, they will all be dead - and Will and Kate will be the acceptable faces of a new feudalism.  Screencap this post.	14
0	&gt; And yes they should also have tightened up the regulation on banking and not let the financial sector get out of control at the expense of other industries.  This is the biggest betrayal I think. They put all their eggs in one basket.	14

0	Go fuck yourself. It is about me, I'm one of the people who actually fucking lived at the time who you're saying is wrong based on reading a fucking TV magazine.  It may shock you to find this out but we were more and better informed about politics than now because we didn't have as many people like you regurgitating absolute bollocks on the internet.

1	We've never claimed to be an absolute free speech subreddit, I believe there's one called "GBR Politics" or something like that if you're interested in that though.	14
1	Yes but that is a bit like saying Harold Shipman would have been a good GP if only he hadn't been a serial killer.	14
0	No I don't. I think the system needs a change. Voting reform. Maybe possibly educational reform which sees politics actually taught to people. But apart from that it seems to work.	14
1	Crazy that the Tories have gained seats!	14
1	The fact that someone who LITERALLY said, *and I quote*:   &gt;“The economy is just a metaphorical device. It's not real, that's why it's got the word 'con' in it.”   Is taken seriously by any even remotely educated homo sapien is deeply disturbing.	14
0	Hahahaha are you serious? Of all the serious social and economic issues that come with politics the only major chnge worth mentioning for you is the recycling rate? Now that is a desperate argument.	14
0	Why not both?  It's bullshit in any case.	14

0	Besides Iraq, can you name *all* the wars you find so egregious? Whilst you're at it, I'd love to know what US bombing you disagree with. Is it the bombing of IS in Iraq and Syria? Don't want to hurt those poor misguided kids, it would be Islamaphobic, am I right? And yh, drone strikes that frequently wipe out high ranking AQ operatives in Yemen, Pakistan and Afghanistan is totally wrong! Their lives matter :,(  The anti-US circlejerk this sub has hard on for is pathetic.	14

1	“The allegations range from neglect of duty by failing to adequately investigate on the basis of intelligence or to deal with incidents appropriately, inappropriate comments and suggestions of corrupt relationships between police officers and offenders.”  How did you get the police were "riddled with abusers" from that?   In my mind the title of the article is deliberately misleading. I personally have no doubt that some officers may be implicated in the actual abuse but that's not what this says and there is absolutely no evidence on offer to suggest the Police were "riddled with abusers".	14

1	Ukip second. Lib dems last	14
1	If everyone who disagrees with the incumbent doesn't vote then it remains a safe seat. If you and others like you vote then it becomes increasingly marginal. Tactical vote if you must but every vote does count, even if it is only to demonstrate that people are prepared to get out and vote even in a safe seat, against those they disagree with.	14
0	Throughout the discussion I think you eased your main point a bit...... I would support focusing on deficit as it's very important. However, removing the debt completely? Tough chance. Remember the Wikipedia link I've given you? Only 5 countries in the world don't have national debt.	14

0	Are you denying there has been a "pause" in temperature rise since 1998?	14

Wonder if there is a 'shy lib dem factor' after the coalition, personally I try to avoid the conversation whenever it's brought up as people only ever mention tuition fees.	14
0	Maybe. We also have people who are far too young to vote. But we engage them in discussion. That's a positive thing.   It might be nice if we could actually educate them rather than them thinking they know everything.	14
1	Hopefully Lib Dems will be involved with a Labour government and would stop this shit. The idea that all religions are equal and we all have to accept them as good is intolerable to me.	14
1	Me: There are people with no arms and no legs who have to be continuously assessed. In case they grow back, presumably. This is a disgusting government, and I hope they more than lose tomorrow.  You: There is a lot you can do with a mind and a voice.  Can you give me a context where that *isn't* offensive?	14
1	God this is embarrassing. Farage handled it extremely well though.   Kind of reminds me of that woman in the US a few years ago shouting that Barack Obama's a communist  at some sort of rally and then when she was confronted she made a complete tit of herself.

You can claim them while in work, it is not means tested, and it is supposed to help with the additional costs of being disabled. Also, GPs services are massively overstretched as it is, from experience it is difficult enough to get medical evidence from GPs for benefit claims and do not see a huge issue with providing an incentive.	14

0	&gt; I said the increase wasn't "massive" or "extraordinary". To assess that you have to compare the figures to GDP.  How about you check the chart again? an increase of 20 bn pounds between a quarter was achieved in 1970-1990 and when blair became PM it happened in just 1997 to 2007.     http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/NAEXKP03GBQ652S   Also the 1997 election occurred in may 1 of 1997 and by Q3 the labour government would already control the finances in which afterwards spending increased dramatically.	14

And is this blog seriously trying to claim that there weren't Labour supporters and affiliates in that audience? Maybe we should look at everyone who asked a question? Or should we just restrict it to the questions we didn't like?  Maybe the author of the blog has been caught out that the "shy Tory" stereotype seemed to disappear during last nights programme?	14

1	Presumably the intolerance for UKIP has awakened some more aggressive activists (there's been alot of reports about people destroying UKIP signage and going as far as assaulting someone who defended it), and in certain areas this has probably spilled over into intolerance for right-wing parties general.	14
0	The problem is that the majority don't care enough to vote, which implies that they don't care enough to strike. If the government has to prepare for a general strike every time 10% of a union's membership get annoyed enough to vote for a strike, it give disproportionate power to those people.   Personally, I'd deregulate the unions and give businesses the power to sack strikers (provided that all strikers were treated equally)	14

0	Russell Brand is a fucking ex addict moron who still looks off his face half the time so his endorsement of Labour is no surprise to me. I'll stick with voting UKIP. Oh, and I'm voting for them because I agree with the economic policies of free markets and giving people more spending power with a smaller state removing loads of the quangos. I do not care about the other stuff you'll bleat on about.	14
1	That's naive. Electoral systems aren't just for fuzzy-wuzzy ideas about democracy, they're about building stable Governments and political systems in the societies they serve.  Shrugging your shoulders at the prospect of a Neo-Nazi party entering Government in a society where that is a real possibility is stupid.	14

1	He wants a level playing field, allowing people to make up their minds based on the issues, not based on which side has more money. He also wants to define who gets a vote and who does not (if you'll remember, last year the same thing happened with the Scottish referendum in that 16 year olds were allowed to participate).  Please explain again why his approach is 'disgusting and undemocratic'?	14

1	You get the impression the "activist" just kind of expected to be able to shout his misinformed rantings at Farage while he and his entourage scurried away as is usually the case with hecklers.  I imagine he hadn't really thought past that point and realised he was way out of his depth the moment Farage stopped to address him.	14
1	Went to my polling station in Glasgow today, there was just two old blokes outside, 1 Labour and 1 SNP, they were sat sharing a flask of tea and discussing the football.	14
1	The SNP can never get a UK majority, so it is probably in their interest to make sure nobody else can either.	14
1	You know the Green party isn't just one person? There is a multitude of views under a Green umbrella. Just like the Conservative party have Eurosceptics and Europhiles, and Labour contains socialists and redistributive capitalists. Green party official policy may be anti-nuclear now, but it might not be in future. And the great thing is all you have to do is become a member and you get a vote on whether or not that changes. Not something you can say of any of the other parties.	14
0	borez, ivashkin has pointed out, the user was banned for discussing the censorship of their comment on other subreddits. Do you agree with Ivashkin that users should be banned for this? Did Ivahskin notify you that you will be expected to ban users who discuss the censorship on this subreddit on other subs?

1	It is just one of those things which is "bad" - no further explanation seems to be provided. They have a lot in common, aside from Scotland being independent. And if the people of Scotland overwhelmingly want independence, we have to respect that really. Same with a referendum on leaving the EU, or on anything else.   I suspect they could be part of a coalition on the understanding they get another independence referendum. If it is a No vote again, then that is game over for that idea. Even if there is a Yes, it is miles away from a certainty.	14

Edit: doe vote if you want but I'd rather not have those old royal cunts about either. In fact I'll be voting for the party which abolished those Royal paedo cunts.	14
1	An EU army where the most important member (Germany) has to field it's units with broomsticks instead of rifles in exercises and less than 70% of its air force is in working condition. Not to mention that we all speak different languages, use different equipment (not all of it being compatible, but a decent amount) and train differently. There is a reason  that anyone with any military knowledge opposes this vehemently. NATO is fine - integrating any further is a ridiculous idea and further points to the EU super state that they are trying to create.	14
0	&gt;Dumb public  Can't be any dumber than the greek public that voted themselves more money for the last 30 years.	14
1	It's essentially the abolition of independent states. If they do not have a monopoly on the use of force then they are not really states.	14
0	Oooh, hark at her. Please tell me why someone who doesn't live in the country should come and tell me why we should all be  obedient boys and girls  and continue voting for the corrupt, complacent, toss-pot of a party that SLabour has become - something I've - to my shame - been doing for decades. No more, there is now an alternative available.  And whilst you are at it , you might want to explain why a comedian based elsewhere  is somehow blessed with more  political wisdom about the political situation in Scotland to enable him to  pontificate how I should vote?	14
1	That's so ridiculous it's not even satire.	14
0	Zero.  Scotland could have won their False Choice Referendum with more democracy operating and hence more sanity operating in the powermongering that occurred during the shitstorm of Economic FUD and beggered promises of Westminster.  The same will be repeated with clinging to EU Treaty Structures demanding:-  * OPT-OUT + In**side** EU Treaty Structures = False Choice Referendum on reform scope (Hence Junker is correct)  vs  * OPT-IN + Out**side** EU Treaty Structures = Real Choice Referendum on reform scope  It's very simple and obvious logic according to the rules written down determining legal options as opposed to false words and fake promises of The Great Deception.	14

0	A thread full of /r/scotlanders who don't like UKIP? Well I never. Scottish nationalism best nationalism.	14
0	How about a serious answer? This is clearly a serious issue for many people, but I've not heard *anyone* give an example of legitimate behaviour that would be stopped by this. Its all just slippery slope arguments...	14
1	&gt; I think more jobs is better  I think the quality of the jobs REALLY matters. You could open sweat shops here in the UK and get that job number number, but it's not what we want (to use an extreme example).   I think it is a valid criticism to question the quality of the jobs created.	14

0	Or maybe you could avoid posting multiple ignorant, inflammatory, baiting comments in the same thread? Then you can be almost 100%  sure you will be free of 'harassment'.	14
1	Maybe no one is talking about it because we've been quite good at reducing our CO2 emissions? We're meeting our targets and there is nothing to suggest we're going to go off course anytime soon.   The big drop in CO2 in the next 5 years will come from shutting down a large chunk of our coal power stations which is likely to happen regardless of who gets in power. In many ways the next 5 years is an easy break from Green Policies.	14
1	So you're not allowed to think that people seem like good or bad people now, without being childish?  He met all the people, obviously didn't like Farage and liked Bennet and Lucas as people.	14

1	Behold the monolith of vague.	14
1	The SNP are a really fantastic party with fantastic policies.  It's just a shame about their whole wish to separate from the UK and that I can't vote for them in England.  They are like the Labour Party I had always wanted.	14
1	It's an entirely meaningless statement. Everyone has the right to complain, it's enshrined in Englishness. I assume the foreign UK members are much of a muchness on this.	14
1	Maybe some people also genuinely want to stay in the EU?	14
1	&gt;Con/Lib/UKIP/DUP will be enough to ensure a majority without question.   Libs won't do a coalition with UKIP  &gt;Talk about damage limitation. UKIP will get 5+ seats at the absolute minimum. UKIP support is underrepresented.   How do you do that remind me thing? Just for when you're wrong?   RemindMe! 3 Days "Have UKIP got more than 5 seats?"	14
1	It's not the same image, it's the same polling station and the same redditor posting a new picture of it for Karma, if you look back the red writing gets more and more faded.	14
1	Sorry guys - http://i.imgur.com/23viQs7.png	14
1	All i've seen on facebook is a bunch of 17/18 year old liberals going mental over UKIP  It's pretty cringing because none of them actually know the bare minimum of what they're talking about. One kid mistook a certain religion's previous homophobic comments to be comments from UKIP.	14
0	I despise the term hate speech, we didn't beat a bunch of braindead fascists in 1945 to have a different type of braindead fascist ban our freedom of speech.	14
1	If people who are presenting a danger to society are routinely being released into the public without supervision, that's a problem that should be tackled regardless of the convict's nationality. We shouldn't become an accessory to torture just because it might make us feel safer in this one situation.	14

1	This isn't how it will work at all.  Why do you think there has to be a formal deal with the SNP for the SNP to vote for a Labour Queen's speech? They're obviously going to want a Labour government over a Tory one whether there's a deal or not.  This whole idea that Labour has no option but to formally work with the SNP if it wants to get into power is one that's been cooked up by the SNP themselves and by the Tories. I can't believe how many people are going along with it.	14

0	&gt; So a three way spit roast is on the cards with Clegg and Miliband high fiving while they see to the SNP leader?   This sentence.  Why did you have to do that. Look at what you've gone and done now.	14
1	&gt; With PR they would never ever be in power ...  ... in a majority, true. But looking at the polls, if we had PR, we would likely see a Tory + UKIP majority. Labour + Lib Dem is just breaking 40%, greens AND SNP on top of that *might* break 50%. However, Tory + UKIP could break 50% on its own.	14

1	&gt; improve the finances of this country and lead to having spare money that could be used to improve situations like yours.  HAHAHAHAHA. You think the Tories are ever going to increase disability benefits or help the disabled in any way whatsoever? They'll give the wealthiest another income tax cut whilst increasing benefits for wealthy pensioners who'll vote for them. The Tories couldn't give two shits about the poor, sick or disabled.	14
1	I bet Twitter is imploding	14
0	Not towards any particular party, but they're certainly biased against UKIP. I'm glad Farage has taken to pointing it out now.	14

0	He's done a few on voting systems, like FPTP, SVT, PR and AV, but always substituted actual parties for fake animal - based politicians.  On taking influence from CGPGrey, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, but you might like to try branching out a bit and finding your own style for future videos.	14
0	Ummm no. I don't "take my toys and run off".   I try not to let people walk all over me, take money off me every day for nothing and tell me what I can and can't do in my own house though.   I don't expect you do either.	14
1	As far as I am aware referendums can only be questions that have yes or no answers anyway	14
1	I'm looking forwards to the Conservatives triumphant and glorious victory over the forces of socialism.  I don't have any facts, logic or rational judgement to suggest that will happen, but dammit, I have blind faith.	14
1	Good, it'd be a terrible, short-sighted move to oust him from his seat.	14
1	To be fair to the Guardian, they recently ran a feature showing how to tactically vote to get Miliband as PM...then did the same thing but showing how to vote Cameron in.  As biased as they are, I don't see any of the Murdoch or right wing papers doing the same.	14
1	Yeah, it's pretty shitty, no place for it in British politics.	14
0	Milliband will no longer be living in his mansion if he is PM.	14
0	No, but I suspect the Dutch would consider you a fool for moving to a country where you can't understand what people are saying, unless you are currently learning Dutch.  However, you are lucky Britain built a massive empire and spread English almost universally across the globe, so it's likely the Dutch you talk to will understand enough English anyway. But that still makes you ignorant. I can't imagine living in another country without being able to speak the basic language, not just for courtesy and efficiency sake, but just out of pure curiosity to learn the history, culture and tongue of the country.	14

1	Now though there's enough people wanting PR and the smaller parties are in a position to argue that we could actually see a genuine pull for it... it's one of the best things I can say about the SNP. They're still pushing for electoral reform even though they'll likely lose more than half their seats if we get it. It's a credit to them and shows they have genuine integrity.	14
1	Why?  Had the AV referendum been a yes, we still wouldn't have had an election till next week.	14

0	I didn't insinuate naivety. Young people tend to have less money to be taxed thats all. The older you get and harder you work, you just become less reliant on state help. You start thinking about your own family instead of the greater good socialist utopia.	14
1	This year the expectation is all seats without a good excuse will count overnight, so most seats should be in by 6-8am: you'll get a couple of important before 4am. You'll certainly get the results for the Sunderland seats at least:  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/11560314/Election-2015-results-what-time-does-each-constituency-declare.html  Therefore you'd expect negotiations on who'll form a government to start around 9am on the Friday morning.	14

1	I'll be a Counting Agent, we'll be standing on the other side of the table watching them count the votes.  I've pulled them up on ballots being placed in the wrong pile before (which when every 2nd ballot is for Labour, it's not surprising they go into autopilot mode sometimes).	14
0	but his own hypocrisy is.	14
0	&gt;They are not mutually exclusive	14
0	It's becoming quite plain that Farage is a bully when it comes to these things. The BBC policy, the SNP policy, this is stuff that he comes out with for no other reason than to punish people he doesn't feel tow the party line, and what's worse is that he's leveraging power that's completely misplaced in him. How many people are voting for him based on his EU position? Now he takes that power and abuses it to attack completely unrelated groups that he doesn't like.	14
0	what does that have to do with the point I was originally making? I was saying that the person knew from the title that the perpetrators were left wing because it was an act of violence. I pointed out that right wingers are no blushing violets when it comes to such attacks (not to mention the political affiliations of the perpetrators weren't even given in the article)	14
1	This is a statement, not a fact. The UK didn't want financial transaction tax on its biggest business so it was canned. The UK gets its way in the end.	14
0	I get what you're saying, but it really is quite a convenient excuse for not doing your job, isn't it? Even if you accept the testimony, and believe that this was why they didn't act, then at best these were the kind of people that would let truly horrific and squalid systematic abuse carry on because they were worried about being called racist...  Police...worried about being called racist....  There was clearly something very wrong with the culture in these institutions. But saying that problem was primarily racial sensitivity is just ridiculous.	14
1	I can't be anachrophobic. One of my best friends is a spider.	14
0	Yeah but we all know when someone like this resigns they were pushed.   Is it that hard for you to believe he was pushed considering people at UKIP have been sacked for less? Do you have to take everything to it's most disingenuous extreme?	14
0	&gt; maybe if we threatened to dump them where we thought they came from, we could get it out of them.  Knowing how much risk those people already take, I doubt it would repel to most of them. They are desperate to leave.....  &gt;I meant capping it to what we can actually afford without having to cut domestic services and benefits. Sure improve them and save money.  So you've changed your mind then? Or is it as long as there is some extra money to accommodate them, as in first we need to remove the deficit and only then increase any spending for asylum seekers?	14
0	&gt; "Do you think the UK should leave the EU?"   Would be my choice. And then we regulate so that only British Nationals can vote and make it so that both sides have regulated budgets, equal airtime etc.	14
0	&gt;Britain can't impose its agenda on EU  "But we'll impose whatever we like on you, here take this boat of immigrants who should be staying where they landed, not where they want"  EDIT: Nice downvote argument guys.	14

0	Cool attempt, nice to see the favour away from Tories.	14

0	Build some English regional parliaments, give them, the Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Irish Assembly the same powers, ditch the Barnett formula in favour of regional taxation powers.  Require both the House of Commons and all regional parliaments to adopt either AMS or STV.	14

1	REFERENDUM EVERYTHING!!!	14
0	Touché. Miliband just doesn't appeal to me whatsoever. He's like the clinton's as they say whatever it takes to get an audience to agree with theme. Miliband reminds me a lot like Hillary -- it's painful to watch.	14

0	&gt; Using that information to profile Pakistani throughout the country is racist....  I don't care what you call it. There is a problem of abuse not just of children but also of women in those communities.   I wouldn't just 'profile' them. I'd rip those communities apart. Expose everything that goes on - the abuse, the industrial level benefit fraud, the criminal activity, the attitudes towards women.  Once people see how it really is maybe they will stop worrying about things like 'oh its racist'	14
1	Because with the Charlie Hebdo thing and the cartoons of Mohammad, thousands and thousands of "moderate muslims" called for the punishment (or death) of the journalists responsible. This kind of thing just doesn't happen with other religions.	14
1	It isn't. It's Labour and the Tories that keep bringing it up.	14
1	It's also worth pointing out that you don't actually need a majority full stop, particularly in a parliament with more than three sizable parties. That's what a minority government is. All you really need is more MPs than the camp that wants you gone. If there are parties who are neither with nor against you, they might not join in a no confidence motion one way or the other.  Potentially that could apply to the SNP, who would not support a Tory motion, but might not necessarily support Labour either. So a Lab/Lib coalition would only need to be larger than the Tory bloc, not larger than everyone else combined.	14

1	It's easy to be the Labour party that everyone wanted when it's not your job to figure out how to pay for it all.	14

0	*compliment  How about you stop spelling like a child before berating someone else for having the mentality of one?	14
1	So? The soon this "special" relationship breaks apart, the better. America, as a nation, is one of the biggest pieces of shit in the world and goes totally against what the UK stands for or at least, used to.  Also, I find it lovely that if there is anything that can unite ukpolitics in argument, it's to call America cunts.	14

1	Might be going against the Reddit hivemind on this one, but I agree. If you aren't happy with how the country is being ran, surely you must vote and make your voice heard. I don't buy into this apathetic disenfranchisement bullshit, if you didn't vote you have no right to complain. You forfeited that when you chose not to vote.	14

1	If this is indeed the accurate result, it's a disaster for Labour.  A Labour collapse in Scotland was inevitable, but I would have thought they'd have made enough gains in Wales and the North of England to still end up making a net gain.  Strewth.	14

1	This article is quite correct.  The last time the SNP brought down a Labour minority government, Thatcher was the replacement and the SNP were destroyed at the next election for their part in bringing her to power.	14
0	Also in India. But since when are Indian citizens allowed to vote in the British Elections? One remembers that Indians NOT being able to vote is pretty much the reason India and Bangladesh and Pakistan are independent. No, what you mean is "these languages are spoken among people ethnically from the region". Not that these people are Commonwealth citizens since they are clearly citizens of the UK.   Also? You need to demonstrate work for 5 years in the UK and most employers need people to speak English.	14

0	Me too. They are a nuisance, leeching off our taxes, and ungrateful about it.	14
0	Where is the line between offence and harassment?	14
0	No, they represent those people's interests in parliament, sure. But they should not in any world be allowed to lead the country.  You know, I'd care less if I could vote for the same party in England, but I don't even have that opportunity, so it's ridiculous.   Another major point to consider is why should a party that want's to break up the country, be allowed to lead the country?	14
0	Cybernat.  Why has that term even come to be used?  Nationalists who are able to use the Internet. It means nothing and yet is banded about as some kind of insult with undertones of cyber terrorism.  It's all a bit pathetic really	14
1	Don't think that's enforceable, not that I have signs up but I live opposite a polling station, I'm of the opinion I can do what I want in my home, if I want to put out a sign I'll put out a sign.	14
0	&gt; We have NATO.  But NATO is very much American oriented and does not look at European security as the priority.   &gt; How?  Well we will have a European Joint military force, so we would not need as many US troops.  &gt; How and why?  Well we would not need to commit to joining america in pointless middle eastern wars in exchange for security.	14
1	Those comments though.  I think I need to step reading newspaper comments online now. I don't know if it's just this election or if it's normally like this during campaigning, but I feel like every single comments section I've read in the past 6 weeks has been like opening a sluice gate in front of my face. I know there are valid criticisms of the coalition, but accusations of shilling, immediate questions over loyalties of the author and the paper, and reducing the quality of the debate to pure shit has made me fucking lose all hope.	14
1	This is the stupidest thing I've seen all year, but why do we need to censor it? When Nick Griffin was on Question Time, did it spark an explosion of racism in this country like the coward-left predicted? John Milton knew what was up:  &gt;And though all the windes of doctrin were let loose to play upon the earth, so Truth be in the field, we do injuriously by licencing and prohibiting to misdoubt her strength. Let her and Falshood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the wors, in a free and open encounter.	14
0	I think people should be free to speak. We shouldn't be trying to stop people from campaigning in favour of the EU simply because Nigel Farage doesn't like it. Let's not pretend that these ideas are 50:50, one is far more popular, you can't try and legislate it into not being more popular.	14
0	Yep. Cannot argue with that. I have no confidence in this tory led coalition either.   It sounds very similar to 2010 when I voted labour. For me it was operation 'get rid of Gordon Brown at any cost'.	14

0	Winston Churchill was wrong, the best argument against democracy *isn't* a 5 minute conversation with the average voter, it's actually only 5 seconds, according to this video. Or perhaps it might be best to raise the voting age back to 21 and try again.	14
1	Who is coming though?	14
0	I stand by it. If you don't like unpleasant truths stick your head back in the sand.	14
0	so glad that people like you will have no mandate in parliament  [one upvote for every UKIP seat won]	14
1	It's why I'm very cautious of it.	14
0	I used to think I was sympathetic to proportional representation but then I saw your list of how the parties would fare under the system.  No way do I want an extremist party like UKIP holding the country to ransom with their simplistic claptrap.  I'd rather stick to first past the post.	14
1	They literally lost over 80% of their seats...	14
1	Eh, getting tuition fees down from being potentially unlimited (i.e. the Universities could charge whatever the hell they want) which both Labour and the Tories supported, to a fixed price increase and lower repayments than under the old system was pretty good going in my opinion.	14
0	Ken Clarke. Andrew Percy seems a good bloke and was the MP for my neighboring constituency.	14
0	How come you never pipe up when people are grouping *all* muslims together?	14
0	That's the joke. And I was pretty amused at someone describing themselves as a "thinking person".  No one here is going to bother listing the hundreds of well worn and argued reasons why no one takes the green party seriously at this stage. I'm sorry. Not even Russel Brand wants to directly align himself with them. Only backing Lucas.	14
0	We all were really. That's why the demographic at /r/Uk and /r/europe are so left wing.	14
0	Not if the borrowing is more responsible. I just don't think running a surplus right now would be a good idea. Cuts have already stretched the nhs to breaking point and when everyone apart from the tories are calling their cuts 'savage' I think they might just go a little too far.	14
1	To be fair, this is a qualitative difference. She's an actual Conservative activist masquerading as an undecided voter sneaking in to ask a question designed to catch Miliband out. Farage was complaining about *the entire audience* and went out of his way to criticise them *during the debate*. As far as I know Miliband hasn't whined to the same extent, he's just taken it in his (graceful, podium skipping) stride.   Anyway, I don't think there was any wrongdoing here by QT. They just got played. But its all part of the game.	14
0	It would, I'm sure many want to stay in the EU because they don't want the economy to suffer. A trade agreement would get round it, and so a poll including that option would show how many people found this issue 'the decider' and so arguments and discussions can be based around this.	14
0	I don't know, I guess its some crippling personality defect?	14
0	Animal right activist drawn towards anenvrionmental party with a stronger stance on animal rights/welfare than other parties. shocker	14
0	Do you have sympathy for someone who not only turned a blind eye to this awful abuse, but may have been directly involved?	14
1	There have been a few suicides that people have attributed to the stress caused by the tax - some people even left [notes](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/stephanie-bottrill-who-blamed-the-bedroom-tax-for-her-suicide-had-history-of-depression-inquest-hears-9664921.html) explicitly stating that the Bedroom Tax was the reason.  That said (as a Labour Party member) I don't think I would EVER bring this up in a political discussion. It is in exceptionally poor taste and we as commentators simply cannot know the  of the mental state of these people prior to their deaths.	14
1	What if the SNP don't whip? What if they grant a free vote?	14
1	Look upon our six vague ambigious ideas and be filled with awe!	14

0	Yeah, those damn uppity Scots should get back in their place.	14
1	It's going to be a shit 5 years to be poor  Or sick, or foreign, or a public sector worker	14
1	Also the more "wasted" votes that show up in statistics the better the argument for proportional representation.	14
1	I agree that Germany 'gets' federations, and does it well. France is pretty unitary though.	14
0	Depends what you define as major I guess, removing the bloated management seems like the right way to go.	14
1	77% of people want a significant reduction in immigration. Yet again we didn't have an audience that demonstrated this. While I found it astonishing that a man who came to the UK illegally, who was denied asylum/citizenship whichever it may be and had also been imprisoned, is still here in the UK illegally. Yet a significant number of people were clapping him.	14
0	Depends how well publicised this story is, really. So far i've only seen it on a few websites. The BBC haven't touched it, nor it seems have ITV or Sky. I wonder why.	14
1	The problem with NATO is that the Americans are rapidly losing interest in Europe relying on America to fight our wars for us. Look at Libya, regardless of how you feel about that effort there were problems like the EU lacking ammunition, awacs and tanker planes which meant that without the US we would have needed to stop after a few weeks.	14
1	He's dead right about the fishing laws set up by the EU. What a total joke that is.	14
1	It surprises me that this paper would support Labour, especially as they were the party that pretty much initiated everything that Snowden revealed about GCHQ etc.	14
0	They do not have the same numbers of users and engagement because mods of the now censored subreddits refuse to advertise them, preferring that users use their subs as they can dictate what opinions people are allowed to express and they are afraid users would flock to them if they knew about them.	14
0	Kek, same with anti UKIP activists I suppose, what with the assault they committed on that poor bloke?	14
1	&gt;Even the terminally ill have to have regular assessments.  That is barbaric.	14
0	If you've got artex or wood chip you should really vote UKIP	14
0	Going by the YouTube comments he might be saying 'no pasarán' and I'm hearing 'sassenach' through his thickest and broadest of Glaswegian accents.  Even if, then he's still saying you are not welcome and 'you shall not pass'.	14
1	I feel comfortable saying who I'm voting for, but I'm voting for Labour and I live in Liverpool, so that's not exactly a surprise.  I occasionally get a little stick when I say who I voted for last time (Lib Dems), but I can't say it overly bothers me. I agree with the general consensus that Tories and Ukippers get a harder time of it generally.	14
1	For all its faults the BBC is still a great institution that provides an alternative to the largely bland free-to-view content we get from the commercial channels.  The BBC is a trusted brand around the world and a great advertisement for Britain.  My biggest fear at this election is that the extremists get in and try to dismantle the BBC. That would be the most insane act of vandalism against something that has become part of British culture.	14
1	There was definitely a tendency to have more pro-Tory/UKIP posts a few months ago. And before that it was heavily pro-Green and even earlier pro-Lib Dem.  It does seem that as we have gotten closer to the election the Labour crowd have started popping out of the woodwork.	14
0	&gt;Neither of us have any idea how severe his condition is  Except that it was good enough for him to be voting on legislation 3 weeks ago.  &gt;would provide no remedy for the failures of the past.  So all those people who had their lives destroyed by this man should just stop whining then?	14
0	&gt;The overriding priority on 7 May is therefore, first, to stop the Conservatives from returning to government and, second, to put a viable alternative in their place.  Getting the Conservatives out of office is more important than having a viable alternative? So a worse performing government, as long as its not the Conservatives?  Wouldn't expect anything less from the Guardian.	14
0	basically this is a attempt to ring-fence anything that sounds good as a liberal democrat achievement and push any negative aspects on the conservatives.   Own your full voting history, not just the bits that might win you votes	14
0	I spent the majority of my time reading their manifesto, champ. I heard her speak once before that I think. Honestly I was not in a hurry to hear her speak again.	14
1	Your seat will stop being safe if the (on average) 40-60% of non-voters get off their arse and vote for someone else.	14
1	If they're intimidating voters, call the police, if they're just stood there with a sign, they have every right to be there.	14
1	No, but there aren't any pictures of Will eating a bacon sarnie on the front page of the Sun.	14
0	Just a bad apple...	14
0	The EU really needs to fix up, at the moment it's like a war to force us to stay in just because there's been talk of a referendum.	14
0	If people forget to reg, then they only have themselves to blame.    Don't get me wrong though, I am not an advocate of squatting.    How does this not happen with multinationals? Or does it?	14

0	You caught me out, that was a legitimate typo. I did mean 300,000 net a year but wrote day for some reason.   And if you read the definition of a far-right party you'll see that it word for word describes UKIP.   As for the rest I will counter later, I've run out of time for now.	14
1	One thing I like about UKIP is they do actually get rid of their idiots unlike the other parties	14
0	&gt;one of the only few sensible audience members  So the rest was just a bunch of idiotic liberal leftists.... who made absolutely stupid points and questions?  I also want to just add one small point. May be relevant, not necessarily in this example. Why for example Indian person could be against migration from the EU? One of these is that less of his Indian pals would come here. I'm not saying this is definitely a thing but at least should be considered, especially knowing that quite often it's a case that within certain communities they tend to help each other and be together.	14
0	Purge it with fire! Nothing more than a Machiavellian sophist Europhile. I can't stand that man.	14
0	Rather short sighted then, wasn't it? It makes you wonder how much foresight goes into other Labour plans.	14
1	Yeah like when he goes "he's disgusting..."why?"...."he's....DISGUSTING AND HAS NO MORALS" lol alright pal.	14
0	That is not Ukip policy.	14
1	They've lost a great statesman in William Hague. That guy has gravitas which the rest of the tories are sorely lacking.	14
1	UKIP sympathisers deciding not to be completely idiotic and just vote Tory, Green Party eating Labour votes. Large block of undecideds. Difficulty with bacon sandwiches.	14
1	When the UK non-government saves pounds, the UK government dissaves pounds. That's all a government deficit is - the non-government increasing their after tax holdings of pounds.  It typically happens in busts because that's when we need to save. The trick is to not fight it, to not run austerity budgets, as doing so can [stall growth](http://i.imgur.com/120WqrI.png).. and besides. It's not like the government is going to run out of pounds.	14
1	Because that was a promise he made if the Liberal Democrats won in 2010. They didn't. Not defending him on this, it just infuriates me how people don't understand that because not enough voted for him, he couldn't do everything he wanted. Just like i'm sure Cameron has been denied from doing shittonnes of things too.	14
1	A lot of white people are too comfortable/scared/lazy/insecure to fight for their own wellbeing. So they take the easy way out by achieving their satisfaction vicariously in the name of imaginary leftist causes and minority plight. Patronising and disgusting. The young do this almost religiously, it breaks my heart sometimes.	14
1	Mare Nostrum (counter productive), gender and racial equality legislation (patronising), LGBT rights (patronising), smoking in pubs (authoritarian). Just a little selection. I believe that people don't need to be told how to behave in this country to make a fair society.	14
1	The fact our reduced military spending means we're also not buying America's arms I'm sure doesn't come into it either.....  .... ofcourse if we renew Trident we'll be the best of friends again.	14
0	If you drive at a higher speed, you are increasing the chances of you, your passengers, and other drivers/car passengers/pedestrians being involved in accidents. That's why we have speed limits in the first place.	14
1	Going to  be even better 6 months in when some intern is sent out at 3am with a chisel.	14
1	There's no denying that UKIP will likely get at least 2-3 seats, I'm saying that as a Green Party member too. Cameron is a delusional idiot, in fact the "big two" are as equally useless as each other.  There's no excuse for a party with ~15% of the vote to only get 3 seats, that same can be said for the Greens, only 1-2 seats from 5-6% of the vote.  The only thing keeping Cameron in a job right now is FPTP. If the results of this election aren't a strong argument for PR then I don't know what is.	14
0	Your just reiterating tory spin, Labour didn't build call centers,  Labour didn't kill off our long dead manufacturing industry, and all parties and the majority of the public were actually happy with how the economy was going, if Labour did something to contribute to the recession it was in deregulating banks that allowed the UK financial sector to become vulnerable to the US mortgage bubble.  Also, having a low defecit does not equate to fast recovery from recession, look at Italy, they essentially borrowed and spent thier way out of recession and are now in better shape than before the crash.	14
1	I think it's all rather thrilling. I kind of want a period of stasis so that they actually talk to each other, or at least that something changes in how we do government.	14
1	This is why I hate Labour more than any other party	14
1	Well blow me down,a Tory with a thawed out heart.I wonder if he could spill the beans on that 12billion of cuts.	14

1	Of course an economy can run a deficit in perpetuity-all that needs to happen is for the debt to grow at the same rate as GDP and the debt to gdp ratio will be maintained.  You can do the numbers, but a deficit of 1-2% of GDP is perfectly sustainable	14

0	Only racists *and backwards immigrants* vote UKIP..?	14
1	Lets also remember though, that Iceland is much, much smaller in terms of population than the UK.  Its a comparable size to the population of Nottingham. (329,000 vs 310,000)  Not saying its a bad idea at all, but things have a habit of changing vastly when scaled up in terms of numbers.	14
1	Perhaps the question is: what is the problem with twitter?	14
1	I'd love them to gain Bristol West. More voices in parliament calling for PR.	14
1	Nobody does, not least George Orwell who said:  &gt;It would seem that, as used, the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless. In conversation, of course, it is used even more wildly than in print. I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, Social Credit, corporal punishment, fox hunting, bullfighting, the 1922 Committee, the 1941 Committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai-Shek, homosexuality, Priestley's broadcasts, Youth Hostels, astrology, women, dogs and I do not know what else.  It's just used as an evocative pejorative, in my case as to describe violent, authoritarian anti-democrats.	14
0	Twat he may be, but he's talking about actually dealing with the causes of immigration rather than just pulling a target out of his arse and painting "paki go home" on the side of vans.	14
0	Productivity is one form as is an increase in economic activity.  The UK got the increase in activity from adding more people. It wasn't a rise in income for the existing population.  Also that 4 million people need infrastructure, which of course requires spending.	14
0	So after all that we've got down to calling me racist then?  I answered all your questions in a genuine and honest way, I provided sources and links to where I was getting my information. I asked you to clarify things when I didn't understand what you were asking.   And all you can do is shut down discussion with the same old shit: "well you've got a bee in your bonnet about race" - End of chat.	14
0	The is nothing the UK can do to prevent climate change - since our emissions are so tiny (less than 2% of global CO2 output) - and wind turbines are essentially a scam to give rich land owners tax payers money.	14
1	Summer 2014:  UKpol right wing: Don't like what this place has become? Fuck off, then.  UKpol left wing: Ok.   Spring 2015  Ukpol left wing: Dont like what this place has become? Why not go elsewhere?  Ukpol right wing: Fuck off fuckface	14
0	No, but the majority of Scotland is voting for the SNP.	14
0	Or perhaps it was a near-isolated incident which you take personally because your brain isn't fully developed?	14
1	The joke behind these articles is that they fall over themselves try to claim - simultaneously - that money doesn't influence elections AND that restricting campaign spending does influence elections.  "How can I campaign for my favorite policies if I can't spend millions of dollars?"  "I don't know.  Maybe like the rest of us do, by actually pounding pavement with a clipboard and some personal charm?"	15
1	It's insufficient to show how much regulations cost. You have to also show how much it *would* have cost if those regulations did not exist. Regulations lubricate the infrastructure that facilitates a functioning economy.  That doesn't mean that *all* regulations are good or that the *current* regulations are good, but the fact that regulations impose a financial burden in certain ways is not sufficient to establish that they impose a financial burden *overall*.	15
0	I'll be really fucking confused and happy if it ends up Sanders v Paul.	15
0	&gt; They do certain sequences, but definitely not the whole genome  Right.  I assume they don't have the time or the technology to sequence the whole thing.  That said, I suspect the sequence considerably more than the specific information included on the report mailed back to the client, too, simply because it would be unnecessarily difficult not to do so.  &gt; Either way, data, in certain cases, should be treated like material objects.  That's not the argument I hear whenever folks on Reddit talk about software piracy.	15

0	&gt; What does the number of officers have to do with law enforcement approach in various areas?  I'm not sure I understand your question. It still feels like we're talking about two different things. Are you sure you understand just how much crime goes in cities like Detroit and Baltimore? When you're dealing with a significant percentage of people who are killers and robbers in an area, you're going to approach them differently than in areas where there are hardly any killers and robbers. Unless you think killers can be handled with kid gloves? I'm not sure I understand your point.	15
1	i dunno, i hear a lot more stories of black youths who have "never done nothing wrong to no one ever" in the last 8 yrs than before.	15

1	When you charge someone with a crime, they aren't guilty. It simply means there is significant evidence that they probably committed the crime. There's then a trial to determine whether they are actually guilty or innocent.   Innocent until proven guilty doesn't mean they can't be charged until convicted.	15

Look at Portugal. Drug related violence is down. They legalized all drugs.  Do you support banning alcohol? Drunk people are largely responsible for public assaults.  I see your argument faultering because you no longer are providing statements, but attempting to appeal to pathos.	15

1	Non violent offenders shouldn't be punished forever like that. It is just stupid and unfair. I mean obviously if someone gets arrested for something they do in a certain industry like running ponzi schemes they will get blacklisted from the financial industry and that is fair.     Treating someone like yourself or someone busted for pot like they carjacked or assaulted someone is just absurd though.    Rights shouldn't be violated for someone who has paid for their crime already and isn't a threat to society.	15
0	I hope you realize that I have no idea by what you mean.   You've insulted me to prove no point.    I'll stand up and say, I don't understand why you are so angry. Explain it to me, to be honest I'm not "particularly concerned" with you either.   Edit: are there not poor, huddled masses, refuse in America? I'm concern more about them than anyone trying to be immigrated, but when we take each other in, we have a responsibility, not self-responsibility, to each other...I proudly accept to be my brother's keeper. And that IMHO a is an American tradition.	15

1	We could (and should), but that won't magically give us health care. The US spends more than any other nation both on private and public care. If all care goes public, the costs will increase, because our single-payer system (VA) spends about 80% more per patient than private.   So even if you magically cut the military's budget in half, $350b/yr isn't close to the $1-2 trillion you need for government-funded healthcare.	15

1	&gt;At least you can admit that it's partially just about being a dick to Muslims for the sake of it.   Being a dick is a tactic. The goal was to expose the elements within the islamic community whose values are incompatible, a threat. Geller succeeded.	15
0	Maybe, I'm 100% against the drug war and would love to see it end. In the meantime, the residents of high crime areas deserve protection from the violent crime that occurs in their neighborhoods.	15

0	So they have not take the kids away and you are complaining. The thread is about too many removals. The thing we do know is that CPS is wrong.	15
1	This is why I love it when the IRS, or the DEA, or ICE, or NSA (shall I go on) announces a "policy change".  It doesn't mean shit.  Until the law is changed to remove the *potential* for abuse it will still go on.   This is why the libertarian principle of limited government is so important.  Power delegated will be abused.  Period. End of sentence.	15
1	All technically complex subjects develop jargon, and that is all 'legalese' is.  As long as there are laws there will be lawyers and legalese.	15
1	That sounds like labor union guys I've talked to.  "We need the entry level guys to make another 25 cents an hour."  *Why?*  "Because right now they're making less than minimum if you factor in their union dues!"	15
0	Free-speech has no limits.  This includes fighting words.  Constitutionally, congress can make no law, even against harrassment or threats.  Its why we have a civil court system, because if someone threatens me, i can sue them for loss of time, money, mental damage, whatever.	15

0	Ironically, this article was sourced out of Obama's own stimulus-auditing website.  We're not sure what the point of the article is (the '09 stimulus caused the '15 riots?), but it's clear that transparency at the executive level has been a real boon for investigative reporters.	15
1	&gt; from commies  You mean marxists.  Really, I know this subreddit has gotten a transfusion from /r/republican, but can we cut out the whole "Dirty Commies" circlejerk nonsense? Nobody says that anymore. It makes us look horribly simpleminded.	15

0	Looks like refusing profit on a cake just made them a few years of profit without any work, overhead, or labor.	15
0	In fairness no communist regime we have seen has been true communism.  Communism, in theory, cannot exist in real life.  It is completely incompatible with human nature.  Having everyone on perfectly equal standing would last all of 5 minutes before someone with a little more ambition than the average person takes more power.    EDIT: I don't know why you are downvoting me.  True communism (like true capitalism) exist only in theory.  Some places have gotten close to implementing them, but it hasn't worked out.  The closest I can think of pure communism is the USSR under Lenin, but that didn't last long.	15
1	If someone is attempting to destroy or rob me of my property, that is an act of aggression against me. It is perfectly lawful and moral to use an appropriate level of aggression to prevent that.	15
0	And labeling someone as a anti-semite, ace in the hole argument winner!	15
0	&gt;Believe it or not, communism isn't inherently evil.  Educate yourself. this is the most ignorant thing I have read on this subreddit for a very long time.  Just because you say you fight for good, doesn't mean you are. Communism is full of unintended consequences that go against freedom and prosperity big time.	15
1	&gt;doesn't sound coercive to anyone?  Who's doing the coercing, though? Certainly not the johns. She doesn't seem to have a pimp or madam who's coercing her. The landlord isn't coercing her.   "Circumstances" have certainly conspired to limit her options, but this is simply not equivalent to situations where people are **actually** forced into sexual slavery.	15
1	This is the expected result, and why libertarians oppose the laws that attempt to combat "discrimination".  It ends up with "everyone is equal just some people are more equal than others"   There is not factual or objective difference between a Christian refusing to back a cake for a wedding of 2 homosexuals, and this person refusing to put bibile verse on the cake.  Each business 100% has the right to refuse service however in this instance it seem the state will step in to force the Christian Baker to make a cake they do not desire to under the threat of violence but not use the same force on the baker refusing the bible verses....	15
0	At the same time, stop believing that everything you have is due to your efforts. Factors outside your control most probably shaped a lot of what you are.	15
1	No taxes on capital gains (I assume long and short term gain). I get the incentive to invest in companies, but good luck selling that to the public.  It will basically mean that the most wealthy will pay virtually no taxes at all. Make the flat tax 17% regardless of income you make whether though work or investments. It hurts my industry (accounting), but the benefits to the economy would be staggering.	15

1	My first thought exactly.	15
0	It is an empirical fact that almost every single minimum wage worker brings much more to the business than the wage that they make. As far as I know, this is a fact that cannot be denied. If you think otherwise, I would love to hear your rebuttal. I love hear differing viewpoints. But if you simply call anything you don't like "communism" and leave it at that then you are just going to reinforce my view that libertarians are wackos	15

0	&gt;Frankly, I'm a little shocked at the idea that folks on /r/Libertarian[1] want to give politicians the power to prosecute and convict someone for the crime of "being a defense attorney".  I have never seen a more perfect example of a strawman. You even put the end in quotes as if someone in this thread or article said those words literally.	15
0	&gt; even as a jew...  Color me shocked.	15
0	In scandinavia, the primary opponents to communists albeit not vocal ones, but the ones doing the fighting and telling them to shut the fuck up at shopfloors and factories have been ordinary workers.  Most of the people dieing in scandinavia fighting communism were not rich kids with trust funds. It was ordinary self-owning farmers and factory workers. Teachers. Government employees. Ordinary people.  you are severely deluded if you don't think a strong majority of the populace of western europe aren't against communism and socialism in it's more distilled formats or totalitarian formats.	15
0	Now that's a complete joke.  If the military, regardless of branch, gave a single fuck about the Constitution, then every politician who violates the Constitution would be forcefully removed from office by the military.  Instead, they suck the dicks of those corrupt politicians and obey their every command.	15

0	like I said, it's a "highly plausible", I myself don't cite it as the only change, nor assert that it is 100% true. You'd need to figure out ways to survey the former citizens, and get honest answers, control for variables, etc.	15
0	Well yeah, he was calling for end of capitalism while he was making millions on his documentaries, he was calling for disarming citizens while he was guarded by bodyguards 24/7.   It took him long enough to realize that guns are good, maybe next thing he'll realize free markets are good as well.	15
0	Legitimacy is, itself, a legal concept.  I mean, it's right there in the word, even.  Rights are a form of respect paid to you by others, specifically, other people that claim a degree of authority over you.  They don't come from nothing, and they aren't self-enforcing.  You're not born with rights.  You're not endowed with them.  They exist as a custom, a kind of tradition and taboo, and they vary extensively from culture to culture based on what the local community considers important.	15

0	Hi there RonPaul2012, how is your racist article writing going?	15
0	You are for sure on a list now. This giant data mining system they set up is to scoop up data on the people writing these kinds of comments. I bet they figure when this bitch starts to fall apart into chaos they can round everyone up who shows the slightest hint of intelligent resistance.	15
1	That creates a rather risky element of secrecy in the judicial process, though. The public has a right to know who is accused; otherwise, the courts can basically haul people off quietly. I'd rather a few of the accused be publicly embarrassed than make it easier to black-bag people.	15
0	&gt; Get on a step stool and say that again.  Sure.  **But then again, communists and socialist have never been intellectual giants.**	15
1	TIL: Neo-Liberal tolerance means that bigotry, prejudice, discrimination, racism and sexism are perfectly OK as long as the target is heterosexual, white and male.	15
0	&gt;I'm curious as to why the private funding dried up?  So am I. I thought that was supposed to be libertarians' bailiwick.	15

1	I agree with you.   In perfect egalitarianism not only factors like family must be taken away but IQ differences, attractiveness differences and just any difference between any individual.	15
1	I think the point the author is making is that once you've raised the minimum wage, the original worker loses his job to someone more qualified. So even though you can claim that you've increased the wage of the "food workers" category, those food workers are not the same people anymore, so you didn't really help the real flesh and blood people you were trying to help.	15

0	Yes they acted with too much force for what was necessary in this situation.....however, if he would have just stood up he could have avoided being turned into a chew toy by just obeying orders.  Then he could have sued them for the violation of his 4th amendment rights.  I have a friend in the local county sheriffs office that trains dogs....I dont care how guilty I am, I would never risk being attacked by one of those canines. They'll tear you up with a smile on their face and the deputy can't truly control them at times.  They could puncture your jugular in one bite and then you're fighting for your life.	15

0	What a mess. It's like reading *TZM: Defined*. The author keeps inventing his own terms or referring to obscure terms without defining them. There is really no reason to be this esoteric. It's frustrating to the reader.	15
1	Ummm, All of them. There is no government law or regulation not enforced at the end of a gun barrel.     Every time someone says "there should be a law/regulation" they are saying they are willing to send someone to threaten your life and put you in jail and destroy your livelihood if you do not obey.       Don't think so?  Try not following any of them and see what happens.    It may start out with a notice or a letter, but eventually there will be a gun pointed at you if you do not submit and comply.	15
1	The reason you perceive libertarians as emphasizing economic issues is because liberals argue against us more than conservatives, and their arguments are exclusively about economic issues.  Thus, we end up talking more about economic issues.  Your post is a perfect example of this.  I am talking about economic issues only because I am responding to your concern.	15

0	No, go back and read the comments if you've lost context.  I'm asking why you say "we need to give the benefit of the doubt to the government".  First, why is this a "we"?   Second, why do we need to give it to anyone at all?  Third, if it needs to be given to some group, then why is the government not automatically disqualified?  It's pretty fucking simple, stop trying to twist my words.	15
1	Because the situation is not due to bankers stealing money.	15

1	I don't think it's a conversation we're uncomfortable with -- and, in fact, I believe it's one we've had a hundred times over. You're in /r/Libertarian not /r/Conservative -- it's entirely clear to the majority of people here that, unfortunately, american society is littered with cops who are unable to divorce their personal prejudices and biases from how they do their jobs. That's one of the key reasons libertarians advocate for reforms to criminal justice and want to put an end to the laws that have racially disparate outcomes.	15
0	I personally don't believe in eliminating unpaid internships either, but I find it funny that people rally behind a minimum wage, but ignore violations of minimum wage, heavily abused by the upper class.	15
0	Do you even econometrics bro? The fact that it doesn't vary over time would make it easier, since you don't have the problem of autocorrelation. Besides which, I'm not sure what you mean by "doesn't vary," demographics change all the time.	15
1	Yes, please continue.	15
0	Actually the City of Seattle does have the right to tell you what you can charge for your labor while you are on city property. Don't like it, don't do business in Seattle, or use the democratic process to change the law.	15

But it may be an oversimplification, and a surprisingly emotional one on the part of Chomsky here.  Kind of surprised as his lack of self control when engaging.  Ruthless and aggressive and is no manner in which to begin a dialogue in earnest.	15
1	That's a shame, but not shocking.  The Austrian school is largely regarded as a joke in economic circles.  Here in the US, there only a handful of universities that embrace the Austrian school of thought.  I'm glad this guy spoke up and is it at least shining a light on the selection process.	15

1	Of course.  When people who are in favor of a ridiculously high minimum wage end up in a situation where it directly affects them, they'll always come up with excuses as to why it shouldn't apply to *them*, but everyone else needs to pay their "fair share".  I actually heard someone argue that the minimum wage should be raised to $15/hour, but small businesses should be exempt from having to pay it.  This person is (obviously) a small business owner.	15

1	I wouldn't have guessed your nationality from your name (hah), but yeah there is a lot of pressure inside of the police to get bigger numbers when it comes to arrests and on prosecutors to get convictions whether or not they think the person is innocent to bolster their record as an attorney There is less of an emphasis on making sure that there is due process and more on getting better numbers so that the person can advance their career.	15

0	&gt; The existence of one cotton mill following a 5 day week before Ford doesn't undermine the claim that Ford pioneered and popularized it.  Why are we to conclude that Ford was the popularizer and not the popularizee?  We have steady advocacy for shorter working hours and shorter working days, going straight back to the 1840s, but you've fixated on Henry Ford for reasons I can only speculate upon.	15
0	One writer's opinion doesn't infer on the entire media, nor the populace. Blacks are so far away from being privileged. It sucks being black. People look at you different, think of you different, they act different. There is no way around that.	15
0	Democrats and Republicans want oppression.  People like you who blindly worship those who murder for politicians and insist that removing corrupt politicians from power is immoral / unconstitutional want oppression as well.  Just remember though, the boots you lick today will kick your teeth in tomorrow.	15
0	&gt;My point wasn't about their relative probability. My point was that something can happen and yet it's possible to exaggerate the likelihood of it occurring.  That isn't what's happening here though. I've already posted info here about blasphemy/apostasy laws, and public opinion polls from the middle east showing how many support this kind of repressive nonsense.   You can't seriously be suggesting these problems and mindsets aren't pervasive in a disturbingly high percentage of the islamic world? Or are you?   Why would you run to the defense of or try to whitewash such violent, oppressive, illiberal behaviors?	15
0	Do you think the crime of rape is worse than property damage?   Edit: Have you attempted to break the sentences down, maybe, make smaller sentences? Maybe, you'll recognize phrases with that method?  I dunno, if you're literate I don't see how a point could have been made any more blunt.	15
1	Agreed. They are not discriminating against Christians. They are refusing to conduct private transactions with businesses that discriminate against gays. Christianity is just the excuse some businesses use.   To turn this into a religious discrimination argument is a serious stretch.   The former business, under the guise of religion, has chosen to single out gay people. Kind of an immutable trait.   The latter business is singling out other businesses that have discriminatory policies.   Outside of the argument of whether businesses should be prevented by law from the former type of discrimination, the argument here is apples to oranges.	15

1	Pam Geller most definitely shouldn't shut up. This isn't about being a dick to muslims for the sake of it; this is about exposing an enemy that has values and beliefs that are completely incompatible with western civilization. And Geller has done a magnificent job of showing the country who they are.   Unfortunately, I think Americans have largely failed this test, as I've seen numerous people take the blame off of where it belongs - directly and 100% on the islamists - and put it on Geller.  I hope she stays safe and carries a firearm.	15

1	There's no logic with these people (anti-gun liberals). They're just too stubborn and ignorant to look into why gun control is a bad thing for everyone and I doubt they will ever change. I bet many of them don't even know why the 2nd amendment is in the bill of rights.	15

0	In don't think you really said anything here. You made a counter statement and left it hanging. You didn't disprove the previous comments assertion.

0	&gt; It's pretty damn hard to be more against the idea of small government by doing this.  The gov't *not* banning property owners from doing something is not a sign of big gov't.  It *is* small gov't.  If there's any proper role for state gov't, it's to limit city and county gov'ts.  Likewise, the only proper role of the federal gov't is to limit the state gov't, and the constitution limits the feds.	15

0	I have yet to fucking hear how Probable Cause to  for the initial detainment was established (as  eye contact &amp; running is not probable cause)-- that fact, being void, alone proves culpability as Gray would still be alive had his rights been upheld.    That being said, you're right they're still innocent. They also happen to have a fuck ton of evidence (video, as one piece) against them.	15
1	Voluntary socialism (communism) is totally libertarian (anarcho-capitalist), because if people decided to commonly share ownership of their property, they could do that. Though this system would not be economically sustainable - but that's not my problem. If people wanted to go bankrupt, it's no my busineess to intervene; but also I wouldn't join the commune, as I'm too used to private property.  The thing is, there could be communist enclaves inside anarcho-capitalist country, but not the other way round.	15
1	Nothing substantive will get done about this. This is just a part of the campaign to get police to be federalized.	15

1	Libertarians have to understand most people don't believe in ideology or hold to some dogmatic principal like the non-aggression principal. They look at laws in a very utilitarian way, do benefits of a certain law outweigh the costs? When you look at it that way there is no contradiction or hypocrisy in supporting some laws while opposing others.	15

1	That's the thing, you are 100% correct. It's completely cut-and-dried, and what you are citing is perfectly valid. Snowden did nothing wrong; he did a wonderful and heroic thing for the people of America.  The problem is that the people are doing a terrible job of holding the government's nose to the paper. We should be reminding government every single day they we own them, and not the other way around.	15

0	You are supporting people not being able to speak their minds out of fear. Plain and simple.  We have a group of people trying to silence a message that one person is trying to say in public. The group is using the threat of violence to stop the person exercising their right to free speech. Your only argument is that she is immature and provoking the violent group.  Complacency in the name of fear, is compliance. Have fun complying with violent religious nut jobs....lol	15

1	Lol look around you. If you don't see it, you're probably part of it.  Obviously people are a little less ignorant today, but with respect to the available information (more now than then), the level of close mindedness hasn't changed much. It's a human condition, rooted in self bias. Everyone has it to varying degrees. It's just easy too see how close minded the average person was 30 years ago because things have shifted. They will be saying the same thing about us in 40 years.	15

Can you seriously not agree that [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Mill_Children_in_Macon_2.jpg) is bad and that some employee protection laws are good and necessary?      I love this sub, and I'm all about civil liberties, but it seems like some of you guys take it a bit too far economically.	15
1	It's a private business. If they don't want to permit campaigns for religious conservatives, so what?	15
0	Then why are you here?	15
1	No, that's exactly my point. Those things aren't really related to being Libertarian. Climate change has nothing to do with the NAP. "Liberals" are no more socialist than the vast majority of "conservatives".  And yet, those statements are commonly found in this subreddit.	15
0	&gt;Global warming has not met these burdens,   So then why not just say "I don't know if it's true?" What makes you convinced it's false?	15
0	&gt; Cities should be free to decide if they want fracking in their jurisdiction  No, they shouldn't.  It's just as simple as that.  Because to make that choice violates the property rights of others.  &gt; The state is overstepping it's authority by banning cities from banning fracking  They are neither overstepping it's authority in the real world, or in a libertarian minarchist world/  &gt; One of the tenants of the "small government" idea is to try and get large legislatures out of the affairs of smaller ones as much as possible, or so I thought.

0	&gt; her statement is a parrot of the statements made by Rand during the Ferguson riots  Which is a parrot of Jesse Jackson's 1984 Presidential Campaign. But for some reason, you didn't take note of it when Jackson and Rev. Sharpton were saying it. Now that it spills out of Rand Paul's mouth, though...	15
0	Zing!  Any more?  I'm sure you've got more.	15
0	TIL that using facts and not fearmongering is drinking Koolaid	15
1	We need to get rid of qualified immunity. If a cop is properly doing his job and acting within the law, they wouldn't need qualified immunity to begin with.	15
0	Were the police paralyzed in Baltimore when six officers were brought up on the murder of Freddie Gray?  Were they paralyzed in Ferguson after the Michael Brown slaying?  I don't think you understand how the system operates.  Lawsuits take years - if not decades - to resolve.  The only people paralyzed are the plaintiffs.	15

0	I agree. There are some real kooks here.	15

1	Obama could stop this shit today, but he doesn't. Every one of these cops works for him, but he does nothing. He gets a complete pass from the media and every statist on the left and right. The Democrats have zero credibility on this.	15
1	We can fix this terrible problem.  Just send them to war.	15
1	In case you guys haven't received the memo, there's a new site called [Voat](https://voat.co/) that is similar to Reddit.  Many of the anti-SJW (/r/TumblrInAction /r/KotakuInAction /r/fatpeoplehate)  subs have already got some sort of a set-up over there.  It's where most people I talk to are going to go once it goes full SJW crazy here.	15

0	It is free. As free as the roads I drive on, the school system I attended, and will send my kids to. As free as national defense, of which I have the opportunities that I do, under.  I don't hear you screaming that the roads aren't free. What's the difference?  But if you really want to get into semantics and splitting hairs, then how about the fact that we already subsidize healthcare for the uninsured we just do it in the stupidest way possible, through emergency room visits.	15
1	This is exactly it. People blindly voting only along party lines have the balls insult how others determine who they vote for.	15
1	Yes, they do.	15
1	Do we need Bush 2.0 I don't think so!	15
0	Of course you're in denial of this.	15
0	OP you should've first made a post asking what socialism means. Every top level post in here thinks it means something different. Of course they all argue against their own strawman	15
0	I didnt ask you.	15
1	Because you only have the right to free speech as long as most everyone agrees with you.   The downside of free speech is that people can say whatever they want, and it isn't always what everyone wants to hear. But the beauty of free speech is that everyone can say whatever they want, even if it isn't what everyone wants to hear.   All of these politicians should probably read our constitution.	15
0	No, not communist. Communist is a rather specific term. I understand how it is "useful" in the U.S. to use commie as a propaganda term.	15
0	read what i posted, that's my contribution. and do i need to be a libertarian to respond to a shitty meme picture that looks like all the other shitty meme pictures at first glance when i'm rolling down the line of shitty meme pictures.  fuck you	15
0	Hillary would go to war with Russia and China, because she needs to prove to the world that she has balls.	15
0	You can't by a VA plan in NC.  You can only by a plan that complies with the regulations in your state.  Now you're lying and I'll already proved it.  Read the articles I posted and you won't feel so silly.	15
0	Condescending bitch who assumes everyone in the country is fucking stupid.  Can't believe she's even being considered by anybody.	15
0	&gt;By **my** definition a government is nothing more than a power-hungry organized that seeks to further its own ends and is highly susceptible to corruption.  FTFY  So, you're objection is purely due to your preexisting biases and has no actual merit. Glad we cleared that up.	15
1	Or just eliminate 75% of them, they are superfluous and unneeded.	15
0	I'm not surprising its getting attention. I just don't understand what I'm supposed to be upset about. Your post didn't illuminate much for me in that regard.	15
0	you should have left the original title alone because now you just look stupid.	15
0	I'll stick to the evidence.	15
0	I should have been more specific. I meant they were good only when they weren't talking about politics and you'd never know something was wrong with them.  The ones I know are happy with looting of CVSs, burning of retirement homes, and slashing of fireman hoses. They pretty much support any crime as long as it suits their political agenda.	15
0	It's all right. I pardon you.	15
0	Right now the front page has an MSNBC link, an NBC link, a WSJ link, and a  FoxNews link. Looks pretty diverse to me.  Why don't you show up and complain the next time we get a MotherJones, Kos, HuffPo, or ThinkProgress link on here, which we do.  Oh, right, because you're a flaming DNC party hardliner here to  shill for Democrats and concern troll over a story from national review that *starts with a critique of the Tea Party for fucks' sake.*	15
1	Jesus, how do you get to the point where you are intentionally using a dog to bite a man lying on the ground, not fighting back?  Another question, did the victim die from blood loss / due to the bites? It is not clear from the article, the cops claimed he was sent for medical treatment due to "respiratory distress" but it doesn't mention anything about a specific cause of death.	15
0	A woman has a cartoon contest and two lunatics fueled by evil ideology show up with machine guns to kill scores of people and "we don't need to be afraid of them?" There isn't some "imminent" threat? In case you haven't heard, this isn't a thought experiment, it *really happened*.   If this incident doesn't prove there is indeed something evil afoot in this country, what would?	15
1	Life´s not fair. The sooner you get used to that the better.  Some are born tall others short, some attractive others unattractive, Some smart some stupid, some with parents who love them some with parents who hate them, some rich some poor  STOP WHINING AND GET OVER IT! BE HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU DO HAVE AND USE THAT TO FURTHER YOUR POSITION INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT WHAT YOU DON¨T HAVE AND TAKING THAT AS AN EXCUSE FOR NOT BEING IN YOUR IDEALISED POSITION.	15

0	Shut up. Go to bed, you have school tomorrow. If you aren't going to think like an adult, then get the fuck out.	15
0	If you don't support this, you're clearly not interested in the good of the individual *or* society, and are merely an apologist for corrupt, massive, and all-powerful government.  And therefore are either a complete moron or utterly corrupt yourself.	15
0	Your speculation is useless.	15
0	Props go out to Paul, but he needs to look more presidential if he wants to win the election. Looks like an old frat boy.	15

1	They didn't bother to erase the video because they know they will not be held accountable despite the video. It's good to be the kings.	15
1	That's different.  Al Gore is a statist liberal fat jerk.  ManBearPig.	15
0	I would think that these people would be held to even a higher standard....but that's just me.  All you all must think we need corrupt motherfuckers in office. lolz.  We need a guillotine.	15
1	The "constitutional lawyers" love that word- unreasonable.  It's so open to interpretation that they can justify anything.	15
0	Teargas is. Do you have trouble with reading?	15
0	I look at her about how I look at Westboro Baptist. She's trolling IRL, and I believe she has an underlying goal of making Muslims (I mean all Muslims here) seem violent and extremist.  She wants an anti-Muslim sentiment in America, IMHO.	15
1	I'm hoping for no dynasty extensions this election	15
0	&gt;A Gay Couple is sueing a business to force them to provide services to them under the "anti-discrimination" laws.   The state is fining the company. The couple is not suing the business.	15

0	Do it for the Supreme Court Justices she will elect that say billionaire's money does not = free speech.

0	"Rookie" implies major leagues.   Sorry I had to explain that to you.	15
1	Well, remember that when election time rolls around.	15
1	I understand their logic, however nonsensical it is.  They think he's making a mockery of the people who got killed by police, even though he's literally doing the exact opposite of that by protesting individuals' right to own weapons to defend themselves against the police.	15
1	That is really taking  a statement out of context. Did you honestly not understand what was being said?  When you say retail workers are now being paid 15$ an hour, that does not mean that the same flesh and blood people are being employed as before when they made less.  So when people say "retail workers" they are not referring to the same people necessarily.	15
1	It's usually the same for any emotionally driven position.  You can show them all the documentation, statistics, and facts in the world, and nothing is going to change their position.  They have a narrative in mind, they have a statistic that proves their narrative [who cares that it's based upon faulty data?], so who's got time to rehash the facts?  It's onwards and upwards, no time to look back to make sure we got it right!	15
1	What's so special about a judge? They are forced on you by elections, or placed by politicians. They are horrible people who exercise arbitrary power in tyrannical fashion and, as shown here, have the power to make demands and control their courtrooms like fiefdoms--they have tyrannical control over their courtroom. In what other slice of life can a person make demands like this? Only that of an owner over his property, and judges do not own their courtrooms. In a publicly-owned courtroom, they should have to live by free speech.	15
0	What the US was founded on... AKA the greatest appeal to authority there is.  The US was also founded on slave labor and stealing a continent from the Native Americans. Thankfully, things change. I.E., no more slaves. We're keeping the continent though, because we kinda need it.	15
1	&gt; In Chicago, which has the country's second biggest fleet with roughly 7,000 taxis, the median sale price for a medallion hovered around **$70,000 in 2007** before reaching a median sales peak of $357,000 in late 2013.  &gt; Since reaching that high point more than a year ago, the value of medallions in the Windy City have sharply declined and sales have ground to a near halt—with the city recording only seven medallion transfers in the **first quarter of 2015—as the median sale price fell to about $270,000**.  So something that's selling for 385% of what it was in 2007 is "unsellable"?	15

1	McConnel's anger gave me a quarter-chub.  I hope this doesn't go through..	15
0	&gt;People who truly understand business and economics know that it may be quicker and easier to scam people, but the real fortunes are made by offering real value.  Righttt...because most famed economists and intellectuals are pushing for government deregulation and a move towards a complete market economy...you mustve been asleep when the world of economics was turned upside down by piketty, or missed any of the inequality work being done by chetty     Ffs.	15
1	Yeah, but it sure sounds like they're leaving the door wide open for Congress to retroactively legitimize it. :/  &gt;“In light of the asserted national security interests at stake, we deem it prudent to pause to allow an opportunity for debate in Congress that may (or may not) profoundly alter the legal landscape,” the judges ruled.	15
0	I will never work with someone who wants to steal money from my pocket. It would be stupid.	15
1	With his past positions and professional ties, alone, he shouldn't be moderating.	15
1	That doesn't mean it's moral to steal your kids away from you, because you forgot (didn't want) to send some paper.	15
1	That title isn't much different.	15
0	I have a problem with any discrimination. My preference is that everyone can separate the personal from the professional.	15
1	Ron Paul opposed it.	15
1	Once you serve the sentence, the debt to society is considered payed.   I don't see how you can lose your right when they are god given. You lose them when you are in prison serving a sentence for crimes, once that is over you should be a free man.	15
1	The last time I took a flight and my friend had a TSA agent's hand down her pants. Any more brain busters?  Why don't you ask the citizens of New York that question after they've been "stopped and frisked".	15
0	it is not verifiable that the police knew that criminals had set the fire before they investigated who set the fire (unless they are referring to themselves, as noted elsewhere in this thread).   "alleged", "witnesses say", or any other hedge words would have helped them here, but lacked ideological punch. thus, they chose to go with this propaganda.	15
0	&gt;Christianity is just the excuse some businesses use.   These people have served gays before. Including the couple that gave them a hard time. They're not looking for an excuse to not serve gays, and shame on you for suggesting otherwise.  Just because you disagree with someone doesn't mean you can misrepresent them. That's a liberal tactic, but it's not an honest one.	15
0	Yes it is. Courts assign responsibility all the time, and it adds up to 100%.	15
0	Oh I know exactly what it is. Hell, I used to be a "constitionalsit" before I realized that it didn't prevent anyone in government from doing anything they wanted.   It's a worthless piece of paper is what it is.	15
1	Cruz won't because he's a sell-out.	15
1	He should claim that 50K as prepayment of any taxes he owes in the future.	15
0	i'm being trolled  and i'm not a libertarian  and you're dumb	15
0	Considering the adrenalin that must have still been pumping through his system, he probably wasn't thinking clearly anyhow... and tack on the fear that the robbers might come back at any time.... 99% of people wouldn't have put the gun down until the police arrive.  It's 100% the officers fault. They are the ones that get trained in how to deal in situations like this (we hope).	15
1	Really?  You're really going to put Obama on the same level as Rand Paul?  Yeesh.	15
0	Well, we disagree.  It happens.	15
1	Same thing with Baltimore, liberals seem to think the solution is always throw more money at it, that's not how it works.	15
0	So you don't believe in the freedom of speech, good to know.   Now fuck off, statist.	15
1	it's like deja vu all over again!	15
0	Is there any other kind of fascist?	15
0	Nice. I actually new that, damnit.. There's just such a strong association to Seth Rogan.	15
1	So, how do we get this to apply in the Peoples Republic of NYC?	15
1	I from illinos so i unterstand ya wes broke here too.	15
0	Who has ever said "only"?	15
0	In what way is he a pretender?	15
1	Freedom of speech includes and encompasses the freedom to offend and be offended. You cannot hold onto one without also defending the others.	15
1	It's funny that I never thought Bowling For Columbine was anti-gun, but it was anti-hystaria. Because he did make it a point to say that nations with higher gun ownership than America, don't have the same murder rates.	15
0	Every single person is a potential nutjob with a gun. If they were so easy to identify, this wouldn't happen.	15
1	Woah don't bring literal definitions into this fight! We are talking politics not facts.	15
1	This is actually very true. I work for an insurance company and in training we study these kind of things. Loggers, fishing, airplanes, electrical contractors, construction, roofing.. are all much, much more dangerous.	15
1	My amazing senator lindsay graham there rolling his eyes... :P	15
0	So no real actual counter point. See this is proof that you aren't a libertarian, your probably more so a disgruntled Republican too. A and really you just seem like a big baby. Good to know.	15
1	Or Paul will get elected and it's just business as usual. Honestly sometimes I wonder if the president is just for appearances, like the Queen. No real power, controlled by the true powers behind the scenes. Obama sure pulled a huge 180 on a lot of things he spoke very passionately about. Then there is the whole assassination thing that typically follows politicians who speak out against the system. I dunno, I feel like a tin foil hat crazy person sometimes, but how else am I supposed to make sense of this bullshit?	15
1	The 2012 [median salary for athletes and sports competitors](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/athletes-and-sports-competitors.htm) was 40K.  Professional athletes make up an [incredibly tiny portion of the population](https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/Probability-of-going-pro-methodology_Update2013.pdf), only several times larger than Congress itself.  As for the salaries of Congresscritters, that's left for themselves to decide; their monetary considerations are usually much greater through the visibility of their positions (ie. writing books or speaking) or through their post-congressional employment (ie. consulting, litigation, lobbying, etc).	15
1	going home for the weekend is more important than the debate over the rights of 300+ million people.  that sounds like the attitude of a bureaucrat, to me.	15
1	It wouldn't be the first time. Someone has to fuck with the Bernie Sanders circlejerk, and I have nothing better to do at the moment.  It actually has 4 upvotes at the moment.	15
1	That black guy is fucking brave.	15
1	Sounds like it's not actually a filibuster.  But, point of order, can't he tag-team with somebody else?  Also, the 'not a true filibuster' articles haven't really gone into *why* it's not... Or what he would have to do for it to be a filibuster.	15

0	Most religions go hand and hand with fanatacism.	15
0	Reason courting the /r/PussyPass base. Nice. At least they're in tune with their demographic.  If Hillary loses, it's because she's a horrible person. If she wins, it's because she's a woman!  ~~2008 2012~~ 2016  This politician won for no other reason than they have ~~lots of melanin~~ a vagina!!  This sub has collectively become Karl Rove sitting in the Fox studios on election night 2012	15
0	I see what you're talking about. I didn't realize you were talking about with the current legal restrictions. I thought you were talking about if the government wasn't preventing the voluntary exchange.	15
1	"I know not all cops are bad..." This is a hard pill to swallow for me. If there were good cops they would arrest the bad cops. When was the last time you heard of that happening?	15
1	She offered to have them interviewed with her attorney present.  Does that count?	15
1	I can just picture Droopy's jowls flapping with rage :)	15

0	Conspiracy theories and persecution complexes are so boring.	15
1	&gt;I think the commenter assumed you were Jewish because you're circumcised.  Fuck that's racist. It's because of his schnoz.	15
1	Yeah ruin the sanders party they are having    Trying to create a United States of Scandinavia	15
0	It needed to be said. Sometimes this subreddit turns into such a mindless circlejerk it makes me want to scream. Nothing is about absolutes.	15
1	I want to say it was Dan Carlin, right before the '12 election, that if he HAD to choose between Romney or Obama he would vote for Romney, simply because at least then there would be some backlash from Dems against bad foreign-policy and abuse of executive authority.	15
0	&gt;IMO  You opinion isn't very libertarian.	15
0	ZOMG their economy didn't implode!!!   Business went on as usual!!!!   That must mean,  those people crying the end of the world over a minimum wage hike, might be full of shit.    Lets wait and see what massive tax cuts do to stimulate the economy in Kansas and we'll have another data point...  oh wait	15
1	&gt; I've even heard the term "citizen" being used to describe non-police. That one really confuses me.  In their world, "Citizens" have limited rights and are subjects of the oligarchy. The oligarchy's enforcers have elevated rights and near-immunity from prosecution.  When I think of police and the power they're granted, I always remember this scene from Braveheart:  http://i.imgur.com/4Vt75ba.jpg  I know not all cops are bad...but the power &amp; immunity they wield is far to great.	15
0	https://youtu.be/SuTjzYGaQb8  Troops are the trigger pullers, or in the case of the holocaust, the gas chamber operators. Hitler, Stalin, Bush, Cheney et al never killed anyone; the mindless dipshits "just obeying orders" did that.	15
0	"The researchers did not find evidence that the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing had contaminated any of the wells they tested..."  I'm sorry, you were saying?	15
1	Saying we are oppressed citizens is not delusional. I call intercepting huge amounts of data transmissions to spy on its citizens pretty damn oppressive. And I'm not comparing Snowden to George Washington, I'm comparing him to anyone who has ever put himself in harms way to promote the good of the general public.	15
0	It may not create the tax code, but it certainly does more than enforce the tax code.  They also selectively utilize the tax code to bludgeon administration opponents.	15
1	If the government was only collecting metadata, it could all be stored in a 12 x 20ft area [source: William Binney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-y2qtpXP8E#t=22m11s). Buildings with 100,000 square feet of storage space like the Utah Data Center would be unnecessary if all the government was doing was storing metadata.	15
0	&gt; In a free society I think you're likely to get a lot of successfully commonly owned properties.  Which isn't socialism per se. When critics talk about socialism, they are talking about a system where private ownership of the means of production is outlawed and economic planning is relegated to a single group of committees, syndicates, ect.  Worker owned businesses can be successful capital arrangements and can be organized in complete harmony with other businesses in the free market. That cannot be said for private businesses under socialism.	15
1	Does Texas have some group that better trained and organized on call to moniter this?  No?  Sometimes you really need a wrench but all you have is some vice grips so you make due.	15
0	Aside from the jokes made at your expense, the one thing that's consistent about libertarians, no matter which continent you fucks are on, is the ever-present stench of racist dogma just below the surface of your ridiculous free-market worship.   Totally not a cult though, right?	15
0	&gt; How depressing. If Hilary gets into office, you can say goodbye to gender equality.  If they pass net neutrality, you can say goodbye to the internet!  If they pass the minimum wage, you can say goodbye to small business!  Fuddy McFudderson just fuddin some fud.	15
0	I got banned from there for being a spammer because I posted most of my links from reason... at a rate of less than one a month!	15
0	Yeah I guess libertarians don't realize that they hate these people because they aren't white men.    Or are we supposed to believe the fact that libertarians are 95% white and 70% male is a coincidence lmao?	15
1	Every time i hear about one of these cases it just pisses me off.  How long are we going to allow the government to steal peoples money like this?  People should be protesting this crap far more.	15
0	Sorry your business was too shitty to pay your employees reasonably.  Maybe take the time off to no longer be such a fat neckbeard?	15
0	&gt; Sure it is. Swap "god" for "the state" and there you go.  Dumb answer.  Who the fuck worships the state like they do a god.	15
1	&gt;anti Keystone activists are just towing Warren Buffett's line.  And that is why America is shit.  "It is wrong, but they are wrong so they deserve it."	15
0	&gt;Well I recall Ron Paul saying at one point that pointing them out and saying they couldn't have what everyone else was having would only lead to issues  "Issues" like what? The only "issue" I see is Iran would be unable to nuke anyone, which seems like a good thing.	15
0	like 0.0001% of americans feel oppressed. Where is the real oppression?   Also, of the things that Snowden revealed, which of those things actually oppressed anyone? Name me a person who was oppressed by having their phone calls logged by the NSA. You can't.	15

1	It's not okay for anyone, even police, to touch you without your consent. Police have an exception carved out for specific situations which precede an arrest, such as acting violently toward others or when serving a warrant--neither of which apply here. This was a stop and frisk without cause and he was getting handsy with her.	15

0	&gt; coercion  First, coercion is in the eye of the beholder. A geolibertarian thinks all privately held land is enforced by coercion.  &gt;but doing so through coercion is no way to accomplish that.  Second, doing so through coercion is definitely a way to accomplish that. It may not be your favorite way, but it may be the one that works the best.	15
1	If the TOS indicated that you were selling your DNA to the company for whatever purpose they see fit, you are right.  If the TOS indicates that your DNA will not be shared with law enforcement without a warrant then you'd be wrong.  I haven't read it, so I don't know. I certainly wouldn't give them my DNA without reading it.	15

1	I almost didn't get through the video.  Partly because of that woman's shrill voice and the fact that one guy wasn't letting him walk.  Seriously...	15
0	And how far forward would the election of a Republican President set feminism?  I'm going to take a guess and say not very.  And this idea that she's some radical feminist isn't really reflected in reality at all. So I don't really know what the problem is here.	15

1	It's a hyper free trade agreement where corporations can sue member nations for profit loss from regulations. It's every corporatist's wet dream.  Imo, a great way to handle immigration concerns as well, as there will be more American jobs moved overseas.	15

The rich make $1 more than you and should be super taxed, and you're always middle class, and it's always someone else's fault why you aren't richer and you made yourself not poor.  Basically, humans are utter shitbags when not 'forced' by the rules of nature to survive/become better/be at their best or die off.	15
1	It's called a twentieth-trimester abortion.	15
1	Texas is actually the perfect case study in the dangers of crony capitalism and government corruption. Their state is overrun with oil barons, good old boy networks, and all sorts of industry favoritism designed to keep competition from interfering with entrenched power and oil fortunes. This is the state that's been home to criminal corporations like Halliburton and Enron. These guys are masters at controlling politicians and driving fair competition out of the market. There's nothing "free" about Texas unless you have the right state power boys in your back pocket.	15

1	Yeah, in the house. He lost the presidential election all 3 times he ran. Rand Paul, though he holds pretty much the same ideas as his father, is smart enough to tailor his message so as to palatable in the presidential election.  If he started spitting fire like Ron did, he wouldn't stand a chance.	15

1	I'm not a fan of /r/politics by any means, though they haven't banned me like /r/conservative has.  That being said the two top posts right now in /r/politics (sorted by best) are "Rand Paul Filibusters Patriot Act Renewal" posted 7 hours ago and "Rand Paul begins Senate 'filibuster' in bid to end NSA spying – live" posted 6 hours ago.  The fifth post is "(Rand) Paul Begins Patriot Act Filibuster".  And the nineteenth is "Rand Paul Filibusters Patriot Act Renewal".	15
0	What an idiot. He should have answered the door when the police knocked. He should have stood up when the police told him to stand up. He knew what would happen when the cop said "I'm going to release the dog". He's lucky it didn't go for his nuts.	15

0	I think I see what you are trying to say. The thing is you can easily lower your own salary to be fair to those beneath you while taking the extra and reinvesting into your company. If the normal employee makes $15,000 a year but you can not raise their pay to $20,000 without hurting the company then maybe you shouldn't make over $60,000 and take that extra $940,000 a year and make the company more profit so you can pay both your employees and yourself more.	15
0	It's about trade-offs. If a company can make an extra 10K hiring the 50th employee, but will lose 15K at the same time, it's obviously not worth the added productivity.	15
1	Yeah, and the licensed restaurants/bars/clubs have to buy from the state. And finally, importation by anyone other than the state is a crime. So not only are they a monopoly, but you're legally restricted to the selection of products that are approved and sold by the state.	15

0	You plainly stated that,"no one is trying to stop her".  So either, you are so ignorant that you believe that lie, or you are trying to glaze over the facts. Either way you seem to be more concerned with people drawing cartoons than pedophile cultists who want to squash free speech with violence.  It amazes me to see you liberals embracing islam.

Great minds ignore fraudulently hidden foreign donations to a Secretary of State busted for violating record keeping and public transparency laws red handed. Small minds talk about it.

1	Civil forfeiture is awesome! I love it when the government decides to fuck over it's citizens with laws that should never have been passed.  I would like all the senators and congressmen's bank accounts to be seized. Let's have them prove that they acquired all their money legally. What is good for the goose is good for the gander.  But no, they would actually retaliate against those that would expose their corruption.	15
1	You mean bad cops and bad cops? If they are willing to let their buddies commit crimes they are willing to ignore their job at a whim, to the detriment of others. This is not 2 categories because its similar to a getaway driver being charged for robbery when he didn't literally rob someone. If you are allowing, encouraging, and facilitating illegal behavior you are guilty of it yourself.	15

Not sure what I would do if the officer tried to take my phone by force...	15

0	&gt; You miss my point. If Hillary wins the primary, she will win the election.  No I didn't. You said Rand has little to no chance of beating Hillary, and then suggest the alternative route of Bernie beating her which is even *less* likely.  Of course, I could be underestimating him, but I don't think so.	15
0	10 kids seems a bit much to be able to properly unschool them.  I would like to know what skills or knowledge the kids actually learned to see if they are making good progress.  However if the interests of the kids is really the case it would have been more tactfull to at least talk and mediate with the parents possibly through the home / unschooling community.  There are less heavy handed methods to solve problems.	15

Government has been proven time and time again they can not be trusted, so unless the government wants to release publicly the evidence they have of abuse,  I will assume this is a happy loving family that had the misfortune to be subject to an oppressive government and their immoral agents	15

We've been seeing it on the internet since long before the web was a twinkle in Berners-Lee's eye.  I can remember how productive we all got every September when a new wave of college freshmen got access to the internet for the first time and made usenet a no-go zone for a month or two.  It just doesn't come in predictable waves anymore.	15
0	&gt;different than choosing personal financial gain over US foreign policy objectives when you are Secretary of State.  What type of personal financial gain are you talking about?

1	Libertarians only require you have a voluntary agreement,  holding a person against their will and making them work is a violation of libertarianism. If however you found someone willing to work for free,  voluntarily of their own free will with no coercion, then libertarians have no problem with it.   I have done a HUGE amount of work for people 100% for free,  anything from helping a family member move,to developing software for a charity for no money.  Should all of these people have been required to pay me a wage,  should there be no concept of voluntarism?    Slavery is wrong because of the violence and force not because there is no wage.	15

0	Where did I say a thing about the intent? I am sure that was the intent (that said I did not read much about it from the art side). I think there is a difference between provocative art, intended to engender thinking, and provocative political acts, intended to engender conflict.   Now that said, I am not a particularly fond of *Piss Christ*, I think it provoked without saying anything.

1	Social conservatism needs to go the way of the dinosaurs. It has long been a drowning man pulling everyone near him down in attempt to stay afloat.  Ironically, Democrats are doing the exact opposite. Instead of focusing on civil liberties &amp; non-intervention, they have desperately clung to big-government tax and spend bureaucracy.	15

They literally only exist to protect the worst, most crooked cops out there, and they take obscene pleasure in doing it.	15
0	Well they proselytize and then we get people who kill people because they believe that they are morally correct to do so.   So their philosophy must be refuted.	15

1	Libertarianism is the only viable future for the GOP.  It's just a matter of how many elections they lose before coming to that realization.    Social conservatives cannot compete with Hollywood.  Liberals dominate the culture, just look at how quickly views gay marriage shifted.  While that's a losing bet for them, at least adopting a libertarian stance on these issues (we disagree, but we won't throw you in jail for doing X) will give them a chance to compete on the economic argument, which thanks to reality is theirs to be won.	15
0	Charles Kulp, assistant chief of Walkerton Police Department, said the department responded to threats against the businesses by increasing their presence in the town’s business district. There was no trouble last night, according to Kulp…      He added that while the O’Connor family, owners of the Memories Pizza, 608 Roosevelt Road, want to reopen, they are unlikely to do so anytime soon due to threats against the business made on social media that have them worried about their safety.      “They would like to open but they are scared to do so and I am not sure if they are going to open,” Kulp said.  http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/walkerton-police-beef-up-patrols-near-business-at-center-rfra/article_1a6ee13c-d94e-11e4-86ed-2b9e5e2740ed.html  idiot troll	15
1	No completed investigation so they can't reveal any information, but they already know that their officers did the right thing?  What's the point of the investigation if they already have their conclusion?  &gt;The town wouldn't release the police reports to the newspaper, denying a FOIL appeal, saying there is an ongoing investigation. Ramapo police declined to answer any questions, including about the audio, referring all questions to the town attorney's office.  &gt;"The actions of the town of Ramapo police were reasonable under the circumstances," said Ramapo Assistant Town Attorney Dennis Lynch, who declined to say what investigation might be underway.	15

Just provide them with food and a minimal healthcare and they are happy to live out their lives as cattle in the shade.  So of course they would vote for someone automatically who would support this (Obama) as well as support a hate speech law to 'keep their lives calm' like a literal piece of cattle would.	15

So basically you're intentionally using an outdated term that means the inverse of what it currently does in nearly 99% of all circles, i.e. double speak. It would be like me going into /r/liberal and advocating for classical liberal ideas. It's bullshit and I would expect to get called out over it.	15

0	I don't understand exactly how I need to "come back to reality".   Drugs are simply someone's own choice. If I so choose to put a drug in my body, no one should be able to stop me. No one is forced to provide for me, and if they are, that is wrong and illegal. My family members don't have any obligation to provide for me either. If I injure someone else, that is MY fault, as I have irresponsibly used said drug. In that case, I'm guilty of a crime.	15

Refusal to make a cake with specific words you find offensive isn't equivalent to refusing to serve someone because of *who they are* or *what they believe*.   For instance, if he said "I won't make you a cake, because you're Christian" that would be a violation of the CRA. Instead it was "I won't make you a cake that says that".	15

1	In all seriousness, I hope an organization starts campaigning to make women subject to selective service.

Obviously having the capacity to examine your views and change them if they're erroneous is a great quality but the issue is when politicians have whatever view is currently popular with their voting block.

The last time I checked, your average cop isn't patrolling the street with full battle rattle, artillery and tank support or a squadron of A-10's flying above. Your average street cop isn't loaded out with an m249 or frag grenades. This hyperbole does nothing but to alienate the libertarian cause.

0	Following these links it sounds to me like all these "experts" are confusing protecting speech with denying someone a right to be offended...a right which does not exist. Facebook as a case study?...really? If any of that is true then by rights we can use the First Amendment for anything we want. It's absolutely against my religion to pay income tax, and I absolutely think Facebook shoild be used as a call to execute all corrupt government officials publicly...but that gets you a visit from black Tahoes, doesn't it? Really...if hate speech were "protected" you'd be hearing a LOT more of it.	15
0	&gt;People have free will.  Possibly, but so what?   &gt;If someone chooses to kill black people, it doesn't matter that they are a member of the KKK, and the ACLU. It is the action that is illegal, not the speech. And, it is the responsibility of the actor to not break laws.   None of that is at all relevant to my point.	15

1	&gt;P.S. Why are unpaid internships legal in these cities that are clamoring for minimum wage hikes? Surely this would constitute "slave labor" in their eyes right?  Even better, why is *volunteer work* legal in these cities? If its wrong to do labor for free or cheap, why is it right if you do it for charity?  Its basically saying "you are free to give away your labor... UNLESS ITS TO A FOR-PROFIT BUSINESS in which case... NO."	15

0	I hate that saying referring to government, "protecting its (interest) with " guns". Yeah, if you refuse most things the government demands, it will come down to them using guns, so it's not wrong. but that's not the reality most of the time. They use the power to lock you in a room the rest of your life, with the hope that it won't happen.  I'm really just giving you a hard time. But seriously, to me, there's not much worse than death, but being put in prison for a reason you know doesn't justify it, that's definitely up there.	15

0	I do not disagree with you and I am aware that there is no requirement to protect anyone.  With that in mind, what exactly are they supposed to be doing? Is it merely neutral, or actually malicious?	15
0	&gt; Likely because you see the contradiction between your claims and why speech matters.  There's no such contradiction. There's just a limit to how much absurdity I'm willing to engage with, especially with trolls.   &gt; I never said that. We both don't hold that view.  You did say that, and you do hold that view.

It's incredibly troubling that she went back on her word though, especially now that she wants us to give her the benefit of the doubt on everything that looks like an impropriety.	15

0	&gt;So, when he points out to a Chinese newspaper that the NSA is illegally hacking Chinese civilians computers,   How is that illegal? Foreign surveillance is exactly what NSA is supposed to do. What's controversial is domestic surveillance. No one (except Snowden) has ever made the utterly retarded claim that it's illegal to spy on foreigners.   &gt;you consider that to be traitorous?  Yes. China hacks our computer networks all the time and steals our military technology. Again counterintelligence is exactly what the NSA is SUPPOSED to do.	15

1	These early polls are meaningless, particularly with respect to Rand.  The reason is that his positions aren't very defined to the average voter (and a number of them are conveniently changing in time for the Republican primary).  If Rand manages to win the nomination he will have adopted most of the Republican party line, and at that point you will see his numbers start to resemble that of a generic Republican.	15

Its no different then the CIA agents dressing as Doctors distributing Polo vaccines in Pakistan.  Their hijacking of the vaccination campaign has led directly to the deaths of actual doctors and a lack of available vaccines.  Hillary's shameless use of her gender to get elected will certainly make things worse for people who actually work for gender equality and who will now be painted with the same brush as scum-of-the-earth Hillary Clinton.	15

1	The utopian end state that socialists believe in might not be comprised of violence and theft, but the means they support to get there are.   You see a contradiction in how capitalism is defined because you're equivocating different uses of the word. Socialists define capitalism differently than free-marketers do, so when you point out a country that's capitalist according to one definition, it doesn't match with the other.  The same thing when someone points out that the corrupt system we live under is socialist - "Oh, that's not *real* socialism."	15
1	Campus rape is probably overblown but it certainly does take place.  Easy way to address the problem: **stop having universities handle crimes**. Crimes should not be handled in a special way just because they take place at a college.

0	You are agreeing with the Mayor's crappy, backtracking of her initial comments which she had 6 hours to correct even if it were a Freudian slip.  She did not.  Only after the riots started and she was confronted by a reporter with her initial statement did she deny she ever said it.  Her police chief , who is black, is going to bury her instead of taking the fall for ordering the stand down.  Police were standing on designated corners while rioters were burning and looting buildings right across the street from them.  Why?  Lazy cops?  You are going to have a 50% black police force bury that bitch for lying.	15

Another article I read quoted progressives as saying, "good bye and good riddance" to those small stores b/c if they can't afford to pay a living wage then they don't deserve to be in business.  That's fine until you realize these are the same people who hate Wal-Mart and other big-box stores.  So, what's it going to be?  Mom and pop stores or big "corporate" stores?

1	Not the national guard.  The Texas State Guard. Texas has a National Guard and a State Guard.  Very similar, but the State Guard is made up mostly of veterans, cops and medical professionals, and these days is largely for disaster relief. The only weapons training they officially do is pistol training, and they are not a fighting force any more, though most of the Guard knows how to fight, and owns guns.   Its sort of like a Militia, but composed of people who know what they are doing, and it answers to the Governor of Texas.	15

1	&gt; It does not apply to any social commentary, which we can take action against through boycotts, picketings, etc...whatever non-violent means we choose.  Which is exactly what isn't happening.

No one would think we need a constitutional guarantee that we can say "I love ice cream" or "what a lovely day".

A Mad Max movie should star Mad Max. Period.	16

I looked at the question that feminist offered and concluded that all the writers could came up with the same questions and then just flipped a coin or rolled some dice.   IE. Is the girl angry at the baby because it is a product of rape? head is yes, tail is no. Hey I got heads so it is a yes. Is the girl over that anger at the baby and now in the loving stage? Hey I got tails so no.	16

A lot of alumni are upset with the schools backing of her and refusing to donate. I would be very curious to see the record for donations before and after her hiring.  The same school that MLK went to is now the home of a racist bitch that spit on his legacy. It's shameful	16

0	&gt; I said that it indicates that there's no danger of women gaining supremacy, which seems pretty obvious to me, unless we mean very different things by supremacy.  Google "Bureaugamy" and get back to me on that.  &gt;there are studies that show that women are generally viewed as less competent than men when they have the same qualifications or give the same level of performance.  That's because of AA: which is a disadvantage that the average man has compared to the average woman.  Because women are getting positions based on gender rather than merit, of course the qualifications of a woman come under more question.	16

Games that have male characters behaving like that are always really fun to play and get lost in though.  Edit: It's probably why the friendship between Garrus and a male Shepard in Mass Effect is so great, they behave like two average guys even though they are different species.	16

0	2 sounds best to me, providing the woman only gets support from the state if she is living in poverty with a child. So a doctor like this woman wouldn't get anything.

As a girl who graduated in science, I can tell you every year there was 3-4 guys in my biology and chemistry classes, the rest were female. It was rediculous.	16

In almost every single aspect a false rape victim is essentially guaranteed jail time unless they somehow magically got the accuser on video/tape/social media/email etc... actually admitting to the fact that it's a false rape.   These things are not even close to being equal in terms of the legal process which is why they are so often talked about.	16

It only takes a few individuals to start something and then everybody has to take sides. Then there's gossip, talking behind others backs, silent treatment, fucking up others work, making really inappropriate remarks to intentionally hurt someone else, all that jazz.	16

0	&gt;for me loyalty is everything, if someone genuinely believed i was some kind of scumbag when i was completely innocent then they lose me in their life forever.  So for you loyalty is everything... but only people being loyal to you? OP has stayed loyal to his wife and family even when many of them turned their backs on him, and that's commendable. There's nothing wrong with trusting/hoping that people, like his wife, will eventually see the truth.   I'm not saying she wasn't wrong, but loyalty clearly isn't everything to you if they would lose you forever.	16

Sure, I could do more to keep the honeymoon stage but every time things start to calm down, they go for something more exciting while keeping you on a chain. I've only dated one person who stayed and was fine after the honeymoon stage. One person out of many. It's not just general hate for women. It's a problem.	16

You can convince people equity is just about anything you want it to be,  with the  politically most powerful making the final determination.  A meaningful definition of equity and ways of achieving it requires deeply nuanced debate and good faith. This will never happen as many of the participants in this debate have agenda's different from what they appear to be.	16

0	I thought this was going to be an article about how one of the guys had to now pay child support or something crazy. Glad it was just about some crazy lady that tried to steal a baby.	16
0	A female is treating boys as if they are stupid. This is *obvious* misandry. A female is acting like she *has* to distract young MEN with cartoon bullshit when they're clearly able to learn like normal children. Typical.  You ever ask yourselves why females are the ones teaching our kids? It's sick. They're spreading their sick hate into the minds of young MEN so that they grow up FEMINIZED.	16
1	"Where have all the smart women gone?"  "Where have all the skinny women gone?"  "Where have all the good personality women gone?"	16
1	Let's not adopt the feminist technique of turning everything into sexism. The trope of slaughtering the henchmen but letting the villain live is quite common with male villains.	16
0	Ok, but we have to at least admit, if thats how he usually appears then that IS a creepy lookin dude.	16
0	I'm so very on the fence about this. It's for such a good cause, but does the ends justify the means? They're manipulating these kids. Then again, so is Santa and the Bunny... Having never had a kid, maybe that's the only way to get them to do something?  Maybe it's my own personal bias at play. I hate being controlled.	16
0	Refute the message, not the messenger, if you are able.	16
0	Also, OKC is not representative of society.  I think typically the men on there are more likely to be those who cannot find a partner of any kind in real-world social scenes, whereas the women on there are looking to widen the pool of potential suitors.  So I could believe that the guys there really are, on average, 'below average' for the real world.	16
1	Qualified how? Merely holding office, via nepotism no less, doesn't make one qualified for the highest position in our country. The only reason she is being taken seriously is her gender plain and simple. Her record is atrocious and any male with such a legacy wouldn't even be mentioned by the media and talking heads.	16
1	This type of thing would have to arise from a long term relationship to the extent that you were doing things like claiming the mother and child as dependents on your taxes.	16
1	I think you've completely missed the point of what OP is trying to say, /u/sillymod. It's the fact that a good father is shown to be playing against type, or some sort of exception to the rule. A good father supposedly is a deviation from the norm. It's also important to note that men must prove they are, or can be, good fathers while women are considered good mothers just because they gave birth. But I guess that goes back to the women as "human beings" and me as "human doings" thing.	16
0	Hahaha. You're going with upvote counting now? Classic.   Still waiting for you to provide an example of where I did what you claim I did.   Reading is hard, I know. But congrats on outperforming me on upvotes. That's pretty sweet.	16
0	Yeah, I think it's wrong and inhumane.	16
0	Feminism is a hate movement, so that's the context you're coming from.  Unlike you when they say they want equality they actually mean it, instead of pretending to be something they are not as a vehicle for denigrating an entire birth group.  &gt; While I do take a focus on women's rights  Since women have all the privilege and the rights men do not have, this contradicts your claim to only want equality.  MRAs are more or less what you only pretend to be.	16
0	The quote is giving me a mixed message.  Anyone care to explain?	16
0	You contested it but without any basis, evidence or argument.	16
0	Women also have the privilege of being the stay at home mom and not work outside the home.  The men who have this opportunity are like unicorns...    Oh and after the kids are all in school she can divorce and then go to work and collect alimony, child support and she's virtually guaranteed custody of the children.	16
0	If you give a random group of men a project to do and give them a month to do it, they're naturally come up with a plan of action and somehow get it done.   If you give the same project to a group of women, they will form cliques and get offended by the perceived sleights and nothing will get accomplished.	16
1	I didn't know it had been offline. And aren't you the one? :)	16
1	Just further proof that no matter what you say or do, some idiot will find a way to be offended by it.  If you follow their thought process (and inuse that term loosely), its pretty amazing at the mental gymnastics they'll perform to reinforce their petty views.	16
0	Good. You don't have a leg to stand on.	16
0	Number 1 is utter garbage.  Why wouldn't you marry someone that you continually have awesome sex with?  I've never understood that mindset.  One of the major reasons I married my wife is because we're so damned sexually compatible.	16
1	for an entrepreneur and business owner, hiring only women is the ultimate financial genius move, because all your employees will produce the same work for 75% of the cost	16
0	I don't think it's generally misogynistic, in the sense of biased.	16
1	What's up with these women thinking men want pictures of their kids? There's child beauty pageants with more attractive kids out there, with lots of videos and pictures. It's like going to walmart and taking pictures of the fully dressed uggo's there rather than masturbating to free online porn involving 10/10 women.   In fact, after being forced to baby sit my friends kids, I've come to a conclusion. Nobody wants to look at your kids, and they're all more thankful if you can convince society that those kids don't exist. As in keeping them quiet and out of everyone's way (and out of their ears).	16
1	Hi, self-proclaimed feminist here! I just want to say that I think your poster campaign is a fantastic idea. I love the equality-focused nature of it. Go you! I also did want to say that, while there a lots of horrible feminists out there, there are also lots of us who would never say that only men are capable of violence and other awful things. Please know that we exist and are happy to work with you guys towards a more equal future. :)	16
0	I suggested that years ago ... I think its a useful rhetorical position in order to get reproductive rights for men.	16
0	Well then your metaphor is wrong	16
0	So what are you saying then, because you're not making any sense. You may as well be unicorns words for all the sense you're feminising.	16
0	Cool story bro, who is this "feminist MGTOW" that you speak of? Seems abnormal, I've never encountered a feminist MGTOW or even a submissive MGTOW.  Why do you bring this discussion here instead of /r/MGTOW ?  Is there an alpha/beta quiz that one can take to determine one's social class?	16
0	And I'm merely pointing out why defamation isn't really an effective countermeasure to slander like this.  This is not an easy case and damages would be difficult to prove... not to mention you'd struggle to find a sympathetic jury AND you have no idea if you'll be able to collect a judgment (if you win) from the defendant.	16
0	Technically a child's medical care falls to the parents. As a Libertarian, I'd be against taking away those rights in favor of a ban/forced compliance.  This is a very tricky subject.	16
0	What I am "exactly" trying to do is to increase understanding.   That dude in the story didn't understand how what he was doing could be seen as being wrong.	16
0	Well, I guess we need to get our shit together then, and stop pressuring young fellers to try impress women.	16
0	Women don't get paid for taking care of children or doing more housework.  Some housewives may be pampered, but overall many women make less because of the pressures they face to take on childrearing / domestic housework, and we should recognize that work as a contribution of value even if you may not think highly of it.	16
0	Screw Clinton,  I hope she gets ill and cant run, im goin with Sanders.	16
1	&gt; But just as the beauty standards for men were starting to get as stringent as they have always been for women, along comes the Dad Bod. Now all of our prospective Brad Pitts can look more like Seth Rogens.  She's disappointed that women couldn't oppress men. Women were about to finally be on top! The nerve of this... this... *equality*.	16
0	What did the dress look like?  Edit: I don't see what's wrong with the dress.	16
0	i will play the devil advocate.  specially because she mentioned she got death threats in person and online. I think she is not lying about that because she said she got only one of each unlike certain youtuber who claims get them every time she breaths.  no one deserve getting death threats and i hope those get investigated and got to justice too.	16
0	Well as far as aesthetics go, I'm going to go with cut. Even my few friends who are uncut willingly admit they wish their parents had.  I also have yet to meet a woman who prefers uncut. I had a wonderful time in Europe partly due to how much European women expressed delight at my dick. Yes, it was very flattering. They loved the absence of skin when giving me head and one made a comment about how a lot of uncut men smell awful.  I'm just being honest.	16
0	I just responded to what you said - which sounded like a soft version of what islamic clerics say.  No Im not obsessed with Islam.	16
1	I see now you did say legal rights in the title	16
0	&gt;The police didn't hear anyone screaming themselves. They only had the neighbor saying she heard someone screaming. That is not enough for them to force entry without a warrant.  How do you know what the police heard?	16
0	Oh for christs sake. Are we REALLY calling this sexist now! Lets not turn into feminists who patrol the media trying to find things to call sexist...	16
1	I see photographers in parks taking pictures of regular people all the time, I don't think it's weird. At the pool? Perhaps, but fully clothed kids should never be an issue, even if a perv is taking pictures of them.	16
0	That's not misandry or bigotry, though.  Just sexist and cuntish.	16
1	When my parents ask me about marriage and children, I show them stories like this. No way will I ever let myself get legally or financially attached to a woman (or man for that matter). As ridiculous as this case is, I'm not confident it will turn out in the man's favor. Sad.	16
0	yeah kinda. except im not playing exactly playing "devils advocate"for the sake of discussion or perspective. this place is actually filled with some really repugnant and stupid posts. so yes i only post here out of disagreement. but it's not the devil im advocating for	16
0	Whoa! That's the type of weird ass statement you get when you accidentally sign up for the crazy conservative news letter. Lol this is reddit and it hasn't even been downvoted yet despite being dumb as fuck and conservative.	16
1	Where will this stupidity end? Not even gay men are safe from it now?  Christ, homosexuality used to be the bisexual man's refuge from this stupidity.  &gt;Weep, you girls. My penis has given you up.  Now it penetrates men’s behinds. Goodbye, wondrous femininity!  - unknown Pompeii grafitti writer, first century.	16
0	I really liked her anecdote about her conversation with Germaine Greer. It really demonstrates the level of pure disdain and vilification that exists in the minds of the moist prominent and respected feminists.	16
1	Probation means shes cant leave a certain area or state.   Prison means shes cant do this to someone else.	16
1	check the comments, people are calling them out   Honestly I'd let feminists continue this narrative, its a huge mistake on their part cause it shatters the idea that feminism is for equality.	16
0	Im not taking the feminist side, Im just explaining difference.  They are advancing the pov that a drunk woman is like a minor or a mentally handicaped person who cannot legally enter into a contract,  and therefore had a crime commit against them - consent is a legal term pertaining to contract.  dui is a whole other story, where someones being drunk is a crime and there is no contract.	16
0	This is nothing to do with gender over gender. This is a couple who were cleared unsuited from the start, and the long split amplifies this.   That doesn't mean it's OK for her to be unfaithful. It's clearly not. However, her sex as a woman does not an offence to men make.	16
1	*I have already talked to lawyers and everyone told me I would be wasting my time as a unwed father to fight for custody.*  When she's already lost custody of an older child to another man? I doubt you'd be wasting your time. I think you need to find yourself a bulldog of a lawyer and take a swing at this. Weekends really aren't enough. Your daughter needs you to fight for 50/50.	16
0	It's like arguing that we don't need English because we have Esperanto. Nobody used reverse question mark, not because they don't have it, most keyboards don't have ™ either, and people still use soon™. It's just a retarded fad and most people just conform.  Sarcasm is NOT a grammar construct, it's semantics. A certain intelligence needed for it. Imagine if someone behaved like an [Elcor](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Elcor) and prefaced everything with "With sarcasm: your points are very good and make total sense".	16
0	Please point out one 'male privilege' which did not carry a corresponding social obligation? Shit, point out one that isn't better explained by gynocentrism and male disposability than 'da patriarchy!'	16
0	But I don't like English...	16
0	I just checked it again to be sure. Still a great joke from a great comedian.	16
1	After being hospitalized twice, and having nurses wipe my comatose ass, I can say that I have more respect for nurses than damn near any profession. I'd imagine anyone who has been hospitalized for an extended period of time feels the same.	16
0	LOL yea that's about right.  A false comparison based on a false analogy.  The NAZI where NOT socialist.  They where totalitarian.  Jewish Communities WHERE socialist prior to WWII.  This conversation is much like me walking into a holocaust memorial, talking about how great traditional Jewish communities where before being destroyed by the NAZI and being shouted down for being a NAZI.	16
0	I disagree. TRP and MRM both have similar premises. Men are currently disadvantaged in a lot of ways in today's social paradigm. However, from there TRP and MRM go about dealing with it in completely different ways. TRP advocates exploiting the system for as much as it is worth while MRM advocates complaining on reddit.	16
1	I have and it's a bitch to work with them. Really depends on the job type as far as how many you'll encounter. Lazy fisherman tend to get fired while lazy office workers find it a lot easier to deflect work/blame.	16
0	Disagree with title. All have self will. As for indicating comparative amount, fatties can exhibit more will in areas besides eating discipline so their exhibited will in one region makes no guarantees about their sum will as a being. Same with other unhealthy habits like smoking or cutting. Karen for example. Just cause I don't smoke doesn't mean I have more will than she does. Same consideration to fatties.	16
0	Alright, settle down.	16
0	The real world is a war of attrition, not a war of honor.	16
0	I want to be able to shut them down in an argument with articles like this. I already know the world favors women and they have more rights than I do.	16
1	I personally think that it is same, in this context. But one could argue that human rights are not absolute.	16
1	Rape or pedophilia -  teacher suggestively smiling at a teen or leaning over his desk?	16
1	Yeah. 'The police said if he is a sex offender he will be charged.' translating to 'Jesus lady the only conceivable way this is a crime is if he's violating parole pertaining to this sort of thing.'	16

0	well, the sunshine part is a bit over the top. If I were a woman, I'd just smile and nod, but   1. women are different, and  2. As a guy over 50, I usually pass out if a woman even so much as glances at me.	16
1	Did someone mention sloths?  Here's a random fact!  A sloth's laziness is actually a great method of survival. The slow movement and camouflage helps it evade detection from natural predators.	16
1	Lilith went there and pretty much runs the place now, remember?	16
1	IF those "studies" and "research" are actually done properly, rather than being the same old wage gap-esque handwaving, with proper controls and data points, then it's not sexist to point out the results of them.    Big "if", of course.	16
0	Please differentiate between the Israeli government and Israelis themselves. There is a small but growing men's rights community there that has received good news coverage.	16

1	Remember when hawkeye got shot and had part of his body regenerated by a female doctor?	16
1	While the position he was in was no doubt unfair to her choices in the matter, **this wouldn't be a fucking problem if full paternal surrender was on the table**.  The guy isn't fucking dumb. Her "going it alone" becomes her "going it with his subsidization" if she falls on hard times and the state traces paternity to him. Why do you think he's so focused on her being partnered up?	16
0	Zero is least possible which would mean not punishing any crimes at all.	16
0	She's saying that people didn't transport slaves prior to white Europeans doing it.  The only way to do that would be to steal their land as well.  So the problem wasn't slavery, but that white Europeans didn't take over Africa as well?  People are saying that she's right.  I can't see how slavery would be justified in any situation, but maybe that's just me.	16
1	&gt; I dated a woman... [with] little kids...  That was your first mistake.	16
0	Sweet Christ. *Get the picture.*  They will call us sexist no matter what, but if they can prove that we associate with redpillers, then that claim will look legitimate in the eyes of everyone else.  Political movements and similar things are "hearts and minds" campaigns. We can't convince feminists how brainwashed they are, but we can show millions of non-feminists that men need and deserve their help in order to secure their freedom.	16
0	I don't know if I've ever seen urinals with dividers. In fact I've been to two that had a fucking MIRROR at chest height along the wall, such that it was damn near impossible not to catch a glimpse of the other lads in its reflection if you were to look straight ahead. Maximum awkward.	16
0	that wasn't the argument. see previous comments	16
1	That woman should be punished.	16
1	Typical feminist line: if men can make any decision about reproduction, children or sex that does not slavishly cater to the woman's desires, then they are using it as a weapon. No pretense about equality at all.	16
0	Statistics show males are a problem population. If you use that sort of logic feminists win and men get demonized so don't. We have way too many people here who couldn't win a debate with feminists to save their lives. They spent generations trying to define men as a problem population and you hand it to them on a platter to degrade another race of men.  That's pretty dumb especially when you're trying to not look like a racist.	16
0	honestly this is probably the most shitty talking point that's ever been on /r/menrights.  Both sexes get payed way too much.	16
0	You can change, TRP can help you.	16
0	I posted the legal, dictionary, and medical definitions for the word so you have not read shit. Fuck you, you pedo-enabler. Don't insult me because you are too lazy and self absorbed to read. Do your fucking work.	16
1	You know what *tickles the shit* out of me about this?  Just days earlier Joss was tweeting about how "disappointed" he was in Jeremy Renner and Chris Evans for their "sexist" joke about Black Widow. Now he's getting the same bullshit feminist treatment.   It's almost enough to make a guy believe in karma.   Like someone else said: Wil Wheaton next please? Please, universe?	16

1	Cause you're a selfish bitch with poor planning who married a soldier? I'm gonna go with cause you're a selfish bitch with poor planning who married a soldier.  After reading article: Holy shit, I'm 100% correct. "I’m going to leave my husband for him one day and we’re going to move away from this place where everyone knows me as so and so’s wife and we’ll just be another normal, boring couple." That is a direct quote, she's going to leave him 'one day'. Bitch, you leave right the fuck now you horrible piece of shit.	16
0	&gt; "if women ruled the world there would be no wars."   In a sense it's true, given that they'd be too busy bitching at each other to be disciplined enough to form armies and keep them organized.	16
1	Stop being sorry and slam a door in my face, goddamnit!!  Just kidding, love you Canadians. I wish I could be you.	16
0	That seems ridiculous. At best we should grant the insanity defense, which would mean treatment in a lockdown facility until she was able to stand trial, at which point she'd probably be let out on time served, depending on how long her treatment was.	16
1	The protective mommy who spews something like "You're a piece of shit."  Then when the man defends himself verbally she'll say "Umm excuse me there are children here."	16
1	"new" feminist campaign?  Isn't that pretty much the definition of feminism?	16
0	Sounds like a nice way to have a bunch of children living in poverty.	16
0	Is this really a big deal?  People are free to have preferences.  You may personally find it offensive, but if you don't like it, don't follow them on social media or listen to their station.  I am only 5'8" and if anyone doesn't find me attractive because of this, it doesn't bother me because some do, including my wife.  I have preferences too.  I don't think I would have ever dated a black woman or a woman who was fat.  Why should anyone date anyone they are not attracted to?	16
1	It is also counter-evidence for the common feminist mythology that eveything would be puppies and rainbows without men.	16
1	Good, bitch should think twice before she publicly shames an innocent person.	16
1	This is the kind of logic failure that is slowly dragging the feminists down.	16
1	This though process used to make sense. But current freedoms and cherry picking at ideals makes it seem ludicrous.	16
0	Feminism being the radical idea that women are people, Men's Rights is the radical idea that women are adults capable of making their own decisions and handling the consequences.	16

1	&gt; I'd rather you advocate for equal rights of all genders and call yourselves Egalitarians or Equalists  I'm just here because /r/egalitarianism is comparatively dead. :)	16
0	So what you're saying is that there's positive and negative racism, and you determine whether it's positive or negative based on race. Disgusting.   If people like you were honest and didn't try to call it "reverse" racism, everyone would know immediately that you're an ignorant bigot and not waste their time arguing about it.   Your analogy doesn't work either, you just sound stupid comparing racism to haircuts.   Edit: downvotes but no rebuttal. Sorry you're simply just ignorant racists.	16
0	They are two different concepts, but community property, when applied in cases like this, effectively *is* alimony.	16
0	&gt;there is no evidence according to the police. case closed. she lied.  I whistled the theme to ghostbusters yesterday while down on the beach there is no evidence of that either so i must be lying too.  you sir are a grade A fucking moron.	16
0	I thought men made every decision with their penis and it was a given?	16
1	Yep, there is a "Woman's  Resource Center" at my school, but there is none for males .	16
1	I'm awaiting word on whether the feminist lynch mob got him.	16
1	Yea, but your chances of getting them charged with anything in addition to not being found guilty of whatever charges they want to slap on you goes way down without visible proof. If you let them in before they lie and drag you down to court for anything they see fit, including fighting back despite them finding nothing, its your word against two officers of the law.	16
1	Instead of 'Men get raped too' it should say "Women can rape too!" THAT is the missing set of rapes in the total set of rapes, the ones that women commit. I don't think anyone really doubts that men get raped, the real doubter part I think is that sometimes the rapist is a women.	16
1	I went to a show and few ladies used the men's room. I didn't mind but don't you freak out if I use yours	16
0	The Left has dominated university and college academia for decades, but now with Obama as president, they feel free to openly drop the mask now and reveal their true contempt for white people. "Our time has come", seems to be their slogan.	16
1	Can confirm, I studied engineering. None of us female STEM majors gave a shit. But all the liberal arts/psychology majors across campus bitched and moaned daily about how we needed more empowered women in STEM.	16
1	Roll over risk. It's not a big risk, but it is a risk. And naturally, it's magnified if there's any alcohol involved.	16
1	If it were me, I'd made the complaint first, then tell the professor about it.	16
1	But you chose to have oral and not vaginal for this express reason.   I can't fuck this crazy bitch; too risky. But she wants to suck my dick? Welllllll......OK.	16
1	I've gone to the local schools to support their bake sales and musicals/plays... Am I on some sort of list, too? Just for supporting my community? I'm starting to feel sick to my stomach...	16
1	Exactly. What a wonderful "1984" way of describing it though!  It's a "problem" with the evidence, because there was none. And it must be a problem, because the "victim" must be believed, so the accused must be guilty, so if there is no evidence, that must be a "problem".	16
0	Um. Yeah, no.	16
0	If *anybody* was walking around my childs school on a non public event day without being part of staff, i'd want to know about it.  Discrimination against men does happen, of course it does, but I think this is a pretty poor example, at least without knowing the exact context. /u/ThogOfWar says he's visited local schools for bake sales etc, but for a notice to be put up about one person in particular i'd wager that this wasn't the case herer and they had good reason to suspect something illigetimate was going on.	16
1	Really?  Wow.  Considering all the high-profile false accusations that have been coming out in the news lately, you'd think they'd ease up on the whole "Women don't lie about rape" thing, because yeah, apparently they do.	16
1	"Well, you look nice today."    "Fuck off, pug."  Edit: I'm leaving it.	16
0	&gt; im not talking about doxing her if someone takes a photo of her in public, as he did that man and posts it to the masses to shame her for her behaviour  thats doxxing.  &gt; she is merely suffering from the front end of exactly what she was doing to someone else.  it still doesn't excuse the behavior and shouldn't be accepted, much less excused.	16
1	Amazon is one of the few remaining retailers that insists on selling the "Boys are stupid, throw rocks at them" books	16
1	When science and gender studies collide, it seems that Gender studies win sadly.   It was called out for being crap, and instead of following the process, and improving their work.. they went to the media, cried "FEELINGS!", got someone fired and caused scientific peer review to die a little more, and give ground to Gender Studies.   /sigh	16
0	Arguing about why dui is illegal has nothing to do with the debate about sex while legally incapacitated.  The context is legally incapacitated to enter into an agreement, like a mentally retarded person signing a contract or agreeing to sex.  Not comitting a crime of being drunk in charge of a vehicle.	16
0	And there is a big difference between a victim and an accuser.	16
0	Sub par right wing propaganda of idiots. Are roads charity? Do you wish to buy police or fire protection individually? You can push a principal like rejecting welfare but the general welfare is pretty expansive. Modern nations must provide for it or they will fall far behind their competitors. Free public school for example. Up your game and remember this is MEN'S RIGHTS not LIBERALS SUCK.	16
1	Me too.  Putin it in yo mamma!	16
0	lol as if the burden of proof is on me, I wouldn't waste my time nor effort giving you "data" that the moon isn't hollow, simply by virtue of you being retarded enough to believe it is, is enough for you to be completely dismissed as having no value.  the fact you are so dense you genuinely believing taking someones picture in public and uploading to social media is a criminal offence is absolutely fucking embarrassing (for you), the fact you are too dense to even recognise this, is even more embarrassing.	16
1	meninism should only fight over misleading and trivial issues:  * Like only 1% of the highest paid fashion models are men. * Less than 2% of the cosmetics are sold to men. * Men don't have their own word for themselves (like wo-man). Man includes women, while women excludes men.	16
0	I can respect that he is calling the woman out for being batshit crazy and giving vegans a bad name but he also went on to say that she has a good point aside from men mutilating themselves.  Vegans have this odd sort of hypocrisy to them. They care about the planet and believe humans are destroying it yet will chow down and eat the entire planet themselves. Does not compute.  In either case my point still stands, If Vegans and SJWs would practice what they preach (Like they bash Christians for dictating what should go on in the bedroom) we wouldn't have to worry about Legionality's poor little feelings getting hurt.	16

0	&gt; Definitely no grey areas anywhere.  Sure there are. This isn't one.  &gt; I met this feminist who said male rape victims don't matter and that they should be thankful for the privilege.  See, the thing is you can go on any reddit thread about male victims of rape and read countless stories [like](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2c9sfa/serious_what_is_it_like_to_be_raped_by_a_woman/cjdc8dv) [these](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2c9sfa/serious_what_is_it_like_to_be_raped_by_a_woman/cjddu1x).   You, on the other hand, can't point to a single instance of a feminist saying anything remotely like male rape victims should feel 'privileged' for having been raped, and that they, "don't matter."	16

0	Well, that was just *stupid* of him. He literally just drove a container filled with his sperm to this couple's house, apparently signed some non-legally-binding document that the couple had drafted *themselves*, and figured any of that was proper procedure. That's not how sperm donation works. You don't just respond to a personals ad asking for a sperm donor, send them a turkey baster filled with your semen and congratulate them on their future baby. In the eyes of the law, this guy is the legal father of that child. Had this been done through a proper donation clinic, he would not be.	16
1	She went out of her way to start a company that exclusively hired women, and she didn't even pause for a moment to consider how sexist that might be. The company has long since gone bankrupt, but we can at least allow ourselves a bit of schadenfreude here.	16
1	I enjoyed Legend of Korra when it came out, even though Korra herself was an annoying protagonist, but so much of the media with a female lead just become preachy. Korra was good because it was just about the character and her friends, not about feminist or female empowerment being shoved down anyone's throats. Many of these movies are, "If men can do it so can we, or even better than men!" Rather than just having it be a movie with characters acting like characters, and not like reincarnated messiahs that have to tear down the walls of discrimination.	16
0	No need to be derisive, we are just having a conversation.  My point is that a field of study, does not become another field of study, just because it is being used as a tool within a different field of study. In other words, Stats does not become Gender Studies, or any other field of study it is used in. That is why I used the History example. Your argument would mean that History turns into Gender Studies, just because you review History when studying Gender Studies.   P.S. Thanks for the heads up, I'll start working on my social skills over the internet.	16

Edit: wow, redpill losers brigading a thread where they got called on their pathetic sexist masquerade,  how surprising	16

0	Meanwhile she's being targeted because she's a black women and we have thousands of instances of white men and women saying the same stuff over many years. It's not racist until black people do it? How convenient.	16
1	I GUARANTEE you, there have been men who have scored better than her academically, failed the physical test, and were not able to become a firefighter. This is pure pussy pass. If the wage gap did exist, which it doesn't, it would be supported by the situation that happened here. Men do the required work, men get paid $1. Female does some of the work, female gets paid 75 cents.	16

1	Some people don't like beards, I can't go more than a week without shaving, it's too irritating.  I don't like a hairy crotch on a woman for many of the same reasons she doesn't like beards. I'm allowed to say that, women can judge me how they please. Some agree, some don't, life goes on.	16

0	It's not much of a lottery when not a single person has been drafted since 1973.  Women have faced a far more significant "lottery with their lives" on issues surrounding abortion, including incessant political attempts to prevent them having access to same.  At least some of those pregnant women denied access to legal abortion through various political strategies since 1973 died as a result.  So do you think that only women should be allowed to vote on abortion?	16
0	We don't know the circumstances, and admittedly the letter is poorly written in that it doesn't describe the circumstances. It just says he appeared twice on campus. That could mean he was innocently attending a public event as some have suggested here, or it could mean he was roaming the halls or playground without authorization on a school day which certainly would not be 'doing nothing wrong'.  Jumping to conclusions that he is doing nothing wrong seems just as unwarranted as jumping to conclusion that he is doing something wrong. How about we get facts. Crazy, I know, this being Reddit and all.	16
1	I work 8-10 hours a day while my girl sits at home. So, because she does my laundry and cooks my meals, I've just replaced my mother with her? How utterly ridiculous.	16
1	Taking away a boy's healthy body part for reasons ranging from highly dubious to outright malicious while any similar procedures are (rightfully) strictly forbidden on girls, no matter the degree. Said procedure leaves men less sensitive, can cause severe complications and even death. Many circumsized men are depressed about it and feel robbed.  Oh gee, I wonder how that's possibly a men's rights issue.	16
1	Slightly misleading title?  This applies to marrying a single parent who is considered custodial parent.  This applies to parents of all genders.  I don't see this as a Men's Rights issue.	16
0	&gt;Going to x - 500 calories a day generally requires a lifestyle change and the constant hunger, fatigue, and discipline required that may result can be too much for many people.   Yeah, no. Try eating three pounds of chicken breast and claim you're hungry and tired.	16
1	This is what you get when we continually give our own responsibilities to the state. Get used to it. No wants to have to take care of things themselves so the boot is the replacement.	16
0	this is sexist in multiple ways as it can be viewed that mens sexual exploits are not related to character, such that if they fuck up and act like a whore its "No harm done" because they are not defined in worth by the value of their sexual loyalty.  you can interpret this poster many ways	16
1	There was a study recently that showed "women forcibly penetrated" and "men forced to penetrate" at almost the exact same rate. Rape is not just a women's issues as a lot of people like to make it out to be.	16

1	it's funny that racism is defined by some as power and privilege when it seems pretty clear that racism and sexism only being a one way street is in of itself power and privilege for women and people of colour... therefor nullifying itself by contradiction.	16

1	&gt;your life will be better with or without a silly contract  I agree, but people change and situations change. The marriage contract just makes a break all the more difficult and painful, and it is completely unnecessary in nurturing a prosperous and loving relationship.   If anything, it's like trying to enjoy a meal while handcuffed to the dinner table. If I like the food, then why do I need the handcuffs to keep me at the table?  Pretty soon it will be the only thing that I'm thinking about, which will completely ruin the meal.	16

1	Also, a lot of people who don't know about the MRM think we're woman-haters. I'm female and don't see how this happened.	16
1	I understand where you coming from, but doesn't mean I should support or condone it.  Kindness doesn't equal weakness. If a woman has her head so far up her ass she can't figure this out, then she deserves the jerk she will end up with.   I admit I won't tell a girl I am a nice guy anymore after reading how feminist bitch about it. I will let my actions speak for themselves.  Ever since finding this reddit, I have dumped a hot girl, according to my standards, because she didn't understand that I wasn't a door mat.	16
0	Isn't there anybody in this sub who is circumcised and is happy about it?  I am all for equality and men's rights and have been subbed here for a long time, but this is always one issue I disagree with. I love that I'm circumcised and so happy that my parents made that choice for me.  Edit: I have said nothing vitriolic or antagonistic here, why the downvoting? Please stop downvoting stuff that you don't agree with.	16
1	Learn: objectifying is NOT bad. It's normal. What we should reach is that everyone knows this. Not bad when it's done to women either.	16
1	A fair point, but the tagline is designed to raise consciousness by turning a popular girl-power phrase on its head, not be 100% accurate. The poster specifically addresses the widespread belief that domestic violence is something that men do to women.	16

0	I believe for a large portion of history, men were given certain advantages over women when it came to politics, social power, individual rights, and control over finances. While these issues have been mostly resolved, I still believe that the attitudes that enforced these roles still are out there. I call these gender roles, and they are the same ones that prevented women from voting as the ones that give women preference in divorce courts. My goal, as a self described feminist, is to break down these gender roles (yes, even the ones that are beneficial to women), and question why they are there.	16
1	DO I TAKE CHILDREN IN TO ACCOUNT!?!!? THIS WAS NOT IN THE INSTRUCTIONS	16

0	*rolls her eyes* The FAFSA takes into account the household income in factoring in eligibility for aid. When you marry a person with a kid, you become another parent to that child with the responsibilities of being a parent. You also are contributing your income to a family income for a family unit that includes that child. Objecting to this is stupid. You think that they should factor out a parent's income because they want to have it taken out? Stupidity. That would lead to even more abuse of the system.	16
0	While I respect it, I don't understand how so many MRAs can be so left wing. Left wing politics is what caused the mess and the inequality that we face today. Conservative politics is usually clear and universal: Work hard and you'll see the benefits.	16
0	Obviously, her IQ is the equivalent of her breast size.	16
0	No, the problem with your version is that is immediately and obviously false. You could argue one way or the other about white masc. in college, but there isn't an overwhelming black masc. culture in colleges. If you wanna talk about black masc. being a huge problem in black communities, I think lot of people would be open to hearing about that.	16

1	That's it in a nutshell. Fucking lunacy.	16
1	Why can't they just send out a generic reminder to be safe without painting some random guy as a pedophile?   I mean their advice is common sense. If parents need some "pedophile on the loose" to not be idiots, maybe they should have their kids removed yesterday.	16
0	I think that all we have is his side of the story. We don't know the facts. His behavior is definitely a bit questionable. She didn't make known what she really wanted either.  I think jumping to conclusions is premature.	16

1	I like how the author mentions Bernie Sanders but then wont vote for him because hes a man despite the fact that Sanders is probably the best democrat candidate to ever have decided to run for President.	16
1	The Streisand effect is irrelevant here. He would not be suing for the picture not to be circulated, he would be suing to clear his name and seek punitive damages from the guilty parties.  Actually, you would want this lawsuit very public both to radically demonstrate his own innocence, shame the offenders and make other people think twice before doing stupid shit like this.	16
1	When the only 'crime' is that someone is a man, then yeah, it's pretty much a given that it's an SJW. It really don't take no rocket surgeon to figure that one out.	16

0	I don't understand why anyone would be bitter about hypergamy.   Oh wait, yes I do - its the people who won't look in a mirror and fix what's wrong with what they see. Its not hard to get fit, to get a good haircut and to dress in a manner that might help get you laid. . .  But of course that would require acknowledging that your current lifestyle is the cause of you not getting laid, instead its much easier to just blame women for being dumb sluts who only like douche-bros. As opposed to being normal people who are attracted to people who take care of themselves exude confidence.	16

0	And this is something about men's rights because...?	16
1	After I posted this, she said that she meant "limiting" human rights, not violating them.	16
1	It's always been this way.  This is nothing new.  Kennedy beat Nixon based on his looks.    people vote for politicians for a variety of reasons.  I understand why women would want to vote based on gender, for the same reason as I understand why minorities voted for Obama.  They are looking to be represented and I suppose part of that is to prove a point.	16
1	Even women's sex organs are hidden. Natural born liars.	16
0	Ok, if your experiences with sex involve a woman ignoring you all throughout the lead-up, fiddling with her phone in an area without service and leaving the second you are out of eyesight, I have some bad news...  &gt; Good to know that you view adult women and young boys as being equally competent to make decisions for themselves.  No, a better example would be a man I know personally who was too afraid to say 'no', and who's female abuser probably doesn't know she raped him.  Glad that MRAs will support him on that front.	16
1	This is so true.  Therefore, women will marry a guy who's a good provider but still pine for (and possibly cheat with) the alpha male who made them melt.	16
1	No, you don't need a balance of people. You need the people who can get the job done correctly and efficiently, while remaining relatively harmonious with the rest of the company.  That may or may not involve some, none, or a lot of variety in race, gender, height, or shoe size.	16
1	You shouldn't  trust anything gender related that feminists might be interested in anywhere without checking. This goes for Wikipedia and official government papers, the UN and the European parliament. Anything. And when you check, you'll find a bias certainly and propaganda (lies) almost certainly.	16
0	So you take the articles that support what you agree with on blind faith and the articles you don't as propaganda? Or are you just using buzz phrases you read on Reddit? Either way, I done. If that's the way you are, clearly MRAs are gods to you, so stay on your knees and keep praying while humming so loud you hear nothing else. Ignore that bad taste in your mouth.	16
1	"MEMEMEMEME its all about ME!  wait, there are other people involved.  HOW DARE YOU YOU RAPEY RAPIST!  MEMEMEMEMEMEME its ALL about ME!"  Feminism is narcissism given a campaign fund.	16
1	Some people need to create false divisions in order to help them justify their emotions.	16

1	I'm not ready.	16
1	You mean so that the next time she does something wrong they still won't throw her in jail. Lets be honest probation is a joke.	16

0	The average age people have their first child is 25.  When that child is 18 they will be 43.  By the time the kid is done with college (and the 22k has been saved) the parents will be 47.  In 40 years, after the money grows to 1 million, they will be 87.  Retiring at 87 is not retiring "ten years early."  Even if you had the kid right when you finished puberty, then that kid was a genius and went to college at age 10, you would still be 67 before you could retire a millionaire under your plan.	16

0	&gt; not to mention TRP is genuinely toxic.  I just read a post on TRP with a main topic of telling everyone to build something. Pick up a constructive hobby and become as close to an expert as possible, and the comments were all encouraging with ideas on how to do this; including the top comment strongly suggesting 3D printing being the future.  Yeah. So toxic.	16

1	I don't think thunderf00t was being 100% serious when he called him a hypocrite. My take on it was more that it is literally impossible to design female characters that will be acceptable to SJWs like Sarkeesian.	16
0	Many would hate having bigger boobs. There's a reason so many get surgery for them.	16
0	I wonder if we could look at it as a production curve. Like, at 8am, I don't get anything done at work (hour to show up to actual DV call??). I get the morning paper, go to the shitter, and take my morning constitutional. Then I grab my coffee and by 10 or so, I'm ready to knock out some work until lunch (proactive policing scenario??). Then finish up everything by 2pm or so and coast in til 5 (a couple of jay walking tickets??).   Maybe cops are like...humans...at work...?	16
1	Why shouldn't she laugh?  The legal system in the UK and USA are jokes.	16
1	This is yet another example of how accusations by Feminists are simply projections of themselves onto others.  Why? Just like your posting history, YOU have nothing to do with men's rights. Unless you count your previous posts in "againstmensrights."  Go back to your feminist spaces and join them in bitching about how those evil menz won't let the world revolve all around you.	16
1	Abuse how? Like, women abusing men and covering it up?	16
1	I was mentally promoted. My boss said I did an excellent job and went above and beyond. Didn't actually get paid more, but I've got a mental raise going for me. That's just like the real thing, right guise?   I'm sure feminists just need more mental "raises" to put them on equal footing as men. Tell them they did a good job. Don't leave out how you couldn't have done it without them. EQUALITY sure is sweet.	16
0	Of course you can be gay and be Catholic. The Church, in fact, says that anyone can be Catholic (and it wants everyone to be, of course).   The only catch is that to be a good Catholic you have to do your best to lead a holy life. Sex outside of marriage is the opposite of that. There's nothing special about homosexuality, frankly. The desires themselves aren't sinful (the Church says as much) because you don't have control over them. How you act on your desires, though, is where morality comes into play.	16
1	What bugs me about that is that I'm pretty sure that if I found out my mother had done that, it would outweigh any kind of feelings she might have instilled in me about hating my dad.   "I'm sorry, you kept his semen in your mouth and then later used it to *impregnate yourself?* What the fuck, mom!?"	16
1	She was the one that organized the feminist events too. She would give us extra credit on our tests if we raised our hands and asked the speaker questions. I wanted to explain how fucking wrong they were, but i didnt wanna fuck my grade.	16

0	No, that makes no sense.  The analogy you are looking for is someone deemed legally incapacitated to enter into a contract.  A minor who has agreed to sex with an adult.   A mentally retarded person who has agreed to a business contract.   A dui isn't a working analogy - they are the criminal, their crime is being legally incapacitated to drive.	16

1	Didn't Hilary pay her female workers less?  This woman has no idea what Hilary's voting history is, her stance on issues, she knows nothing other than "she's a woman." Basically, she is saying that she would vote for Palin if given the opportunity because the sex of the candidate is all that seems to matter.	16

1	Well good luck with AVFM. It's not exactly free speech zone over there anymore, either.   What with mods [not understanding sarcasm even when it's denoted with /sarc](http://s22.postimg.org/9yq4ozbbl/Grumpy_Old_Man_does_not_understand_sarcasm.jpg) and other mods [banning for 'holding the work of AVFM in contempt'](http://s2.postimg.org/re8rso5cp/contempt_of_cou_I_mean_work.jpg), or as I would call it - criticism.   Good luck indeed.	16
0	Agreed. But I think that it's not unfair for women to be at least encouraged, as that help other women then step forwards.  Strangely, I think it's possible that women may go through a stage of wanting to be MPs, bosses of companies, scientists etc., but then over time, the gloss will wear-off, and they might start to step back from these roles. Let's see.	16
0	"a business with all women doesn't work nearly as well as a business of all men, because women are catty and can't control their emotions"  Yeah, that's not an argument for female inferiority...	16
0	That implies girls are not going to see a movies because its mostly guys and are not going to buy male action figures. Its like saying Tomb Raider will flop because a woman does not appeal to a male audience.   Marvel is for boys, there is only so much they will get from the girls and not pandering will change that.   "almost half of the 24 million people who identify as comic fans on Facebook are female"   Okay find me a girl who has 10 Marvel comicbooks at home. Just one.	16

0	&gt; "A child still exists and needs support."  This is actually a hard one to respond to. Should the child suffer for the actions of the mother?	16
0	It's funny how you auto down vote as if it makes you more right. You're just some fanboy of some shit comedian hack who's greatest work is a show everyone says "used to be better"	16
0	Kinda like that but if the men/ women one was built first and then women were excluded so then they built the women only one yeah	16
1	Sure, from time to time I see misogynistic or at least poorly worded stuff here. But there's also a lot of positivity around talking about different issues that effect men that is just hard to find IRL. Men's rights isn't about misogyny. Just because there can be rare instances of such doesn't mean it's a hotbed of misogyny like he seems to think, nor does it erase the good aspects of it. And what of the blatant anti-male corners of reddit? How come they get a pass?	16
1	We should print stickers like that and place them around blatant examples of other discrimination. Like that pic floating around earlier of a female bathroom and a unisex bathroom (no males), print a sticker that says something like "whites only" to place over the female bathroom placard. Maybe they'll get the point then, but I doubt it. Feminists throw their own sons under the bus.	16
1	Remember everyone, no woman *owes* any man sex whenever *he* wants it, but withholding sex from your girlfriend/wife when *she* wants it is an act of sexual violence towards her.	16
1	Are you serious? I just told you that a moment ago.	16
1	Women don't generally decide to marry based on love. They will abandon true love in favor of access to resources most times, then when those resources are guaranteed and locked in legally with marriage and children, then they may go back to love (or lust). Usually the bad boys.	16
0	That twitter troll deserved to be punished for that, but that is a little severe for what he was doing.	16
1	I agree. Legal rights would be codified in the law. Some of these are privileges because they are based on decisions that fallible/biased judges make.	16
1	I did, and I intend on paying for all 3 of our kids higher education, but not because a law tells me to. The fact that any of them are somehow entitled to it *because* of a separation is a fucking joke. Any annuity/child support should be used for that purpose. This is double/triple dipping and is absurd.	16

1	I believe what it's trying to say is that:  "women are just as capable as men!*"  "gosh, this hammer is heavy. i'll get this man to smash the patriarchy for me"  Or in other words, feminists complain that *the patriarchy* is oppressing them, but #HeForShe is a campaign explicitly designed to recruit men (aka, the patriarchy) to smash the patriarchy.	16
1	What would happen if we called them up and asked why Sophia Sleigh didn't want to describe this monster as a rapist, but put up flashy photos of the rapist instead. ...In a polite yet firm manor, of course. Remembering that we are the respectful and reasonable ones here.	16
0	&gt; However, because people like you are so keen on denying women agency and insisting that men take care of them as though they were children  wtf where did you get that from	16
0	The gender norms elasticity that feminism tries to promote, I find really cool.  It's their problems with anyone "adhering" to gender norms that really bugs me. Everything from their attacks on Lego's "Friends line" (which tripled their female customer base, resulting in *total* consumer growth for them) to horrifyingly sexist terms like, "toxic masculinity", I could do without.	16
1	Stay at home moms have become the downfall of the US with the invention of Facebook. They sit around circlejerking each other about how wicked and evil men are, and stalk men and make up stories about them, because it gets them the likes they crave. They always receive full support.  SJW is a social network equivalent of Munchausen's.	16

I still hate this kind of shit (better clothes, better grades, better athletecism, better cars, better houses—who the fuck cares?).   Why does everything have to be a damn competition to succeed?	16
1	Those fields don't pay as well. Folks want women better represented in higher paying areas.  There is an unwritten perception that women are being held back from these fields. Men could jump into any of those women centric fields if they wanted they just don't (as much).  Of course no one allows for the possibility that women just many not like stem all that much.	16
1	My personal experience is that they're not sure what they want. Someone who's stable is boring. Someone who's exciting isn't stable enough.  Someone in touch with their emotions aren't "manly" enough. Someone who is "macho" won't share their feelings. They want a good father at home, but the exciting affair on the side, then don't understand why a man wouldn't respect her lack of loyalty. They want it all, then get pissed off at the men because they can't be polar opposites of themselves.	16
0	And you circled right back to where things were, women being excluded from better paying jobs because they can't do them.	16
1	So is the road outside my house	16
1	&gt; fair treatment is making sure that you only get asked on your specialist topics in front of your preferred audience?  No, that's the problem becasue it's exactly what happened to the Labour candidate isn't it?	16
0	Anything culturally Marxist. Anything that posits the role of women as being anything other than her biologically-ordained job: rearing children, tending to the hearth, etc. All of this has been more or less proven by evopsych. Feminism has just worked to pervert the natural order of things.  If you really are interested, the two big "founders" of modern MRA, Paul Elam and Stefan Molyneux, can explain it better than I can. Give them a look.	16
0	And the earth is flat according to Wikipedia.	16
0	And? These things don't need to be brought up every time switching the sexes in an ad would make it easily visible that something is wrong. Genderswapping things all the time just develops victim complexes that are not needed in the MRM. Seriously, that's what radfems do to develop ~~their victims'~~ women's victim complexes. I understand the incident with Matt Taylor's shirt was a ridiculous, but it has very little relevance here.	16
0	Population of Finland: 5,4 million.  If estimated female combatant casualties number for example 100 000, it is effectively the potential loss of 250 000 people in the next generation, given that they would all bear children instead of dying as combatants.  The question is how many women could Finland afford to lose to rebound to it's pre-war numbers.  Would imposing mandatory pregnancies be necessary? Most likely not, there was a population boom after WW2, because there were enough women alive to bear children.	16
1	Don't know.  The stuff about privacy, free expression, open discussion and humanity sounds like old Reddit.  Then it contradicts all that by talking about making it into a giant "safe space" which is feminist bigot talk for the exact opposite of the first four things.	16

1	The most amusing thing about this, is that she isn't his mother. Children give their mother's gifts on the day. She is so selfish and self obsessed, she doesn't even realise.  Are articles like this supposed to make us hate women? If I hated women, and wanted others to hate them too, I would write something like this.	16
0	If by attack you mean verbally criticize rather than physically assault then sure. Doesn't make us assholes. We wantnto avenge an injured comrade.  People like thisnshoukd be knocked down a peg. Not just to discredit then but also to paint an example of consequences to people who fuck up so people will put more forethought in before accusing people of misdeeds.	16
1	There does exist a very real 'masculinity crisis'.  Men, particularly young men, are not filling the roles of disposable utilities to the extent needed to keep society functioning properly.  This is a very real crisis and it's based off of the changing understanding of masculinity.  Porn and video games are fulfilling the needs once met by being productive worker drones.  The only real issue, and one that's easy to make, is that cause and affect are backwards.  Rapidly changing gender roles with the disestablishment of families and making marriage toxic to men have created a 'masculinity crisis'.  Porn and Video game addiction are symptoms of this crisis.	16
1	that's hilarious.  a neighbor of the school goes to a school play, open to the public.  of course he's planning to abduct children!  what other reason could there be?  of course they don't approach him...they take his picture and put it in a flyer to warn people.     or, perhaps he's just a lonely guy who never married or had kids, but hey why not support the community by attending a school play.  not at *our* school, thankyouverymuch.	16

0	&gt;If she's living in a mandatory arrest jurisdiction, it's not wrong to assume her husband would have been arrested, even with no evidence or desire for arrest from either party.

1	&gt; Increased economic self-sufficiency for women  This is primarily due to laws that have been enacted for unfair hiring procedures and forced changes to standards.   how many more women are in construction nowadays? plenty!  you see them all the time now, holding the stop/slow signs. It's still the men digging the ditches.   and they demand and get the same pay, after all, they're all "construction workers"  There are also many, many special programs available for only women which give them a financial edge over men.  Training programs, college classes and programs. only awarded to women.	16

0	Racism against white people isn't a issue for good reason. For one it's primarily whites complaining about whites to look good for other whites. Second whites have a damn hard time proving ill effects. There is no legitimate claim to victimhood and you really need that unless your goal is to blow smoke up peoples asses. The white rights types keep trying to hijack men's rights. If and when they do kiss your credibility good bye not that you have much to begin with. The case for misandy is strong. The case for racism against whites is not. Pick your battles wisely.	16

0	How dare police respond in a reasonable way to someone reportedly screaming in distress, right? If my neighbor calls 911 and tells them I'm screaming in distress, I sure hope police come to my house and make sure nothing is wrong.  IMO, it's wrong to *assume* the police would have arrested the husband. They probably just wanted to see if the lady was covering for her abusive spouse - it's not an uncommon phenomena in the world of policing.	16

1	So a short video is about women and suddenly it's against men's rights... Would you have been satisfied if it were about the struggles of men? Is nothing allowed to put women in a good light? I'm quite sure that nothing in that video was false. Believe it or not but until the 20th century women couldn't vote and weren't given many job opportunities. What's wrong with celebrating the fact that these things changed.  Calling Google out for making something about women instead of men isn't about standing up for the rights of men; it's a pathetic way of saying 'why can't everything be about ME?'	16
0	I'm just pointing out that the guy who the story was about says that it's bullshit.   The larger point - that SJWs are complete assholes on Twitter - is demonstrably not bullshit. But I tend to believe that they did not successfully bully Joss Whedon.	16
0	Thats already basically what sexual assault is in English law.  &gt;when a person (A)  &gt;intentionally touches another person (B),  &gt;the touching is sexual,  &gt;B does not consent to the touching, and  &gt;A does not reasonably believe that B consents.	16
0	there is a difference between providing aid and forced to pay others debts.   communists and liberals and the corrupt like to force those with money to pay for others debts..making the responsible pay and  the irresponsible off the hook or kicking dirty cans down the road.  college is not the ONLY way to get ahead in society, college is often a source of bullshit. we are teaching young people they have to go to THE SCHOOL. instead of encouraging them to use their own  creativity and interest to find work and to be responsible for their own getting ahead.	16
1	If they’re so fucking intelligent why can’t they count? You outnumber us at university 3 to 2, sweethearts.  Next they’ll be complaining they can’t find men who make more money than them.  Feminism: a giant social experiment in women not knowing what the fuck they want.	16
0	People who think that women are going to come out in droves to be the matriarchs of tomorrow are wishful thinkers at best. Women aren't biologically geared with the same average desire to lead that men have. You'll have your Margaret Thatchers once in awhile, but generally speaking 70% or more of the people who want to be congressmen and CEO's are men. That's just what testosterone does to you.	16
0	It's something people do to other people and not specifically a men's rights issue but rather a human rights one.

0	Just saw it - it's overrated, and yes their is a feminist tone in the movie, but not intolerably so. Every woman in the movie is of course good, pure, beautiful and /or wise as per the standard Hollywood script. Virtually all of the men (aside from Max) are bad. I just found it excessive and nowhere near the quality and depth of Road Warrior (Mad Max 2). It should not have even been called Mad Max. I suggest folks wait for the bluray or netflix.	16

0	That's just stupid. A Rape accusation shouldn't have such a damning effect on a person. A Rape conviction should.  Not to say the false accusation shouldn't be treated more harshly, but I think we are arguing for the wrong thing here far too often. Supporting the innocent (And accused, which are innocent until proven guilty) should be the priority in our justice system, because that's how it was intended to be. It shouldn't exist to support a victim (or perceived victim).	16
0	The expectation was immediately getting slaughtered.  About the same expectation I have of an all female Fire house.    An all female fire house wouldn't need to be "Hands down the single best fire house to ever operate".  The morality rate of the fire fighters in that house would need to be low enough that more women would be willing to join and replenish losses.  I expect that either the mortality rate would be so high no one would be willing to join it or the success rate for saving people so low that New Yorkers calling 911 start telling dispatch to not send the women because we are better off with out them responding.	16

0	I don't think it's strange at all..  Two criteria were needed to press charges:  1. He is a registered sex offender  2. They find photos of kids on his phone.   That is more than enough evidence to show that he is a potential risk to kids.	16
0	Both of the thighs you mention are core beliefs of the religious conservative.  Fiscal conservatives are different,  but religious conservatives are all like that.  Liberals don't have these principles.  "Minority groups" have them.  Black Republicans also have similar Black Rights ideals as Black Democrats.  The same goes for females.	16

1	&gt;An employee in a male job class complains that he is paid less than a co–worker in a female job class. Is this a pay equity issue?  &gt;No. The purpose of the Act is to correct systemic discrimination in compensation for female job classes. The Act does not require that male or gender neutral job classes that are paid less than other similarly-valued job classes receive a wage increase. If the employee is in a male or gender neutral job class, there is no remedy for that individual under the Act.	16
1	its ok everyone she "knows is not fair" so there is no problem right? she can carry on being an entitled self centred bitch because "she knows it wrong".  meanwhile the rest of the world actually refrain from behaviour or actions they recognise as unfair or indefensible, and try and hold consistent non contradictory values.	16

0	Bigotry is irrational hatred, and misandry is hatred or fear of men. You can be sexist without hating and fearing people. If I tell Sarah her place is in the kitchen that's not misogynistic but it is sexist.	16

When I ask them why, it's never anything except, "If she divorces me she'll take everything I own and the kids if we have kids."  This is before I even tell them my stance.  I think your first point is correct. People understand divorce now, and they also understand that divorce is not fair for the man in today's world. This is why young, smart men do not want to risk their futures with marriage.	16

0	Technically speaking, child support is supposed to get spent on the child, not the guardian.  If those funds were being spent on the guardian the person paying it could take them to court.  The courts can also take child support without the the permission of either parent.  A child could also sue a parent who missuses their child support to regain those funds later.  Also a parent cannot come into an agreement that is bad for a child on their behalf.  That is why they cannot revoke child support.  This isn't an opinion, this is facts based on the US court systems.  Other countries may vary.	16
1	I was thinking exactly the same thingsl. "Sounds like the exact same feeling a man gets when he has an erection at an innaproprite or embarrassing time". But then again, men's problems are invisible to her.	16
1	I bet she spends too much time in elementary schools her children don't go to. That's fucked up.	16
1	Sadly though even the military has sexist standards where the women only have to be a fraction as capable as the males when it comes to anything physical. For my job I had to lift something close to 100lbs to a top shelf but for my female counterparts it was a limit to 40lbs(I was munitions systems aka AMMO).	16
1	Uninformed people arguing so vehemently isn't a surprise. They've got an emotional investment that trumps any verified fact in their mind. It's also why despite all evidence to the contrary people argue a wage gap exists and that men abuse women at a higher rate than the reverse.	16
1	nothing is fair for men in this world nowadays.  your life can be ruined, you can be arrested for nothing more than a false accusation.   The draft is still in place, which only pulls from a pool of only men.  then there are the special laws, the lower standards for women, for the same job, and the "equal pay" for unequal work.   then you have the feminazis trying to (and often successfully) destroying the last "safe spaces" we have left, the internet.	16

If it's a 1:1 ratio for the bathrooms how does that make any sense they would have an exclusive bathroom for just 5% of the workers?	16

1	Nowhere near as bad, but it's getting there. An Australian judge recently made a prenup void because the woman was coerced (read: sign it or no marriage) into signing it. It makes me never want to get married, even to the woman I love, because I'm afraid of what could happen to me in a world hostile to men.	16

0	It is also a medical procedure for the child.  Does the parent not have the right to be present for such a case unless there is a medical need not to (such as in intensive surgery where only trained staff are present)?  Notice how the rights of the man are always secondary to the rights of the child, but the right of the child seem to be secondary to the rights of the woman.	16
1	I don't think there's any question she had malicious intent.  She thought he was a child molester and felt justified in attacking him with malice, but I don't see how that changes anything.  She did not have good intentions toward him, or even neutral...She intended him harm.	16
0	well its your business, if it were me (although i dont have kids) the instant you plunge a dagger in my heart and accuse me of such things with sincerity without even a token attempt at looking at a possible explanation (false memory syndrome) you would be dead to me.  if i uncovered abuse that a therapist told me i encountered by my dad, i would doubt it so much i would look for another possible explanation, and then discover well documented FMS, the fact she did instead go with it, is a disgrace and she doesn't deserve a loving kind father, as she left you to burn.	16

0	You suck at defending white men because you really about finding excuses to hate others. I mean seriously she wants 'hand outs'? All blacks want welfare right? I see way too much of this from the conservatives who discover Men's Rights. Not everything is an excuse to run your war against the poor propaganda from the Right wing elite. They don't care about tax liability of welfare, it's the crushing of the classes beneath them who threaten their power. If they have their way you'll see another 30-40 years of stagnant wages. They use the power for themselves and you use yours to advance their interest. Political suckers.	16
1	Why no programs to get more male teachers or psychologist's it seems women just want to invade male majority jobs while at the same time keeping men out of female majority jobs.	16
0	Yeah man, i feel you. Really sorry about your complications.  I'm pretty sure every circumcised man who figured out what exactly has happened to him; has shed an anger tear.  Let's all just make sure this shit stops with us. No "baby gotta look like daddy" shit.	16
1	And everything you just said also accounts for part of the reason that wonderful women like GWW and Christina Hoff Summers are so important to the MRM.    Yes, their intelligence and insight into our issues are the primary reasons for their importance.  But you also cannot deny the fact that their being women allows them to say a lot of things that us men simply cannot get away with saying.  I can't even count the number of times that I've seen videos of them speaking and I've said to myself "holy shit, if a male said what they had just said, that guy would be fucking eaten alive."	16
1	You're being so naive, it's almost endearing.  The fact she didn't allow them entry isn't going to stop them from saying she did. You think they're going to admit to breaking the rules in writing?	16

0	I'm not being intentionally obtuse, I am saying that alimony is fucked up because most of the time when it is imposed on a divorced spouse it is done so without either party having agreed to a contract that stipulates that. In fact, it often *overrides* prenuptial agreements, which is even more fucked.  This a clear example of alimony, by the way, even if you think this lady is being a greedy shit about it.	16
1	I think consent was given here to have sex with a stranger in the dark.    So neither he nor she knew if they were romping with a frog.  At best both parties are guilty of being randy to the point of utter stupidity.  What kind of idiot consents to sex in the dark with a stranger anyway, no matter what their gender is?	16
1	Thanks. Just curious. Probably dumb to even ask.  I agree completely. Cheers.	16
1	Oh what tangled webs we weave when first we contract to conceive.	16
0	Men aren't objectified sexually as much as women are, normally they're objectified financially, so 'FHRITA' doesn't compare in thay way.   Let me rephrase. I assume there are things people can say about men as a whole that offend you. What if someone made a big joke about one of those things (that you *didn't* find funny, she obviously doesn't think it is). After a year of dealing with it all the time do you think you might get tired of it and have someone explain themselves? Would doing that make you vain or narcissistic?	16
1	If you lived next to a hysterical woman and the cops thought you were a wife beater you wouldn't be so thrilled, sharing a cell with unsavory types for a night while the cops figured out your story.	16
0	They're doing a pretty good job at keeping themselves in check if you haven't noticed	16
1	That's a very valid observation. The sort of person who goes in on a venture like this is probably just terrible to others all around regardless of the gender of any parties involved.	16
0	The question is an apples and oranges argument.   Dui, its a crime against the state involving being drunk and putting others at risk.   While the other argument is that someone had a crime commit against them by another person, because they were allegedly legally incapacitated and could not legally enter into an agreement.	16
0	Its not a silly instict lol. Its pretty essential.	16
1	Hey, it's easier than using your brain.	16
1	You really need to learn that not all of the idiotic feminists are fat and not every fat woman supports the idiotic feminists. And with comments like this, you push away women who support the MRM but aren't pretty little things. The fact that you feel the need to say this shit makes you no better than the feminist who would call you a fat, fedora-wearing neckbeard for being here. Get some common sense.	16
0	Well clearly we just don't know what equality is, right? It's not simply "everything is equal for everyone", right?  Oh crap, that actually IS what it is... Hmmm.	16
1	Haha, thanks! To be honest, I think I barely scratched the surface and I'm thrilled with how this thread is developing. :)	16
1	This was best illustrated when there was a wiki article created about Wikipedia kicking off many feminist leaning editors. Except they didn't, but a news article said they did and trying to prove it by citing the Wikipedia ArbCom page would have been "original research".   [Here](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/02/wikipedia_gamergate_scandal_how_a_bad_source_made_wikipedia_wrong_about.html)'s an article about the incident.	16
0	If that is the case, then why was there a Women Behaving Badly flair available until recently?   I post articles about female violence and negative behavior to contribute to the archive of examples of how women do not necessarily and automatically make the world a better place--a very common feminist meme.  I encourage all readers of this subreddit to do the same.  If MRA is to gain traction, it needs a clear-eyed view of culture, politics, and history.  Then, MRA is equipped to counter feminist propagandizing about how women make better leaders, women are more compassionate, women are less violent, etc.	16
1	Right. So a joke.  It didn't destroy your career or reputation.	16
1	Okay, SHE committed a genetic crime against HIM. SHE should be the one giving money and HE should be the one with custody (if he even wants it).  You know who might actually hear us out on this? Libertarian state senators. If your state has any, shoot them an email asking for a law that men should never become fathers without their consent. I plan to do the same for Oregon tomorrow.	16

1	I'm a 32 year-old long-haired hippie hipster lookin dude, and some of the looks I get when I drop my friend's kids off at school **with their father ** would make plants whither &amp; die. I feel like I have to be ready to defend my presence there at any moment.	16

1	What a racist bigot.  The freedom of speech argument doesn't apply when you are a representative of an organization. What the university has really said is that it condones an outspokenly racist attitude in its faculty.	16
0	Yes, by all means, let's start putting children in foster care because they spent a week in Scotland visiting relatives during term time. /s	16
1	I very much disagree.   "We won" is not a "sensationalist title".   It is absurd to portray "We won" as a slippery slope to being a power hungry, vendetta driven, corrupt movement.	16
1	I work as the only male in an organization with ~25 women. No catfights, no jealousy (etc), just a little more tears are shed than normal. It's totally fine. Edit: i meant what user modernbenoni says below.	16
1	Dunno about ever, but I am pleased as punch that Bernie Sanders is seeking the nomination as a genuine leftist Social Democrat. Sanders also has a pretty good record of not having his head up his ass about guns, which is more than most of the candidates on the left can say.  I see his chances of winning as about on par with Ron Paul - he's too far left to get the moderate voters and will be absolutely crucified by the big-money media - but I think his presence during the race will at least provide some contrast to the usual two prepackaged political platforms.	16

0	http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/snoop?q=snooping  thats a dictionary link for Snoop/Snooping. Pretty sure you'll find no connections to peadophilia in there. The NSA are snooping through peoples data, so does that make them a paedo organisation?  Nefarious intent? Maybe, but not peadophilia. So, don't put words in my mouth.	16
1	Considering those phone calls are anonymous and protected, and considering the officers don't really have to tell the victim or the suspect much of anything during the investigation, it's easy to see how that can be abused.  "Someone thinks they heard something" as probable cause might protect a lot of people, but it can harm a few others quite badly.	16
0	Believing something that happens to be politically correct doesn't mean I particularly care whether it's politically correct.  I'm against sexism. That doesn't mean I look at the politically correct definition of sexism when deciding what defines sexism. But this very clearly falls in the definition of sexism, and what's more is a completely ridiculous (implied) assertion without any solid backing whatsoever.  So yes, the implication that women are useless drones who should be "outsourced" is sexist garbage and morally wrong on so many levels.	16
1	Wow ! This is great news.   I'm really rather surprised because I was sure she would simply be forgotten and all of this swept under the rug. Good for Mr. Filler !	16
0	Dude. Spoiler that shit.	16
1	Yeah this is not good. If one of you was above the age of majority when the sex happened then consent isn't even an issue. All they have to do is prove that you *did* have sex with an underage girl, and you are automatically guilty of statutory rape.  Lawyer up and take the 5th. Do not discuss the case with anyone except your lawyer: not even your parents. 95% certain that if you take this path the rape case will go away due to lack of evidence.	16
0	It bugs me that /s is a thing at all, are people really so horrendous at recognising sarcasm? I get that it can be harder in text but in cases like this it's pretty fucking clear.	16

1	He has to appear like he's playing nice with mainstream people.  And since Ellen Pao has taken up ALL of Reddit's PR time, it would be really awkward for the mainstream to feel blindsided that reddit isn't actually some pro-ultra-feminist website led by their CEO's world views.	16
1	This isn't trawling for pity, it's trawling for acknowledgement. Do you have any idea how many people don't even consider that men can be abused, or that women can be abusers? It's a huge roadblock to getting male victims of domestic violence the help they need. You'll notice that, unlike feminist victimmongering DV campaigns, this poster doesn't insinuate that all men are victims-to-be or that all women are perpetrators-in-waiting.	16
0	Even better, stop having sex (with women).  The only reason women get away with all this bullshit is because they control us with sex. If we stop putting out, they'll eventually get desperate enough to change things. The gender that controls the sexual market, also controls the world.	16
0	Just wrote a post in response to this about what TRP is really about. Give it a read.	16
0	&gt; threatened by the social implications of Charlize Theron kicking ass in a movie.  It's more about a movie with an iconic male anti hero being turned into feminist propaganda.  Remember just a couple of weeks ago feminists have a tantrum over the Black Widow in Avengers? Yet I don't recall the press ridiculing them.  These "attacks" on MRAs are just from the usual suspects that continually attack the MRM simply for existing. Let's do away with any pretence if we somehow just explained ourselves differently it would make a difference.  This Mad Max defence stuff is just concern trolling and needs to stop.	16
1	The type of women who would voluntarily join a purposefully all-women job, devoting time and effort specifically to try and spite men, prooooobably aren't the nicest people to anybody in general, not just men.	16

1	&gt; It WAS about equality  Feminism was never about equality.  At it's best, most pure, form, it was about equal rights.  But, it was about equal rights when women had less responsibility and less individual disposability.  In other words, it was a female supremacy movement from the start.  It just became more difficult to hide this fact once women gained men's rights.	16

0	Nah, I vote for a party more left than them, in a country across the pond where there are more than two or three parties in parliament.	16
1	There is always a "dodge" for women. They know that going in. Women will always get the better of men. They always get the long end of the stick. They will always be the poor victims. The poor wounded birds. The proof is out there for anyone to study.  Women are better con-artist then men and they are also the better convincing liars. Women told me that themselves.	16
0	So the person in your example of choosing a woman over a man,  was actually a male, and he still performed terribly?	16
1	It said somewhere about administrative quota. Basically she was passed because they needed more females.	16
0	And that's the real reason you shouldn't be seeing the film, and quite frankly I have the same disposition towards theaters.   I'd just hate to see the Men's Rights side of things turn into the same spite-driven boycott-fest that Feminism has adopted. Mad Max looks like a pretty awesome movie, regardless of who was brought on as a consultant. I have no problem with more women kicking ass on film. People seem to thing that a strong female lead means it's going to become some ridiculous female propaganda piece that shoves female supremacy down your throat at every turn.   George Miller is saving the Patriarchy bashing for the next installment of Happy Feet.	16

1	The trickle down effects of feminist theory on wider western culture has lead to a situation where smug "girl power" double-standardism amongst women is rarely challenged from an anti-sexist point of view.  I've got a better question :  Why do the vast majority of discussions on achieving a more gender neutral world revolve around a positive encouraging message for women and girls and a negative shaming message for men and boys*?   ^*and ^praising ^the ^"few ^good ^men" ^does ^not ^count ^as ^a ^non-shaming ^message.	16
0	OK, let's go visit TwoX and see their comments on this situation.  &gt; This isn't equality at all, this is getting special treatment.  &gt; This is feminism at its worst. People could die if she can't perform her job.  &gt; If any person can't meet the requirements, it's not up to the system to make it easier to pass. You have to make yourself better. Equality is equal opportunity, not equal outcome.  Yes, clearly these are all man-hating radfems...	16
1	I want to see the day when 50% of candidate applications are women, because that means they will finally show equal desire to run as candidates as men do.  All you can equalize is opportunity, not results.	16

1	This story is from 2013. I quick search on her name shows many articles of her being charged. I didn't see any with the results.  As it stands, if she was only charged at the time of these articles, why are her name and face public? Where is her due process?	16

1	When they're playing grab-hammer, Stark goes, "If I pick [Mjolinir] up, I'ma reinstate prima nocta," which, based on hearing someone else ready Wiki to me, means a king can rape any bride he wants.  In its defense, the movie as a whole was about home and family, and Stark would be the character to represent playboyism. I hear Pietro was more of a womanizer in an earlier cut, so maybe that line wouldn't have been so out of place had more characters been outrightly sexist (even for a joke's sake).	16

1	&gt; He said that he understands that in the woman’s mind she probably thought she was doing the right thing, but that her decision was now causing a lot of “problems” for him.  I can't think of any situation where reporting a man who was simply taking a picture of himself as a sex offender is the "right thing."	16
1	Send me the name and address of your employer, and I'll drop them an email saying how you were once an accused rapist. Then let me email all your friends and family with the same story. Then let me set some websites up with the story and some pictures of you.  I think you'll understand then LOL	16

0	You think society means being forced to pay for other people's things? That's a pretty poor definition. The vast majority of human interaction is voluntary, and thus excluded from what you call society. That's kind of sad.   When I go to the store and buy something, am I not participating in society? When I help my neighbour put up a basketball hoop, am I not participating in society? What about when I buy the homeless guy outside of 7-eleven a bagel and an iced tea? Or when I go to work and my clients pay me for my time and labor? Do none of those things have anything to do with society?	16

1	Feminist would be happy with such a world.  Remember, they are bullshitting when they talk about equality.  Never trust a feminist farther than you can throw them (which for many isn't far at all).	16
0	&gt; So you don't identify with the movement because feminists claim people who aren't MRA's are representatives of the MRM?  Basically. The general image of MRM (and MRAs in general) evokes TRP. Rather than bothering with explaining over and over that I'm an MRA but think TRP is awful, I've found it's easier to avoid labels altogether.  This is the first I've heard that TRP and MRAs consider themselves in two opposite camps.	16

1	Anti-gay rhetoric and anti-abortion isn't a conservative principle either, but the right still supports both of those beliefs anyway.   At the current moment, progressive liberalism is very much wrapped up in white guilt and anti-male rhetoric. Neither are core values of liberalism which is what I think you're saying, but nonetheless, the current political left is largely responsible for promoting and institutionalizing anti-male and anti-white thought.	16
1	He made it clear that he wasn't serious (I thought). He was demonstrating how almost anything can be portrayed in a way to make it look anti-woman, and showed that Whedon's own work is as easy of a target as anything else.  And he was right, because here we are.	16

0	Who cares what Israel does? They're on the other side of the earth. Aside from the weapons contracts and shitty cross-political polonation with the US and Britain they're just a small country left to commit terrible crimes against humanity.	16
1	Not really blood. I clean a building so I have to do two women's bathrooms a night and it is awful the low point of the night. Paper towels everywhere, like they don't even care if it's close. The sinks after two days will look like shit with make up residue and just plain dirt. But the worst part has to be the toilets they get shit everywhere someone seems to always have diarrhea, In between the seat and the rim it's truly disgusting. Not to mention the brown bags. Ugh I feel like I need a protective mask to go in there.	16
1	The way a feminist would explain this is that men cannot be objectified because they have a position of power - so when they are looked at sexually, that is only sexual empowerment - not objectification.   As a woman I can say I look at men sexually and objectify them all the fucking time. It's part of a normal sexual gaze to objectify someone. And, men are looked at in a sexual manner in the media very often as well as needing to live up to unrealistic expectations of muscularity and masculinity that can lead to possible body dismorphic issues later in life.   Sorry if I can't write good.	16
1	The funny part of this case is that the judge ruled that when you come in someone's mouth, the semen is a gift, so ownership of it transfers to them once you leave it in their mouth, and they can do with it what they wish.  It's why I always yell 'YOU'RE WELCOME'	16
0	An agreement cannot be made on behalf of a third party.  Child support is supposed to be for the child, not the parent.  This could go for all sperm donations.  The best counter for this that I can think of is a requirement that the party receiving it agree to reimburse all expenses related to something like this and sign their home, vehicles, etc all as collateral for the agreement.  Even then you take a risk.	16

1	Lawyer up ASAP.   Do this BEFORE talking to HR,  your managers and your boss.   The lawyer will help you not say the wrong thing, help you plan these discussions carefully.   This can have much, much more impact on your life than a DUI or buying a house - situations in which people normally seek counsel. LAWYER UP!  Edit: Yes, saving all the evidence you can (offsite, in case you are fired and loose access to your desk and work PC) is probably a good move.	16
0	They can't, though.   Women can bench over 300kg? Women can produce semen? Women can have genetically related offspring with another woman? Women can pee standing up without assistance? Women can hit the age of 50 without going through major hormonal changes? Women can get prostate cancer?  This gender equivalence nonsense is bullshit. Equality is about being fair, not being identical.	16

0	Are five-year-old boys really concerned with who's a romantic lead, though? I don't know; I've never been a five-year-old boy.  In any case, these were just the examples that occurred to me in the 15 seconds I wrote this; I'm sure they're not the only ones. It took me a few minutes to come up with some girl scientists—the older sister in Alex Mack, Hermione Granger, a few episodes of Are You Afraid of the Dark.  But again, I still think parenting makes more of a difference.	16

1	That's of questionable merit.  There is nothing stopping an unmarried couple from having a wonderful life together, including the raising of children.  In the case of a divorce, the man is no more likely to get a better visitation schedule or custody settlement than that of a man who has fathered children outside of marriage.  This is not 1952.	16
0	That's a problem with how the taxes are being used, not how they're being collected. Also, I don't really mind. It's a drop in the bucket relative to other spending, and I'd rather have a female leech than a severely poor child (it would be bad enough not having a father around and being used as a bargaining chip).   I'd rather everyone pitch in a little for the sake of the child than shaft one unlucky guy.	16

1	Suppose someone has a child, or children, and they're all girls.   Why would they underfeed them compared to the boys they don't have? Would they feed strangers' male children rather than their own, female children?   HOW DOES THAT MAKE ANY FUCKING SENSE YOU FUCKING RETARD?	16

0	It really is sad to see how many people in this sub think that marriage is nothing more than an exchange of money for sex, and that the contributions of a stay at home parent are literally worthless.  Don't want to pay alimony? Don't put yourself in a position to have to pay it, it's that simple. You have control over this situation.  But instead people would rather complain and say "if I have to pay money, then I deserve to get laid", as if that made any sense whatsoever. This sub gets closer to TRP every day, which is a shame.	16

0	Even if true, this skates close to misogyny (yes I can use that word) because it implies blame.   All humans are products of our biology.  We ought not focus on just men, or just women.	16
1	I always love the arrests for resisting arrest where someone clearly did nothing wrong.  Suspect, ''I am being arrested for resisting arrest??''  Officer, ''We wouldn't be in this place had you not resisted.''  Suspect,  ''But what was I being arrested for in the first place??''  Officer, ''Nothing, we were trying to arrest you and you resisted...now shut up and be arrested!''	16

1	In fairness, there are far more men in the Army than women. But the numbers don't even matter. It doesn't matter if it happens to men more or to women more. What matters is that it happens, and it shouldn't fucking happen.   The only number here that's important is 18,900 people with a god damn problem.	16
1	This is just part of a gigantic and fatal flaw in Wikipedia.  Their "reliable sources" standard boils down to a giant appeal to authority.  You can have the most flagrant and easily discredited feminist liar, but because they have an academic post or get an article published in a major newspaper, that counts as "truth".	16
0	It almost seems like this order to allow this nonsense is coming from the heads of state/countries or something.  All across the board we allow women off for diabolical behavior.    But yet a man does 1/4 of that and he's imprisoned for 10 years or more.    Again, this seems like a culling of the male population world-wide.	16

0	A fat bitch with a ponytail, this is how I imagine a feminist. Another one is a readhead with glasses and flat chest.	16
1	It's come in in these discussion before. For example, the women in the Infantry debate.   My point is, there is no god damn reason to lower the standard "for women" since there are obviously plenty of women that don't need the standard lowered.	16
1	Pretty much everyone has been raped by this standard. If I knew my ex had cheated on me, I wouldn't have carried on sleeping with her.   I don't see how you can criminalize being a lying asshat. If a model on a dating website insists on having sex in the dark without ever seeing their face, you're a fucking moron to go through with it. To walk into a dark room containing anyone you'd met online is fucking retarded. They're lucky they didn't wind up in a pit rubbing lotion onto themselves.	16
1	everything should be fair game for comedy.  if we stop accepting that and start demanding taboos and "safe spaces" we're no better than feminists.	16

0	Does it have information about male health issues?  Leaflets detailing the resources available for male victims of sexual assault or domestic violence?	16
0	&gt;There is no need to use the word 'ugly'.   Yes there is. Because it describes something real and important.  We shouldn´t allow your emotions to censor reality and theory.   This is one of the main tools of feminists to suppress any discussion about real issues.	16
0	Meh, fuck the double standards. I'm a man, and they aren't.  Go me, and go men. Deal with it.  I'm man enough to not give a fuck if you joke about cutting off my dick.	16
1	So... a young woman attending college consents to a sexual encounter and later, after talking with friends, regrets this encounter and feels that she was raped... oh, and alcohol was involved.  Does that about sum it up?    I strongly suspect that this scenario also describes a large number of false rape accusations.	16
0	There are still less female CEOs though	16
0	&gt;Yes, I used a throwaway. I used a throwaway to avoid people going through my history and going "well, she participated in this discussion, I've now reached X conclusion about OP".  So you came here protected by the anonymity of a throwaway account, yet expect us to be honest and forth coming with our answers to your questions?	16
0	Yeah, that's not helping, I still don't see it. Men have an unfair burden in career and women should step up and ease that. Men shouldn't do the same to women regarding family care despite the fact that the majority of men want to because why?	16
1	She's a sociology professor, I'm not surprised.	16
1	Young men are expected to do the initiating, but are considered dirty and vile when they do.	16
1	&gt; is there evidence that female judges can see better throw lies than male ones?  They see through *women's* lies better than male judges tend to. Male judges often have a nasty kind of fathers-of-daughters blind spot.  Anecdotally lawyers tell their male divorce clients to hope for a female judge.	16

1	Nowadays, everyone wants "the full package", which of course doesn't exist nor did it ever exist.  But with all the media, popular entertainment, and the internet enlarging the possible dating pool to the entire human population, people fall into the trap of thinking they can get everything they want in a one-stop-shopping kind of mindset.  With so many possible partners, people think they can find their "perfect match."  They're unwilling to settle for the people they meet because if they're not perfect, well then the perfect person still has to be out there, right?	16
1	The attempt to redefine the word 'sexism' is a straight out of Orwell's 1984.  The word is being given a new and specific meaning whilst retaining the emotional weight of it original meaning. This is intellectually dishonest.  The structure of our language is such that Sexism means discrimination on the basis of sex, period.	16
0	so, are you for it being okay to make jokes and to say on live TV to f her in the p? or should both not be allowed?   It is a double standard, so what is the desired standard?	16
1	Feminism is authoritarian marxism.    It endeavours to take work away from women that was untaxable, and make it taxable.  To do this it promotes the false idea that women prior to feminism were somehow lacking power, when in reality what they had was independence from the state.  Women's work as homemaker was untaxable and unregulatable.  Homemaker women were as Galt as you can get.  The "empowered" woman pays other people to be mother to her own children, and pays a tax to the government for that dubious convenience.	16
0	&gt; Unregulated, unproven, and appealing to the lowest common denominator.   But, it works.  The thing that pisses me off about that sub though is the alpha/beta stuff.  There's something very ... American ... about that.	16

1	Decades of war games, and I have never seen a news reports from veterans trying to ban those games because they were being triggered or calling them misandric/oppressive because they saw men being killed on screen.	16
1	Why not disallow cross examination by the accused's lawyer?  You could avoid many more procedural issues by not allowing the defense a lawyer in the first place.  If you can only see one side of the issue, why limit yourself at all, and chop off the head at the first accusation?  Or you could consider why we consider evolving laws past the Code of Hammurabi progress and conclude that people are fallible, accusations can be false or mistaken, and humans have rights that accusations don't take away.	16
1	Contact a lawyer ASAP and do not talk to the police at all. I can not state the importance of not speaking to the police. Hopefully you have already contacted an attorney.	16

1	What's worse though, voting with your skin colour or voting with your genitals? I say it's all the same mindset, and it's really frustrating that people don't get how stupid it is.  It reminds me of that bullshit where people get hired or whatever because they're a woman, or they add "diversity" to the workplace, rather than just hiring based on pure merit.	16

1	They aren't wrong. A man's inadequacies are often socially acceptable subjects for mockery, even stuff he has absolutely no control over, like hair loss or stature. Make fun of a woman's shortcomings, though, and you're a fucking monster. That's how it's always been.	16

1	While technically true I find the content here strongly supports an egalitarian, equal societal policy. A cornerstone to this is equal rights for all parties engaged in society... this is achieved here [primarily] by bringing attention to the endemic inequities of awareness and legal protections.	16
0	&gt; Find me one case (one) where a neighbour made a complaint about screaming and the man was arrested for abuse despite his partner making no accusations and her having no injuries. &gt; &gt;Just one. I dare you.  [Too easy.](http://jonathanturley.org/2013/05/16/couple-refuses-to-allow-police-to-enter-home-without-warrant-police-kick-down-door-and-taser-couple/)  It's unclear whether they arrested the guy, but they tasered him although he was posing no threat to her, the cops, or anyone else.   Anyhow, there's this new thing called *the internet* that allows you to find stories like that in a couple of minutes - which is how long it took me to find that one.	16
0	I call myself a Christian.  I hate god, don't believe in Jesus, have never read the Bible, don't go to church, and actively try to convert homeless men to Islam, but I have as much right to claim that title as anyone else.	16
1	*As a feminist I'm shocked the police felt that I was some damsel in distress based on hearsay from someone's vague report about possibly hearing a woman screaming somewhere nearby, and decided to assume I was simply hysterical when I explained no-one else was home, before trampling into my property and over my privacy, tearing the place up looking for a wicked non-existent man, ignoring my protests, and offering no apology except that I was a liar.*  Ought to do it.	16
1	If I recall correctly, she did exceedingly well on her academics. That is why she is being allowed to pass. I personally believe she should be employed but as something such as an administrative posistion until she can pass.	16
1	Call a news agency and talk to a lawyer about defamation. Those people seeing you might never trust you again with their children and it's ludicrous. I'm sorry you had to go through all of that. I'm glad you made it out though lots of cases aren't like that and if you hadn't been able to afford a lawyer you could have been done for. The judicial system NEEDS reform.	16
1	I have even fewer rights than a woman when it comes to reproductive rights. I was circumcised at birth. My former S.O. decided to have an abortion when she was pregnant with my child. I had no input in either of those decisions.	16
1	My bad. I didn't think that it would come of ass being dismissive of women's issues. However, I don't think FGM should be receiving this much attention when MGM is common practice everywhere. Few countries practice FGM anymore, Egypt just happens to be one of them. If we lived in an equal society, we would've stop mutilating both genders. Obviously that isn't true	16

0	There are some states in the US where that is true. I want to say Michigan and Florida, but i am on my phone so i can't post a source. I will when i am on a computer.   EDIT: [I was wrong about the states, but correct about the law.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_recording_laws#United_States) Although this is more for phone calls, and not video recording in public. I didn't find anything regarding that, and if it is in a public place, I can't see why it would be illegal. So, you were right about that.	16
1	Oral contracts can be legally binding too. If she acceoted money to carry their child then she has an obligation to follow through.	16
1	I can't really give you much advice on distribution methods; that's more in the wheelhouse of a marketer than a designer. As for the content of the campaign itself:  - Is the target audience the general public, or a subset of the public (*i.e.* young men, college students, *etc.*)? - In what media do you intend the campaign to run (print, outdoor, TV, radio, web)? - If you could sum up the **message** of the campaign in one short sentence, what would it be? - If you could sum up the **tone** of the campaign, what would it be?	16

1	I think the heart of her problem is that she kept her thoughts and feelings from her husband. Creating a facade and denying your own feelings will just lead you to separate yourself from the one you're supposed to be bonded to as a spouse.  My wife and I are closest when we open up about our fears and concerns. Then we can face them together, instead of feeling trapped and alone with them. That opens us up and makes us vulnerable, which only strengthens our reliance upon each other and our feelings of closeness.	16

1	&gt; Until men are denied the right to vote, dragged behind cars and strung up in trees because of their gender, any such comparison is hyperbolic to the point of absurdity.  We don't drag them behind cars any more. We just let women drag mattresses around campus while slandering their name and hoping somebody else will do the lynching.	16
1	Yup... Must be nice to have the *choice* of mooching off someone else and staying home to become a homemaker (and yet still expecting your husband to do 1/2 the work), or if you **want** to go out in the workforce and get a job, but because you are supposedly a downtrodden class, no one looks down on you if its some low wage, low skill job.	16
0	But it's not just role-reversal and saying look this would be bad. People actually get upset and say shit like men being shown as dumb in commercials is a serious sexist issue, or people getting outraged at tumblr posts. I've even seen people here saying they've gotten "death threats" because someone has told them online "Die in a fire" or something similar. People here are quick to call out feminists for claims like that, but don't question it when it's someone on their side, and the irony that both sides do that is lost.	16
0	If not men to provide balance than at least women with genuine masculine energy/hormonal levels.	16
0	What is it with the false classification of liberal in America? Liberal IS right! Even fascism is deemed 'right', the 'National Socialist German Workers Party', which, along with communism - Stalin - was ruthlessly opposed to individualism and capitalism.   Fascism and communism are both collectivism and shared a great deal in common, particular the notion of dehumanising people and treating them as a category.	16
0	&gt; Is it rape if I pop my dick through a glory hole, yell over the cubicle wall that I'm Ryan Gosling, and have a woman fantasising about her favourite movie star as she rushes over to screw me?  Yes, it's rape. Also, if you know the location of any heterosexual glory holes, i am sure the rest of us would appreciate you leaving a map in the comments.  As for the rest, it's a matter of degree. A little lie, e.g makeup or pec implants, seems forgivable. A big lie, like Oprah pretending she's Alexis Texas, does not.	16
0	No one is forcing you to be a citizen. If you really feel that taxes are "theft" and not say, "membership fees" then, as the republicans love to say, you can "just get out" Really. No one is keeping you here, letting your money get "Stolen" at "gunpoint". Please take your Ayn Rand books with you when you leave.	16

1	You're missing the point. In the US (and many Western nations) it is **AGAINST THE LAW** for the police to enter a citizen's domicile and search the premises without a warrant.   DV aside this is another example of the police trampling a private citizen's constitutional rights.	16

0	&gt; "wall of text" style which, if not for Doonesbury paving the way, wouldn't even be considered really a cartoon.  I doubt that Doonesbury was the first strip to do that.  "Vague statements" is what editorial cartoons are."  Which is why they are crap. Instead of pointing out why someone is wrong they just blow raspberries at them. How such a thing became acceptable is beyond me. I guess it's the old thing of emotion over reason.	16
1	Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.	16

1	Well, you seem o be trying to educate us so we don't accidentally rape people, which implies you at least half-heartedly expect us to be unclear on consent.  Succinctly, you seem to be here teaching us not to rape, and not only is that super offensive and disrespectful, it's one of the primary reasons this group formed. We don't like this notion that we are all rapists in waiting, and we need to be taught not to rape.  So yeah, you're gonna get downvotes, because we're largely to polite to just call you mean names and ban you.	16

1	&gt;There's a place for specialization in fire departments. Not everyone needs to have the strength to break open a door. Sure, it's nice to have everyone being able to do it in a pinch, but fire departments do a lot of things which have nothing to do with physical strength  Then they can call that role "administrative assistant" rather than "firefighter".	16

I notice Charlize "Daddy Died Mysteriously" Theron is in the cast. She is also a close associate of Ensler's. That might explain how Eve "Good Rape" Ensler wound up in the mix -- jobs for the girls.	16

Nixon is remembered as the big hate of the hippies, but it was his predecessor LBJ that actually turned Kennedy's military assistance into a full-blown war.	18

0	I have "looked into" what the CT's say, for years now.  And after listening to them and conversing with them and reading articles and stuff on both sides, I've judged that the CT's generally are full of shit.  They're biased, making stuff up, behaving irrationally.  I don't care if OBL was charged or not; I assume they decided it was a war/terrorism matter, not a US criminal matter.  Was Saddam Hussein on the FBI's top ten list ?  Moammar Qhaddafi ?  Did they have "FBI crime lists" ?	18
1	&gt;Not sure if this is the right place or against the rules but I read the sidebar and think it is ok.  The nice thing about r/conspiracy, the rules are primarily used to remove people from attacking others (name calling, shit like that).

1	The belief that "people don't naturally hate each other" is ahistorical, ignorant nonsense. People didn't only begin to engage in conflict with the rise of civilization and government. Conflict has only diminished as civilizations and governments have gotten larger. Steven pinker wrote a book on the body of research that reveals that fact. The idea that governments create conflict - at least at a rate higher than the "natural" amount (which I'm sure you know based on your scientific psychic abilities) - is demonstrably false, and the truth is actually the opposite.	18
0	Except anyone who has broken the law and is attacking a cop or trying to flee is prone to being shot. That dog was innocent, and there was no need in what happened. I agree a lot of the cases recently with black lives could have been prevented, but in every scenario they were actually breaking the law and in some cases ACTUALLY endangering the officers.	18
1	There's an easy judgement to make. Police are not Judges or executioners. They shouldn't rush into a situation that will put lives at risk. This is a textbook "shoot first, ask questions later" situation.  They put their own lives at risk by advancing with guns drawn. They instigated the confrontation and exasperated it . These guys aren't mental health professionals and shouldn't be used in that capacity.  We need people that have the ability to use empathy and de-escalation techniques. We don't need executioners.	18

It makes sense, the UN is a joke, and ideal does seem do deal with an extra scoop of bullshit, however:  Israel is special though, Palestine rather, I wanna know why the whole world sends to be focused on this desert!  Mildly good strategic location, this region isn't nearly as hard to traverse in this modern age. Not the most populace region in the world, and not even the most violent. But still headlines, headlines always.  Hell, I care more Mexico than I do Israel/Palestine and more people die there, but I still don't hear much about it.	18

I can't say it more eloquently than the person who filmed the video, as posted in the YT comments:  &gt; The truth is that the police are only needed in a crisis, but they are in our daily lives to control our behavior. Who gave them this authority? We the people are the ultimate authority. The cop is not my ruler, I don't serve him, he's charged to serve me. All I'm trying to do is remind him of that fact.	18

I am not an expert on this, just did some reading a week or two ago about it online, and welcome any corrections.  edit: to clarify, I'm saying that I think propaganda does exist and is used and has been used on americans by people in government. operation mockingbird easily proves that.	18

Like the poor dude on the frontpage who said he was shadowbanned for 3 years without knowing it.  He was posting stuff for 3 years a had no clue.  That's part of the problem with shadowbanning.  There is literally no warning or message from anyone that you have been banned.   The sad part about all this is in about 3 years all the mods on voat.co will be corrupt and banning people on the main threads for posting stuff against Monsanto or whatever.  It only a matter of time.  Money never stop corrupting.	18

Unless things in high school have changed significantly in the 4 years I've been out or your school is different, SVP is about HoCo and Prom.	18

Moreover, including "Big Tobacco", whose harm is mostly self imposed, Big Ag responsible for the feeding a billion people and helping to encourage food security in places like India and Mexico and Big Pharma responsible for reducing the suffering and increasing the quality of life the world over- are not really useable in comparing the effects of disparate system like marxism and capitalism.	18

1	This is huge because while the evidence in the case of Otto's shooting is pretty obvious, people have still rushed to defend Officer Ferreira as an upstanding police officer who made a tragic mistake.  This shows that he is *blatantly* a negligent officer, even going so far as to directly kill a PERSON.  Anecdotally, dozens of people who attended the protest in Wyckoff last night voiced their history with Officer Ferreira - some of which included him threatening to use his gun during a traffic stop, insulting a potential attempted suicide victim, unlawful searches, etc.	18

0	Hmmm maybe not create the climate necessary for a police state in the first place. Riots don't happen in areas with good policy and wealth. Liberal morons that run those cities fail their citizens. Then they use it to excuse military force what a joke..	18
0	lol it's an entertainment website.  if somebody deletes a post or comment and it makes you think of 'corrupt authoritarianism' then you have a problem.	18
0	All I saw was a cop unable to control his dog and a dog that needs better training.  Everything else you said was bullshit.	18
1	Yes, but in the sense that the government gives them *more* freedom... The fact they even have reservations aside of course.	18
0	Jesus even /r/conspiracy has been taken over by do-gooder liberal undergraduate students. They're going to save the world with a 40 minute group presentation on what the government should tell you to do next.	18
1	...and We don't want U.S. foreign policy set by "Israel First" Zionist-Jews.	18

0	I agree.   Evolution is clearly a phenomenon.  However,  I refuse to accept that human beings stemmed from a monkey.	18
1	I went to a NY jets game last season and they rolled out a flag the size of the whole field.  I just want to watch football without all the rah rah military shit.	18
1	Don't use Facebook. No excuses.	18
1	That's not necessarily true. There are a few old accounts they use as well only when they need legitimacy.	18
1	Dr. Michael Hudson is a hero on par with Chris Hedges. Unvarnished truth about how the power systems intentionally mislead and manipulate us.   Hudson deserves much more recognition than he gets in the world of fighting the corrupt powers that be.  In this episode of Crosstalk he deserves an Emmy.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J26iLE8DVwE	18
1	Yes but that's as good as it gets for them. Say what you want about America, but Cubans still flee here by the boat load for the opertunity to be successful.	18
0	If you truly believe this then I feel sorry for you.	18
0	I grew up around Jews and their behavior was perfectly cromulent. I didn't become a racist because my personal experience showed me there was no reason to do so.	18
0	I trust the mainstream media over some unknown guys writing on web sites.  The mainstream media has standards and practices, rules, checks and balances, etc.  When the mainstream media screws up, they get called on it, and explain, and lose reputation.  They have many faults, but they're worlds better than the conspiracy web sites.	18
0	No one does. Not even white people because that would make them racist. If they did, they'd realize that they're the worlds minority and losing their nations to hoards of immigrants and "minorities" that are outnumbering and outbreeding them in their own cities and soon to be countries.  Bye bye you racist oppressors.	18
0	People like you.  There should be a national database for people like you. When you call for any emergency service you should be refused.	18
0	Thanks for responding these numbers. The holocaust happened. The fact that this doofus is questioning the number of people killed show how deluded he is. Maybe it was 5 million. Maybe 7. What's the difference. Still a shit ton of people.   I bet he thinks the Elder Scroll of Zion is real. He's just one in a long line of people who has been defaming Jews for centuries.	18
1	Ironically, Reddit's now shadow banned /u/ANTI-PUGSLY's account sidewide.  Edit: Trying to help since he's not here to spread the word - here's the [Justice for Otto FB Page](https://www.facebook.com/Justiceforotto) the owners' friends set up.  Edit again: He's unbanned, thanks guys!!!	18
0	Two different calls.  The call at 9:47 was from the Airfone.  Thats when she recorded the message you hear.  That was at an altitude of about 20k ft.  Her second call was from her cell phone at 9:58.  That call was made at about 5-6000 ft.	18
0	Not the way I remember it.  The 9/11 conspiracy industry was in high gear from the first day.  Everyone applied their standard boogieman to the new event: the govt did it, the Jews did it, the corps did it, whatever.	18
1	It doesn't seem like he is beholden to large corporations like the other candidates, why do you believe that his intentions are other than he says they are?	18
0	Do you believe its responsible to put men and women on american streets who don't have training for civilian issues... Just trained to kill since that is the bottom line? I'm not against the soldiers. They have a purpose. Their purpose isn't to patrol american streets tho	18
1	Why does it matter what puppet gets put on stage?	18
0	You do know the cell phone calls were from below 5000 ft., right?  The technology was perfectly able to make those 2 calls.	18
0	The article never refers to the gunmen as terrorists, neither does it state they found explosives. What's with your title?	18
1	Spend enough time here and you get used to the voting fuckery. You'll also notice you're being fucked with in other subs. Lost count of the number of times I've gone to bed with comments sitting at +15, +25, and wake up to see them -10. I also like to camp out in the *new* queue and up vote every post sitting at 0. I would venture a guess, 3/4 of all new posts in this sub are down voted in their first minute or less.	18
0	Legally, they are licensed as MDs.  In practice, they are quacks.  The scam makes a ton of cash, and it is useful when the state needs to control someone, so it will continue.	18
1	I fail to believe you've paid the police off in England..... That's just bullshit.	18
0	He's got plenty of them but they're all from the unions.	18
1	Every response was a direct tie in to the movie he was promoting. It was clear that it wasn't actually Woody but a PR person who was trying to answer like him.  It got downvoted heavily and every comment was shitting all over Woody. I think it happened one other time with another celeb too prior to Victoria joining.	18
0	Its obvious you have not read the title of the post. Its not what I believe but what others are spreading. Thus the reason to inform others to the tricks by the MSM.   You don't have the power to discrete me. Its nice try.	18

0	Hi welcome to the shithole do you like our ideas	18
0	"Kike"(sorry, socialist) comes from keikl, which means "circle" in Yiddish.  The story goes that illiterate Jewish immigrants would sign their names on the Ellis Island registers, so immigration officers eventually came to say "here comes another Kike" whenever they saw someone they thought was Jewish come down the ramp.  Now that you know more about your favorite slur, use it.	18
0	Yes and a twin engine prop plane isn't a passenger jet.	18
1	so my last post replying to you is mysteriously gone now, I mentioned I think reddit is under too much corporate control and I don't like how things get removed, shadowbanned and what not.  I also asked for a good alternative to reddit and my post is just gone now, in /r/conspiracy no less.    That's the type of shit I'm talking about.	18
0	&gt;Zero of the assertions made were true.  Source?  &gt;The rest was made up fever dream material with zero evidence.   Source?   You seem pretty sure of yourself, surely you have a lot of info to disprove this. Can I see it?	18
1	It was amazing.  It was like watching a car crash in slow motion, and then...just at the end, when all the cars stopped spinning and bouncing around, just as it got quiet, just when it looked like everyone might actually be ok in the end...a fully loaded semi plowed through the intersection at 90 mph and vaporized the main car.    There were no survivors, only witnesses.	18
0	Rule 10. No personal attacks. Removed.	18
1	Yeah, these things are certainly the problem. But, imo, capitalism is the soil in which they grow.   I'm not entirely convinced that capitalism is necessarily a bad thing. . . But the form of barely-restrained capitalism that we seem to have embraced, in which business takes priority over people - that lends itself to corruption and promotes division.   Socially responsible capitalism, if such a thing can exist, I'd the way forward. Worker-owned cooperatives instead of limited-liability companies. . .	18
0	I think it's a communist plot to destroy America. Fifth Column communists moved here and took advantage of our liberties to use them against us. And they've damn near succeeded.	18
1	That lady at the end is most definitely not Christa McAuliffe	18
1	That's exactly what they are doing.  They are trying to confuse the situation and justify stomping on your throat.  Consider beating someone is the same as raping someone, and you'll start to understand cops more.  They want that thrill of destroying someone who's helpless.	18
1	well, that /u/littlehelperrobot certainly helped me save myself a mouse movement or two and a click of a key! and with that I thank him/her!	18
1	Probably a result of that fancy warm blob in the ocean that's moving towards our west...	18
1	Media bias that regularly paints ordinary citizens as violent animals is a conspiracy. Maybe it's an intentional one by power elites or maybe it's a systemic one caused by the financial bottom line of the media companies who need to sensationalize everything in order to sell copy, but it's still a conspiracy because in the end the media distorts reality and people get harmed because of that distortion.	18
1	Not when all phone cameras (and mics and gps for that matter) can be used by the NSA without your knowledge even with the phone off.   Now if you are talking about strictly non-connected cameras then yes I agree.	18
0	So if government can fail and it not be their fault, what incentive do they have to ever do a good job? That is some very backwards thinking. It reminds me of someone with stockholm syndrome defending their captures.	18
0	No, it's not.  Throughout the world capitalism is currently the dominant mode of production, save for a couple of disconnected tribes in the Amazon or wherever.	18
1	While it's very, very doubtful that he was assassinated by the government, it's widely believed that he killed himself because he was facing some questionable federal charges on data theft. Basically, some argue that he was bullied by the government and saw killing himself as the only way out.	18
1	You must be, because I thought this sub was banned from /r/all?  Yet there it is, even when not logged in. Hmm. Cool.	18
1	Glad to see this as the top comment here.	18
0	I think there was extensive, expensive and long-lasting investigation by FBI, CIA, DOD, FAA, NTSB, NYPD, NYFD, NIST and who knows how many other agencies.  I think it's a pretty good assumption that they looked at the things you mention.  Do you deny that a 110-story building collapsing in 10 seconds could cause debris to be flung hundreds of feet at hundreds of MPH, sideways and upwards ?	18
1	[Update: He looks through my post history while simultaneously saying he banned me for going through someone's post history.](http://i.imgur.com/KaCqF0M.png)  I should also note he's a moderator of 180 subreddits, so this is probably his full time job.	18
1	Theyve basically incentivized a more invasive census. You get to know more about your lineage and in exchange the government can analyze everything about your genetics.  Edited spelling	18
1	So, what you're saying is that *you* should be shadowbanned for linking to a comment that purportedly contains PI? Because any other user would be shadowbanned for the same thing. Rules for thee but not for me.	18

1	Fuck these asshole cops. This is about making everyone accountable. That is actually some justice. Usually police get a slap on the wrist *at the most * in these situations.

0	"Don't be distracted by crazy talk"  This should be top post on all r/conspiracy posts.	18
1	I think the real "conspiracy" is that we are having these drills on US soil outside of military bases most likely in preparation for the real thing with American citizens. That should be worrying enough and I'm not quite sure why more people aren't upset by just that fact alone...unless these drills are routine, but I haven't seen anyone post evidence of that yet.	18
1	Subversion of sovereignty is the name of the game	18

1	If you listen with decent audio maybe a sub and  reasonable  sound level you'll hear a lot of explosions that you might not hear under other circumstances. I have no doubt they are genuine.   This is hardly a new release. The original version is over 10 years old. Rick Siegel ruined his own video in my opinion. This newer version is a bit more tolerable but  he should have just released the raw footage. I did like his question for the military "Where were you guys?"	18
0	Yeah, and I've noticed them call people cowards like, a lot. Excuse the arm chair psychology, but I've noticed people who use the word coward a lot tend to be violent and irrational people.  By the by, why did you downvote this? Are paid shills not worthy of discussion in this sub? Or was it dowvnoted by non other than MRB2012 himself?	18
0	As cynical as I am, I follow the maxim of not assuming malice where incompetence suffices for explanation. Keep in mind how difficult it really is to maintain a conspiracy the size of what you're suggesting.   Either that, or keep in mind that George Bush was no great chess player; he was probably mediocre at Tiddly-winks.	18

1	What's next? Randomly shooting people claiming they were aggressive? Then shooting people that actually are becoming aggressive towards the police because they are so done with this shit? If you are starting to have genuine reasons to fear those "servants of the public" that are being payed with tax money they get from you and other members of the public then something is really really really wrong in your country.	18

1	I'm sorry the 45-year old, 16 mm video, filmed at 1 fps, and its conversion to NTSC [29.97 fps projected @12 fps] doesn't live up to Michael Bay's Special Effects crew from Transformers and isn't even an honorable mention in relation to Star Wars: Episode VII.

That makes you fucking crazy.  I'm not a government shill, I would just like some basic explanation. Because it will never happen.

1	These exercises are done every year to allow military divisions from different bases to work together in case they have to do so in war. Units also train all the time on their own bases but when you have a large operation like this it's multiple units and multiple bases looking for strengths and weaknesses on how they perform together. A simplified description but this is what we did all the time when I was in the Army and my unit had just returned from Iraq. Preparation for the next one.	18

Read the last paragraph in my previous reply again. I told you what the term socialism means.	18

1	&gt;People only believed that as long as they had secure lives and believed their children would do better. 99% of Americans no longer believes that. They see things are getting worse and worse for almost everyone.  I'd like to meet these people. Everyone I know still calls anyone without a job a bum, hell, even a bunch of people where I work were saying behind my back that I was lazy and just didn't want to work because I made the grave mistake of pointing out that I am criminally underpaid for what I do.	18

1	By de-localizing the police force and the upper-level decision makers, they will no longer be a part of the community. They might as well be foreign troops occupying the city when they clock in. They have very little accountability or empathy compared with local officers who would presumably care about the city they live in and who have to face their fellow citizens on their off time and depend on local business and commerce for food, clothes, entertainment etc.	18

1	Both Syria and pre-war Iraq privileged the leader's own minority group. In Syria today, the Alawites are afforded a great many privileges in society, employment, and education.  As for Iraq, Saddam privileged the Sunni minority. He constantly feared disloyalty from the Shia and put them on a lower status. Not as low as the ethnic Kurds, who despite being mostly Sunni, were treated like cattle. They were shoved off the oil-rich land and slaughtered so that Sunni Arabs could be moved in.  Just because America's government is bad, doesn't mean all of its enemies are good.	18

0	a) long time ago so doesn't fit the narrative that America is becoming a police state,  b) while reprehensible and disgusting (and ultimately pointless) these were not death camps meant to eliminate people. There was also ostensibly a military reason for it as Japan had just attacked the U.S. Jews and gypsies never attacked Germany.	18

I think the first step is an economic reform/revolution as regards hours of work and firm compensation disparity control.	18
1	The cops have ever reason to want to start a riot.  It gives them justification to make more money, have more status, get more gear, and have less consequences from there actions. The police are absolutely the most likely group to want escalation. When the leadership is not directly in harms way the only reason against, personal harm, also is gone. The tactics in use are antagonistic, they simply need to deploy units to force escalation.	18

Again, judging by Gage's videos and what he allows posted by Chandler, I'd say he barely squeaked by that part of his degree.   Plus, there's a reason all physicists debunk his claims, rather than support them. ;)	18

It won't go at the speed of light (or likely anything near it), although it sounds very efficient compared to what we have now should it work. This would still not be a particularly viable technology with which to travel to distant stars and meet aliens, and as far as we know it cannot be turned into such a technology either. It's still sublight drive, just better than what we have.	18

0	Wow sick burn, bro. You completely delegitimized my point with that.  The Soviet's failure to go to the moon was because of their rocket issue... *not because they believed the Van Allen belts would be fatal to go through...* And it's not like they would have cared about sending men to their deaths. The first manned Soyuz rocket was sketchy and the astronauts knew they were going to die (they complained about several glaring issues before launch)... and cursed the Soviet's mission control over the radio during re-entry as the capsule failed.	18

0	Well, part of the reason it's a race issue is that by and large (1) whites don't mind when cops kill civilians, and (2) whites are dramatically underrepresented proportionally to their proportion of the population. Whites are 63% of the population but only 50% of those killed by cops.   Really, though, the biggest factor is that blacks mind being killed. There is group consciousness on this subject among blacks. Whites, on the other hand, worship the cops and totally support them killing lots of citizens.	18

There's still the 350,000 pound plane and the severe structural damage the fucking plane caused when it crashed into the fucking building.  I... seriously, I honestly can't tell if you're actually serious and have... what, forgotten? about what we already discussed, are ignoring it because it doesn't fit your beliefs, or just fucking with me at this point, so I'm done.

1	I'm not sure Quantcast is that reliable. [Some evidence.](https://moz.com/blog/testing-accuracy-visitor-data-alexa-compete-google-trends-quantcast)  Reddit reports very different numbers [here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/about/traffic) and although I'm being subjective, it really does not feel like Reddit's traffic has been reduced to less than 1/3 of what it was 1 year ago.

0	Having suspicions of the government and disarming explosives are two separate things.  Honestly some people on this subreddit need to get treatment for their paranoia.  This post applies to pretty much every post downwards as well.

You do not find these people speaking in this capacity often, but it is not a conspiracy. It's news, ironic and depressing as that is. edit I still don't think it's a conspiracy -- money needs to be removed from the news media the same way it needs to be removed from politics. Legally speaking, they're just being a successful business.	18
1	Such compensation is free speech, and is protected by the first amendment; except when the IRS decides it's not. Move along plebs, nothing to see here.	18
1	To be fair, it's both. The law enforcement system is wrong for treating the public as the enemy, and wrong for seeking out and hiring uneducated, aggressive, corruptible thugs to keep that enemy in line. The individual officers are given free rein to be themselves.   It doesn't have to be this way.	18

0	Well you're right, I concede. I can't defend the riots with logic. I do wish the protestors could actually kill the cops and soldiers and others who actually protect and promote the institutions of oppression, but they are just too outgunned. Misdirected rage is certainly illogical, but I also think it is perfectly understandable and defensible. Oh well, you've chosen your side and I've chosen mine.	18
0	Okay, I was just saying. I dunno it's just really weird to me, although I guess everyone here has already had many encounters with paid shills so it's nothing new to them. I just wish I could figure who's paying them and why. Honestly, I seriously think someone from P&amp;S might be behind this.

1	So no one witnessed this shooting? Only the security officer out front ? An officer claims “I have no idea who they are, other than they’re dead and in the street,” he told Reuters.  Then the participants of this event are put on lockdown, also not allowing them to witness what is going outside, and the connection is made to ISIS and terror? With a bomb search and everything?   This seems like perfectly planned propaganda. Look at the comments on the front page thread. Hook, line and sinker.	18

0	I didn't cite a source because I want you to look into it. I could give you a thousand links, but you'd probably not believe me or brush it off. Do your own research so you can come to your own conclusion. This is how it works. I'm not saying that many, many Jews didn't die. I'm saying (imo) it didn't go down as history says it did. History is written by the victors. Research the points I mentioned and come to your own conclusion.	18

1	The other user gave you an example of corrupt financial and military aid so I'll tell you why US food aid to many nations is detrimental to them. The US doesnt give the food for free but the government subsidizes and sells it below market value in these third world countries, this destroys the local farming sectors as no one buys their more expensive crop any more and farmers cant survive, creating a cycle of dependency on foreign aid.	18

They felt that post-WWII Germany and Japan would be models for Saddam-less Iraq - a compliant ally and base for future operations in the region.  The chaotic mess in play now can not be said to be part of any particular plan. No one can say how it will end up or who will benefit in the long term.	18

Perhaps every American should have mandatory kibbutz duty every year, like how many countries (Israel included) make young adults serve in their military.

But, when you realize that the overwhelming majority of the black pop. is below the poverty line, and you compare that statistic to the poor's prison pop. percentage, you realize it isn't a color issue; it's a poverty, upbringing, lack of opportunity, etc. issue.	18

0	&gt;Vaccinate 100% of women with this and you'll have your list in probably just a few short years.      And your basis for claiming that HPV vaccines will be lethal to thousands of women within years is... what exactly? We know for a fact that cervical cancer is lethal to thousands of women every year right now, and we know that HPV vaccines prevent HPV, thus preventing 90+% of cervical cancer cases.	18

But just a few years later they came back and took over, and unlike the two charters for the previous federal banks in the late 1800s, this time it was permanent. JFK tried to undo this and they killed him.	18
0	As I said, they define "pancake" as "floors separated from everything and fell progressively", and say that's NOT what happened.

Even more fucked up is that this officer entered your friends property (for what seems to be no reason and without permission), killed a family member, and will face no repercussions. Fuck that.	18

Texas is a state full of hard working people who know their constitutional rights and will fight to support them, and who know that they don't need the federal government to regulate their lives in the manner in which the federal government is attempting to do.  The governor is NOT being paranoid whatsoever, as it is legal to own machine guns in his state.  What state presents the biggest threat to the federal government in terms of their ability to defend themselves through the second amendment?  Texas.  So take your ignorant mouth and shut it.	18
1	We have lost so many rights and individual freedoms at this point, it's going to take revolution to recover any of it. The police presence this day and age is appalling and downright scary.

1	Molten metal pouring from the towers pre-collapse.   The thermodynamic concept of blackbody radiation allows us to deduce the temperature of the molten streams by looking at their color (note: it does not matter what type of metal it is. All metals, once they reach their respective emissive/glowing temperature, will then glow the same color at the same temperature).  The color of those molten streams reveals that they are well above 1400 Celsius (way hotter than jet fuel can ever burn, no matter the conditions). And those towers had no natural gas lines; they were all electric. And accidental electrical arching could not produce that much molten metal before burning itself out.	18

There are definitely conspiracies in this world.

0	Because the people who carry concealed weapons aren't professionals trained to handle these kinds of situations. The SWAT teams and police are. The less organized you are, the more you're vulnerable to attacks.  It's unbelievably naive that to expect the police to just let random people with guns go shoot at terrorists. It would put the police and the general public in grave danger.	18

1	&gt;Personally, I've always adhered to the "act like you're dealing with a strange dog" line of reasoning for dealing with cops. You don't know their personality. They might be aggressive and try to kill you if you move too quickly or especially if you run. Just be friendly and don't make any sudden moves.    I really like this, more people should take on this approach when dealing with police.	18

Where there are large concentrations of blacks, it is the blacks who are doing the crimes. Racism has nothing to do with it. More blacks are stopped because mroe blacks are criminals. More blacks are in prison because blacks do the crimes. Why is this so hard for liberals to comprehend?	18

1	The research the NSA classifies as top secret eventually becomes declassified and then licensed/sold to the consumer market.   By the time it arrives for "free" on consumer level devices, the technology is 20 years old.  What they have now is, most likely, a form of general artificial intelligence. Which makes sense because the time it is declassified and released to the consumer market will probably be around 2029, around when Kurzweil predicts the first human level artificial intelligence will emerge in the market.   By then the NSA will probably have developed an Artificial Super Intelligence, in secret of course.	18

You will beg and cry and plead and bargain, but it won't matter. It will be too late.   You better learn who the enemy really is. It's almost too late.	18
1	It's a plot by old billionaires to feminize the young boys and turn the young girls into sluts.   Worked rather well if you ask me.  No end of gay boys and slutty pre teen girls for those billionaires now.	18

1	Thats the easiest way to kill them all without guilt.	18
0	An indictment is nothing but a formal accusation.  Accusing one of a crime is not justice.  Justice is determined with acquittal or conviction.  To term a mere step in the process as "just" and then try to qualify *that* as justice severely undermines the entire justice system.  *Try* to remember your high school civics class... There is a long way yet to go for justice of any kind to be served.  Edit:  If you think any justice has been served then you fail to remember Rodney King, among others...	18

0	Not all police are like that officer that shot your mate's dog. Perhaps he was just scared, thought he was above the law or just a plain idiot but people posting here "all police are stoopid hurr durr" need to understand that generalising entire police force because of some bad apples is not very logical.	18
0	They're all puppets bought by the same people. Just pick the flavor of lube they're going to fuck you with before taking it down your throat.	18
1	This is actually a very scientific answer and not funny at all. OP, if you are real: get a few rolls of aluminum foil, wallpaper your bed room or wherever/whenever this shit occurs most frequently (more info would be nice), ground it by electrically connecting it to the copper pipes of the radiator.   Or indeed go caving in some deep underground caves, [Norway should have a few of them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Caves_of_Norway).	18
0	I fail to see the distinction between faith in the federal government and fear of a federal police state	19
1	I don't understand why people are against this. Wouldn't you want to know the true history of the U.S. and not some revised white washed propaganda? America is a great place but it has also done some bad things and they need to be discussed and remembered.	19
1	Collectivists naturally prefer centralization.  It's why Democrats always try to bring everything under Federal control.	19
0	Bonjour comrade!  Welcome to Republican.  Where Republicans are downvoted because there are too many liberal weasels.	19

0	You don't know what left and right mean with regards to politics? Lol.	19
1	I certainly agree with you on the need for reformation in Islam. I would say that the main reason that ISIS does the things it does is the fact that they believe what they believe.  Neither Bush nor Obama are solely responsible for the rise of ISIS. But it seems strange, to me, to make this assertion that Obama is somehow more culpable than Bush, when Obama's action was to remove Americans from harm's way, bringing troops home. If your aim is to protect American lives from people like ISIS, it seems like bringing troops home would be a good thing.	19
0	He's the kind of guy that holds up a bipartisan trade deal that creates a sanctions mechanism for pacific countries allowing abhorrent working conditions and child labor...so he can jump the news cycle for the next week and run for president. He's the worst of the worst. Total narcissist, hiding behind the facade of moral superiority and devoid of any practical policy knowledge. Everything from their camp is based on "what ifs," and has no actual research behind. Naturally, he is the darling of r/politics.	19

1	&gt;Oh, by all means enlighten me as to why intelligent design is flawed   Because it's not based on empirical evidence, at all? There's a reason it's not taught in college and no, it's not because of "Liberal Bias", unless by "Liberal Bias" you mean factual information.   If that's really the conservative philosophy of education, then I would be embarrassed to call myself a conservative.	19
1	Reading this comment is like trying to analyze chimps smearing paint on a wall. I can't do it. It hurts.	19
1	It takes money to win and if my choices are between the guy who owes a favor to Wall Street and Big Oil or the guy who owes a favor to firefighters and school teachers then HELL yes money from unions = no problem.	19
1	This survey is absolutely not a First Amendment issue. The First Amendment protects the right to be free from (particular) State imposed restrictions on speech. Someone reporting being offended at another's choice of expression is not an erosion of the First Amendment, there is no state actor at all. I am not here to debate whether we have, in fact, experienced such erosion of the First Amendment, because I know there is a solid argument there has been. This graphic, however, is 100% not representative of that fact. Rant over.	19
0	&gt; Al Sharpton doesn't have the political capital to actually affect "State's Rights".   He goes to the White House frequently.	19
1	Why would we want to make geographical area matter more to politics than people? People vote, acres don't. If a democrat, a republican, a progressive, whatever can convince the majority of Americans to vote for him or her, over the whole of the nation, he or she deserves to win. Even if they happen to get many of the votes from densely populated areas.	19
0	1. Romney was focused on tax reform.  Unlike Obama.   2. Romeny was focused on foreign repatriation of funds.  Unlike Obama.   3. Romney is an effective leader, able to get people to work together.  Unlike Obama.	19
1	Very leading questions.  This reads like a push poll.  The last questions asks "should religion play a role in society *or* government?"	19
1	Oh yeah because that movement worked out really well for Republicans, right?	19
0	Im a 19 year old fiscal conservative and Im very excited about Marco Rubio. I think the Republicans need a younger minority guy like this if they want to have a chance at the next election. Im a big fan of his stance on immigration as well.	19
0	&gt;U WOT M8? Also I'm sure I could find evidence for or against this, but it would be easier to find evidence of the left's fear of a "police state" neither of which I will do. Even if you don't believe this, if you think a Federal take over of local PD is possible in the near future, your tinfoil hat probably needs to be adjusted  That's not what we're talking about.  You said.   &gt;left doesn't trust the Federal government, in light of the NSA scandals.  Unbelievably ignorant.	19
1	&gt;"We have turned our backs to God."  That's where I stopped reading. Stop making conservatism about religion.	19
1	Because of separation of church and state.  The government should make no laws that establish one religious doctrine as law of the land.  If the only argument against gay marriage is a religious one, then it holds no weight.   There is no reason two men or two women cannot be married and enjoy the legal benefits of being a married couple.  You can still have your religion too.  No one is being denied civil rights.	19
1	There are a whole lot of Supreme Court cases decided on the basis of "separation of church and state" that disagree with your statement.	19
1	&gt;"I know you're not supposed to say Nazi Germany, but I don't care about political correctness"  It's not about political correctness.  It's about making comments that people take seriously.  For another example, see comparing the ACA to slavery.	19
1	Uhhhh you're joking right?	19
0	...or perhaps the announcement was just for PR purposes and they never intended to change the behavior.	19
0	Look, I'm sorry. I didn't notice the Americans only thing until I'd filled it in.  It should be easy to weed out my entry from Americans. I'm a conservative who doesn't think religion should play a role in government ;-)	19
1	And all but the last two were victimless drug crimes.  It's also quite possible that had the first dozen arrests not occurred, the burglary and assault charges might never have occurred either.	19
0	Is this some kind of joke?  I have lived under socialism and communism.  Have you?  I'm guessing from your name you are a dirty Frenchman or French Canadian.	19
0	&gt;They're not so good at things like being ethical, paying workers a livable wage, etc.   You labeled all companies as this.  You have bought into leftist propaganda.  Many companies in the USA are small ones that you have never heard of.  Please do research union corruption.  My sources were my sources.  I'm sorry if you don't like them.  You can look up some of your own.  &gt; But there should be reasonable limits on income disparity.   Why and how would you enforce them?  Also ... regarding poverty in the USA... it's way better than poverty in most other countries.	19
1	That can't be done though, in order to repeal it, it has to have a replacement.	19
0	I'm all for what you said, and I agree, but notice that Clinton's donations are mostly from individuals *within* those companies (who still have a lot to gain) not the companies themselves. She us actually about on par with Bernie for funds from the corporations/unions themselves, respectively of course.	19
0	There's no legitimate citation that will make you see my point of view, so there's no point going further.	19
1	In other words this politician don't represent me because I'm the "wrong religion"?	19
1	And she will still probably win....    Go vote no election is a sure thing	19
0	I know Rand is extremely popular on here and I'll admit I wanted Rand to win before I read more about Scott Walker. But I agree 100% with this article - Rand won't win and will make the race awkward for others. Rand is just SO negative, listen to one of his speeches or interviews. All he does is rip on this, rip on that, rip on his own party, rip on Republican voters.   Rand, you'll never be a Republican nominee by completely shitting on Republican voters and the Republican party.  Walker/Rubio 2016	19
1	&gt;Under the old system people would delay treatment out of cost concerns until they end up in the ER at the last minute. Then that's on the taxpayers dime for expensive life-saving treatment that could have been done for a fraction of the cost/suffering months earlier.  This. Exactly. That is why many people are for single payer or universal health care. When people can't afford health care, tax payers end up paying for it anyway. When people can't get health care or treatment, their illness progresses and becomes more expensive than it would have been if it would have been treated right away. Its a common sense thing.	19
1	"I'll hold my breath and stamp my feet and have quite the temper tantrum until you agree to implode our economy, by golly!"	19
1	America is *way* more comfortable with a transgender woman than with that woman named Sarah Palin.  Hell, I'd probably take John Edwards dressed in a shoddy drag getup over Palin.  And I'm a Republican.	19
1	of course they do. Democrats are illegals' benefactors	19
1	This title is pretty misleading.  The vote wasn't for a particular bill.  It was a vote for cloture. Meaning they were voting to decide weather or not they would vote on the bill right then, or delay it.  Because they didn't get the 60 votes needed, the vote was delayed, thus the 'special session' that McConnell has called for. Nobody on this list was voting to 'extend the Patriot Act and NSA bulk spying with USA Freedom Act'	19
0	I ment hillary I knew he was a socialist. Id love to see the look on that old bags face when she tries to say ITS NOT SOCIALISM.  So....what is hillary? or is it like your emails?	19
1	&gt;Common Core will have the effect of making kids more and more liberal/big government types. You will have less and less people questioning whether the government should take more and more control, less people advocating for a balanced budget, more people wanting to raise taxes, etc.  That's ridiculous.   What does K-12 education standards have to do with political affiliation? That's tinfoil hat territory.	19
1	Well, something needs to be done. This country's healthcare system is a shit show.	19

0	He didn't discuss ANY of the things in the title.  He talked about religion.  He talked about being a warrrior against political correctness.  He talked about Marxism/Leninism and the worldwide strategy of communism....  What was so scary there?  That he said he hopes he's not around for the end of the world?	19
0	&gt; The structure of the for-profit corporation in the US is such that it creates a tendency towards, or the possibility of, reunethical action.   There are laws in place to prevent such.  &gt;Because a severe income disparity results in a lot of pain and suffering for a lot of people.   No it doesn't.  As long as the people at the low end have sufficient.	19
0	I would encourage you to read more from the Fairfax website as they answer a lot of that.  From my perspective one of the biggest advantages is it shifts a lot of the burden of record keeping and filling away from individuals and onto corporations who would already be doing the record keeping.  The second be one is it creates a tax code where savings would be given a much higher priority than what we have today.	19
0	The new Superman film seems to evoke the modern liberal. This is more distinct when compared to the Marvel Universe.	19
1	Yes. This is so true. This is why we are slowly losing in this country. Religion is important in this country but not in how the country is run. I am a moderate Republican mainly because I am not a Christian Right conservative. Back in the days of Eisenhower, Nixon, Rockefeller, and Goldwater, religion was not a major topic at all. We have to move the party away from the religious conservatives.	19

0	I never said that its okay to be ignorant, I said it is very plausible that street cops were ignorant of what exactly makes a knife illegal, and therefore he was arrested for his knife and not just for running from cops. Many such mistakes are made, and many of them are later overturned in courts.  At this point I feel I addressed all your original points and now we are just going in circles. If you disagree fell free to believe otherwise, but I'm not going to keep arguing for sake of having the last word.	21

Happend a few times buying a 32 pack of beers (cans) instead of lifting the pack up and down, you can just say what you got and how many and they will enter it manually.

You claim *they're* trying to create friction, when *you're* the one taking offense to the statement that black people are human.

And I say all this as someone who thinks the hashtag is annoying and pandering. Get the fuck over yourself.	21

Registration is because of you commit a crime with that gun they know who owns it and can make sure dangerous felons and insane people don't get them.	21

0	Those are all pretty common traits, especially of the demographic that browses 4chan. I don't get how they jump from that to national socialism though, which seems to be defined by many other beliefs not listed, such as: hatred/fear of Jews, favoring relatively strict gender roles, social Darwinism, and belief that the state is more important than the individual. I'm pretty sure a lot of the stuff that /b/ does would be considered degenerate by the standards of the typical national socialist.	21

0	No, I'm a race realist. I recognize that every race has its strengths and weaknesses. Blacks tend to not be as smart, whites tend to be over compassionate (or sometimes lack it entirely. Both of these are necessary for European derived civilizations).   I can list them for all races. However I do support segregation as I believe everyone did better in that scenario. Look at South Africa for an example as to why I believe that.	21

I was fat all through high school and middle school but I dated consistently in the 6 to 7 range. Until I got married in college. Being fat isn't a pass to loneliness it just means you have to be interesting and actually try.  FYI my best pick up line was to hand a girl an orange crush and say a crush for my crush. Tried that on the woman who is now my wife.	21

0	"The causes of gender dysphoria are not yet fully understood. Gender dysphoria was traditionally thought to be a psychiatric condition, with its causes believed to originate in the mind. However, more recent studies have suggested that gender dysphoria is biological and caused by the improper masculinization and feminization of the fetal brain before birth. The condition is not a mental illness."  That's from the National Health Service in the UK.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Gender-dysphoria/Pages/Causes.aspx  Furthermore it isn't even a mental illness in the DSM.  http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf	21

I played Half Life 2 because it came with the orange box which I only bought for portal (but that's a whole other story) and was absolutely blown away with it in 2011. The gameplay was definitely of a verity I had never experienced before and I found both that and the story very refreshing and almost unrivaled compared most games even today.	21

1	&gt; Black lives are being treated like they don't matter.  Gonna need a source on that. American people of all races are victims are on the receiving end of police brutality and negligence (seriously America, you really need to sort out your police forces). The *statistically verifiable* fact that Black Americans commit more crime just means that they are on the receiving end of the cops' bullshit more frequently. I'm not saying Cops can't be racist, but I don't think it's an institutional thing in vast majority of cases these days.	21

This is policemen, who in large part happen to be white, constantly showing that they do not value the lives and futures of blacks.	21

Mowing x yards (or better, moving x yards. Or mowing X SQUARE yards, arranged in multiples of the mowing device width) is a more acurately described problem.  The problem is that math exercises using real examples often ignore all properties of the real objects involved, making the problem posed inaccurate without publication of all the assumptions about the objects that were made.	21

1	The thing that gave it such a great story was that you weren't constantly switching player characters. You got to know your squad very well, got to see their personalities well fleshed-out, and mourned when they died. You get to see the disdain for the replacement, how the squad totally freaks out when shit hits the fan. There were running gags (Kelly gets seasick, Brooklyn tells tall tales) and interactions that weren't centered around the character.   What made the game good was that it really let you feel like part of a squad, something the other CoD's can't do with such consistent character switches.	21

1	Software engineer type here.  By my reckoning, game development is absolutely engineering.  I would even concede that things like level design can be engineering, depending upon the mechanics of the simulation.  I've worked with people who started out in games and were fantastic engineers.  It's just one of many disciplines of software engineering.  I don't think I understand the assertion that it's not: are people who build gaming devices like consoles and gamepads not electronics engineers?  Edit: autocorrect inserts apostrophes where they are not needed.	22
0	I don't go other places on Reddit, I have no desire to do so. I just don't like KiA being shitted up constantly with, "BUT THEM THAR FEMUNESTS!" related posts that have little to nothing to do with gaming, the gaming industry, or GG.	22
1	I think it says something about someone's character when they're happy to readily buy a narrative when confronted with someone politely trying to open up discussion. And I guess some people picture a character when they see an actor: if I saw Daniel Radcliffe, I'd see Harry Potter. It's certainly interesting to see these people spend so much of their careers portraying characters who stand for truth and justice end up taking nothing from it, ready to jump to the first bandwagon that brings them validation.	22
1	[That whole episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcU7FaEEzNU) (called "Paedogeddon") is one of the funniest shows I have *ever* seen. It's one of the only shows I've ever seen that has ever made me pause it because I was laughing so hard.  Edit: ever, ever, ever. Needs more of 'em.	22
1	'Actually , Its about gender equality between the sexes...'	22
0	No.  You don't get to declare this or that individual has "parted" from GamerGate and 'doesn't count.' The consequence of deciding you want to avoid responsibility for your worst members is that others are entirely justified in representing you by your worst members.  You wanted an anonymous movement in which you can't police people's rhetoric, and in which "free speech" means you can say anything.  Congrats: you got what you wanted.	22
1	As much as people want to blame the SJWs for this. I have a sneaking suspicion that this were trolls that simply want to see the world burn.	22
0	Time to shave the neckbeard off an shed some pounds.	22
0	While deliberately misrepresenting your enemy is just being an SJW, or something akin to one.  I've got nothing to say to something as worthless as that - your actions expose you for what you are, no matter what labels you flatter yourself with.	22
0	So how's it feel to be the world's biggest beta?	22
1	You will find just as many people telling those people that they are mistaken. When someone posted this on 8chan yesterday in the GGinDC thread, he was almost instantly called out, but the problem is: "A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes" (especially on social media)  But you're from Ghazi, so I don't have to explain to you why "listen and believe" is problematic.	22
0	Yes of course we should be pro fact at all time but that doesn't necessarily means that it puts GG in a good light. Not that I would ever endorse us to lie to seem better [Gabe said it best](https://metaversingdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/gabe-lie.png  )	22

1	You're not shaking your head enough to make such a bold, sourceless claim!	22
0	Yes, you are hitting a point: visibility. If we could grant visibility to posts on other subs through the header for instance, would that help ease the gap?  Is there a way we *could* ease a transition and pull it off? It would be worth a try if we had a plan. We just make sure we never do it in a way that is plainly breaking the community. We just have to remain responsive.  GG and other SJW fronts will always have some differences. Making everyone interested in confronting SJWs *de facto* have to do it through GG is just poor planning.	22

0	&gt; "Check out this indie game, the developer is the voice of a generation"  I don't see this implied anywhere in the article based from his talk.

He doesn't even make games, he works at Kongregate, which is a site that hosts browser games.  What's the shilling?	22

0	Well apparently not, some believe in killing all men/inequality and other silly things, while we believe in equity. Second wave and third wave feminism. I'm not the most versed in the history of feminism, but i think the distinction between both is there to be made. Example, the Taliban, some were religious nutballs and some others were fighting for their freedom and not religion. Doubt many of the latter still exist though...	22

Or to put it another way: If we are to allow and encourage discussion of all manner of SJW escapades on this site, it will get increasingly harder to claim that GamerGate is all about the ethics in gaming journalism.	22
1	Yeah, it's one aspect of things, most of us do most certainly refute the frenzied allegations of moral crusaders, but it's not everything. And yes, it's still a fairer description that most have given us.	22
0	Thing is that Jason has no need to know who Oliver is even if most of us do.  Unless he was a prominent part of the GG in DC story his position on this matter has the same weight as anyone else's, and what stands out most is pretty much the whole approval and moderation process of Kotaku which sucks balls, because you never know when that will bite you in the ass...  Like said comment that was either pre-approved or approved.   Edit: Okay, had a chat with others. I think the issue is more that Jason is trying to belittle Oliver, but again this drama is essentially unrelated to the article.	22
1	THE THIRST IS REAL  Chu was wrong about it ending "tonight". It was after midnight, which meant it ended tomorrow.	22
1	Like Ian Miles "Holy Shit, It's Video Game Journalism, Who Gives a Fuck" Cheong did.	22
1	I don't get it. I don't understand why you would care about people meeting together. Even people who have the most vile opinions I can think of have a right to meet with their friends at a restaurant or something if they aren't hurting anyone. Just... why care? You aren't going to be there. It's baffling to me.	22
1	Sargon's beard isn't braded?  Or made out of metal?	22
0	This receives a 0/10 on the font test.	22
0	hE GOT REALLY SALTY TOWARD THE END.	22
1	Yes, but it was a woman, and as a man he has to save the damsel in distress.....ou wait....what side is sexist again? I am confused a bit...	22
0	Sounds about right.  GG in its early days was stoked by /pol/ agitators, now those agitators have found another target.	22
1	"GamerGate 300-white-man raided DC restaurant, police called to disperse riots" - Polygon	22
0	To most people, yes, and especially to gamergate.	22
0	You're like... taking this way too seriously for an internet discussion. Maybe you need to back away and calm down for a bit?	22
1	[Imgurs](http://imgur.com/a/H8L5N) and [Archives](https://archive.is/TJNLQ).	22
0	No, that would be a German political party. Closest to that ("that" being fascism) would probably be one of the third string right wing parties, like the America party or the Constitution party.	22
1	He is misinformed, not maliciously slandering, let him be. It isn't worth getting upset over.   It is also kinda stupid to hold an actor up to a characters standards. Micheal Dorn is also not a real klingon you know?	22
0	TITLE: Upset Neckbeard Says, "Upset Neckbeard"  You mentioned the threats came from 10's of thousands of tweets, yet you read all the tweets from one person @Astojap ... Is it your sock puppet?	22
0	HOLY SHIT! A TROLL PULLED THE FIRE ALARM! EVERYBODY PANIC!	22
0	Depression Quest isn't a game and LW isn't a developer.	22

0	believe it or not. I also don't have a Twitter or a tumblr. My myspace account might still be around though.  I had visited reddit before, but gamergate is the thing that made me finally get an account.   Edit: I made an honest mistake and I owned up to it. Would it have been better if I just made a new account so people would shut up about it?	22
0	Bill Watterson predicted EVERYTHING.  Of course...he also went bonkers and became a hermit, which should tell us something.	22
0	Why do people want to turn GG into chanology 2.0 so badly?  How many times do people on /v/ have to tell you this?   Why is this even being upvoted?	22
0	I'm fantasizing about having a threesome with LizzyF and shoe0nhead. I wish I wasn't such a misogynistic objectifier of women.	22
1	srsly fellas... is it even right to call this "journalism"? did any of these cunts actually go to school for journalism or are they just blogging dipshits who aren't worth the the pixels they're displayed on?  i think we might be missing the point in demanding ethics from unprofessional shits lucky to have a job.	22
0	Honestly I Would defend the game If It dident Look Like such garbage.	22
1	300 people!? Wow, *literally all of GamerGate* was there!	22
0	Same here, I never felt as a "gamer", but the way people defined as gamers were treated when GG started was so annoying, that I decided that the side opposing gamers is much worse.	22
1	WOW IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU SHOULDN'T TRUST EVERYTHING SOME RANDOM DUDE ON THE INTERNET SAYS!?!?!??!  crazy world we live in, where people saying they want black people out of gaming because they riot too much can't be trusted to tell the truth.	22
1	How can you be this bad at journalism?!	22
0	Aaaaa fuck.....it is DarkSydePhil.....	22
0	Did you mean to put this on redpill or politics or something?	22
0	This is a dumb idea. You are not really clear on what gamergate gains from this. This will never be acknowledged.  I am not going to stop anyone from standing up for him, but watching him implode the SJW narrative and both going down in flames is far more appropriate.  There are plenty of people that could direct a Marvel action film. He is not special.	22
1	&gt; A game with a name difficult to remember, but easy to remember art style. &gt; 5734L3R  *cough* "difficult to remember" *cough*  Still, looks pretty good. May be because the page is full of animations, though.	22
0	Remember, there are no girls allowed at Reaxxion.	22
0	Oh please dude, this shit is needed.  Guys like him have done nothing but take potshots at you guys for months and gotten patted on the back by the community for it.  It's time someone calls out that toxic bit of the userbase.	22
0	This is like the gamer version of the civil rights movement, except we're not actually getting beaten down.  That says something.	22
1	This comic does show a couple very good points:  **1:** Everyone (both women and men) make career choices. What career you decide on is your problem.  **2:** These types of feminists want to break down barriers in the workforce, but they are not concerned whether those barriers actually exist.	22
0	I think, that everything below here in this comment thread demonstrates the failings of both radicalized feminists and radicalized gamergaters. Sad.	22
0	I feel like Kia would be quick to condemn ZQ, LWu, or Sarkeesian for doing something like this. [Here's one example of what I'm talking about.](http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2x8wgf/kim_crawley_got_fired_for_writing_an_article/)  Can someone please explain the difference here?	22
0	Dream the impossible dream, bro.	22
1	Yeah, you are better off escalating it to your local authorities, then.  That said, double check if this is covered by your local law. In my country, for example, we have a very strong consumer law, but returning digital products is one of the exceptions in that law.	22
0	NO.   NOOOOOOOO.  We have no leaders. No one who represents the whole community. And I, for one, want to keep it that way. I really, really don't want to see this go the way of Occupy. Not that I don't appreciate the attempt at an olive branch, but....no.	22
0	She's a fucking fraud. Or do you not like to hear that?	22
1	Yep. She actually pulled the skin colour card....	22
0	How is it any different than sending mail to advertisers on Gamasutra or Polygon?  THIS IS NOT HARASSMENT...unless you're using the SJW definition, in which cause I'm going to laugh.	22
1	Do these idiots not realize that 90% of Gamergate is pro-choice (according to a strawpoll)?	22
0	Racism and sexism don't exist!	22
0	Oh, we're calling this nonsense with the mods a "consumer revolt" too now?  Lol, ok then.	22
0	&gt;jew conspiracies and dox.  Did you just classiffy Bernstein/Buzzfeed as a "Jew conspiracy"?	22
0	Hit the nail exactly on the head.  Everyone here agrees about ethics in game journalism. Not many people agree about anything else. By injecting politics (especially far-right stuff like redpill/MRA) you risk alienating people who might otherwise agree with us that the games industry has an ethics problem.	22
0	Then whats my pet cause?	22
1	Go easy on her, she got catcalled five times on the way over there.	22
1	Wasn't that the one blamed on GG?	22
1	You know how you don't wear much clothes around your house, and then it's time to go outside and you sometimes forget that the standards might be different outside? Happens all the time to me. Anyways, it's kinda exactly the same with echo chambers and wearing pants on head.	22
0	Why do they keep calling these posts showerthoughts? This is becoming a bit like that confession bear meme.	22
0	Well, ths is another case for public figures and CEOs, sure. But for nobodies like me? Maybe someone would find out that I got caught with ganja at the age of 16, but what consequences does this have? I just think that this is one huge panic pushing. So, don't panic! And don't forget your towel.	22
1	"GamerGate Attempting To Gain Public Sympathy By Threatening To Bomb Themselves" - Kotaku  Calling it now.	22
1	The wikipedia article is worse in that regard	22
1	"Fuck you! ... Here's my PayPal." should be considered the official slogan of the SJW hate movement.  It perfectly encapsulates everything that it's about.	22
1	Yeah I mean...   It's hard to find pedals that really complete the shoegaze sound...	22
1	*sigh* of course, bomb threats only count when someone with the "right" politics is getting them...	22
1	Of course this article mentions that teleseminar shilling flannel idiot, as all garbage like this does.	22
1	Ah RWS, you're the Uwe Boll of developers, your games are mostly shit but you're such a shower of unapologetic fuckturds I can't help but love you.	22
1	At least they don't manage waste by putting it up on the front page of their website.   bam.	22
1	I like a lot how Ghazi are complaining about being accused of this without any evidence to support the claim that someone from there did it, but it's totally justified to accuse GamerGate supporters of harassment, pushing someone to suicide and also making bomb and death threats without any evidence to support their claims.  I guess it's fine to be a hypocrite over there.	22
1	Sounds like the start of a bad joke.  A game developer, a con man, a ghazelle and raptor jesus walk into a bar...	22
1	Given a choice between his story and lighting the money on fire and watching it burn... could someone hand me a lighter?	22
0	Honestly it was in jest, I'm mean Chu does/says dumb things, but I don't think he is Class D felony dumb.	22
0	While I see your point, that blew up in their face due to there being watchdog journalism and in the end did more damage to their cause. If this can become a thing in gaming media it would already improve things immensely.	22
0	None announced yet. Announce yours!	22
0	This from a guy who raped and murdered a young girl in the 1990s.	22
1	Of course.  It's not as though they pretend to apply the same standard to everybody.	22
0	lol no  there's a big difference between shitposting and bomb threats, son	22
0	he really reminds me of that albino monk from the da vinci code.  you know he spends a good chunk of time self-flagellating as part of his "mind killing".	22
1	"I'm being oppressed and silenced because of my gender!!!!! ^^give  ^^money ^^to ^^my ^^Patreon ^^pls"	22
1	Yeah I am with you 100% - I just dont see any of the shit they accuse us of, for fucks sake our guests of honor last night were a gay man and feminist scholar	22
1	was ggindc trending? they probably just use random trending hashtags to make it seen by more people.  also, the fact that ISIS has twitter accounts at all is hilarious to me.	22
0	They are good if you dont like to tone police people	22
1	Is he a white straight male? Obviously he was just handed the money, Minecraft is a product of his privilege.    Am I doing it right?	22
1	Actually that makes it better. We have it archived and them deleting it only shows there was truth in it and they didn't want anyone to see it.	22
1	I made a documentary about him this morning, but then I flushed.  I didn't realize he wanted a video!	22
1	exactly being convinced totally because of this is silly. But its worthy of investigation and further questioning. Its just intriguing like good conspiracy theories are. Its just important to remember that its not proven it could be true but we don't know at this stage don't go crazy and shout it as truth.	22
0	What you're saying has derailed from what has been said, especially from what I have said if you actually read my other comments. You are arguing with a strawman, which I have seen is the default for gators. GL with that, see you when your grandkids realize their grandparent is a transphobe.	22
1	The word they are looking for us not liberal. Radical maybe, but even then radical feminism is just the language they use to signal who is in the clique vs who isn't.	22
0	If you're going to misrepresent what I'm saying, place other people's exaggerated arguments in my mouth and continue to make generalizations, claiming that you don't need evidence but *everyone else* does, you don't have a case. Bye, now.	22
1	Not enough people have complained about it on the internet?	22
1	I used to replace the stock sprites in GameMaker games. Money plz.	22
1	"omg i dont care about *those* people getting threatened!"  then you forfeit any moral high ground you thought you had so stfu	22
0	And?  You sound like a dumb ass American that thinks the world is just like America, oh well glad to know it's not just my fellow countrymen that are this stupid.	22
1	Yeah because the garbage article that doesn't really merit any traffic.	22
1	&gt; Had there been any legitimate threats to Anita, you can be damn sure police would have done something.  The bomb threat to the college she was speaking at has been talked about numerous times. It's been released to the public. The police and the FBI did say it was not credible.  It, however, was not fake. It happened and there's proof of it all over the internet.	22
0	I was under the impression this was a space for free speech.	22
1	3 hours of this was enough to make anti-gg insane. It drove them nuts the salt must flow.   Need to verify it but could have been one of  them all of them angry enough about it.  More people there than anyone at Wu's ZQ or Randi panels.	22
0	Ghazi is not a venue for debate, it is for mocking gamergate. It does not pretend to be a place for debate. You do. You are in the position of someone trying to claim that it is unfair or censorship that they are not allowed to stage a protest claiming that the Holocaust was a fraud, in the middle of the Holocaust Museum.	22
0	&gt; My point is that your smugness doesn't make you right  Doesn't make what right? Pointing out the previous commenter's completely false understanding of those terms? What is incorrect about what I pointed out?  Again, why are you triggered? Do you have any point to make? What are you whining for?	22
0	Yes this should exist. People seem to forget that freedom is the right to choose between the good and the bad and not just the "good". I'm not in support of this game but I will defend it's right to exist even if I'm not a homophobe. Hate speech is and should be covered by Freedom of Speech.	22
0	They frame GamerGate's existence purely on that point.	22
0	I'm not really following your reasoning. So much of socialist and communist thought stems from Marxism, which, after economics and history, is all about identity politics (social and economic class, "false consciousness"). Are you referring to the bastardized form of Marxism, as applied to gender, sexuality, etc. by modern-day socialists, "progressives", and their ilk?	22
1	factually incorrect...  and yet the most unbiased report any mainstream media source has given us..	22
0	no, * is multiplication, not goes to	22
1	They enabled him for their own selfish ends - like sending a kid to suicide bomb. Sickening.	22
1	I'm just gonna go out and say it: women, in this day and age, have it much easier than men do and they dont even realize it.	22
1	Anita didn't play video games in 2010, that didn't stop her from becoming a "critic." So what? Milo didn't play video games until 2014.  It seems to me he's done a lot more "research" in the last year than the whole of Feminist Frequency has done since their Kickstarter?	22
1	Black lives matter. As long as a cop kills them. Black-on-black violence in Detroit apparently isn't real.	22
0	I think there is space for some cross-over e.g. the Block Bot and Gamer Gate autoblocker) but it is becoming clear that a lot of people here came for the games journalism but discovered a more general desire to oppose the madness of the extreme SJW Tumblr tendency.  I think we should have an overflow subreddit and I agree SocialJusticeInAction is a good name.	22
1	They foiled our dank net powers with our one true weakness.	22
1	&gt;For the avoidance of doubt, anyone who posts on RPS *anything* about the private lives of *anyone* will be instantly banned.   [Hmmm...](https://archive.is/4F017)   &gt;Max Temkin, co-creator of the game, has been accused of rape. Temkin has addressed the accusation and asserted his innocence. It’s all really heavy and serious and it concerns one of the most successful card games ever released. I mean, that game is massive. **So it’s weird not to talk about it, right? Why is no-one talking about it?**	22
1	I guess Vivian chose to go into STEM...	22
0	I consider my post neutral. I don't consider it fair that you consider it hostile.	22
1	It's political correctness on steroids, kind of ridiculous if you think about it.	22
1	I'm pretty sure the only purpose of Black Widow in The Avengers is to show her ass and tits in tight clothes	22
1	There's a lot of ambiguous images. Here's the full video, putting it up on top: http://www.gfycat.com/JadedWigglyFly  Images are outdated, it's all on video.	22
1	&gt; Twitter user Arthur Chu was among the people found **allegedly** harassing the bar patron, Christina Sommers, who goes by the handle Local 16 and **allegedly** supports GamerGate. They had spent much of the day hounding her with questions about whether she knew she was hosting an **alleged** hate group that night.  I think I've just discovered my trigger. Everything, in that paragraph, is either based on hearsay, or laughably incorrect.	22
0	On a serious note, the A group is completely unnecessary	22
1	Kids are like dogs. They become miserable if you don't discipline them, but they're almost always too stupid to impose self-discipline if the need arises.	22
1	Heh an ISIS twitter account just made a threat using #ggindc. It would be totally epic if the FBI pursued the angle that Chu's tweet and ISIS's tweet might possibly be related and seized his computers and account to pour over everything to make sure he's not providing support to ISIS.	22
0	Who cares and what do you expect?  So you decide to publicize his book further?  Let it fucking sit there in obscurity, never to be seen by anyone.  Now he gets to claim harassment or whatever.  He and his book will now get more publicity.  8 months in and some of you just can't seem to grasp such a simple concept.	22
0	&gt;Removing all posts which aren't gaming or ethics-related.  This one please.	22
1	Related to this, perhaps?  https://archive.is/44ZJu	22
0	No one is wrong. Manno said we opened a dialogue and we did. but it's not the right kind of dialogue for a precious snowflake like you. So no one cares. I'm officially checking out of this conversation. BTW your post got autoflagged for abuse by automod, so I'll let the other mods check out your tirade -- you already have a Rule 1 strike on your account for abuse.	22
1	But that's cheating!	22
0	To be fair about Mirror's Edge's sequel, Sarkeesian was "advising on" (read: meddling with) that game's development.	22
1	Boogie is just the ultimate fence-sitter. It's not even neutrality at this point, it's just not having anything interesting to stay.	22
1	I shouldn't be surprised that they take painfully obvious trolling seriously...but I'm still moderately surprised they take painfully obvious trolling seriously.	22
0	nearly 10 years ago !	22
1	I thought Sargon did very well. I was surprised Pakman didn't seem to recognize there's a difference between not knowing if you have stocks in a company and reviewing your roommate/lover's video game with no disclosure. Common sense goes a long way.	22
1	no, hes a shill.  Hes just not an idiot.  He still allows his personal bias to direct all his actions, he just lets his audience know thats what hes going to do as well.  Its about as good a your gonna get with media personalities.	22
0	\*spit-take*  Well played, my friend.	22
0	If you did nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide. If you did something wrong and you're being real about it, you have nothing to hide. If you have a gun, you don't have a problem with unwanted visitors. I don't know why doxxing is such a problem.	22
0	None ever adopted it as a real thing.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droit_du_seigneur  "There is no evidence of the alleged right in medieval Europe"	22
1	Yeah I remember, RPS was pretty much at the centre of it. It was during the short period of radio silence when I was expecting them to go "Shit, we've looked at this and we can see how it might look to you guys, let's all chill out, we'll add disclaimers where appropriate, and things can get back to normal."  Then... all the gamers died.	22
0	SJW has an objective definition independent of personal emotion or opinion. Do you need it? Do you seriously not know?	22
0	Don't fucking blur that shit out, they did this in a public forum, no reason to not name and shame these hateful, abusive people.	22
1	Basically, aGGro got us a round of free drinks.	22
0	The codes are legit or else they would not work at all. CDP knows who the original buyer was. Only way the keys can be of unknown origin is if a CDP employee stole them and erased all traces of their existence. GMG is a legit business that deals directly with many publishers and developers, the probability that the keys are not legit is close to zero. If anything illegal was going on CDP would have lawyered up days ago and GMG would have gotten a C&amp;D by now, GMG is not some Russian or Brazilian shop that is out of legal jurisdiction for CDP.	22
0	It wasn't just Milo. A lot of people on Twitter are comparing it to the ProteinWorld incident,  the bomb threats to the MRA conference last year, and the two other MRA events where fire alarms were pulled. Of course it's conjecture, but I acknowledge that in the article.	22
1	Also known as Grace Lynn. Also known as Devi Ever.  She seems to need a new name every other month.	22
1	I dunno.  You'll have to ask Tim.  Check the youtube link.	22
1	She is, I really couldn't have asked for a better mentor. :)	22
0	Personally, I've largely resorted to Slate and Spiked Online for foreign news.  And even then, I tend to take most if not all news sites with a grain of salt. After all "trust but verify" is applicable to mainstream and alternative sources.	22
1	Main Twitter turn on.	22
0	I always love seeing pictures of the opposition that loves calling us racist and sexist. So lovely to see so many white faces in one place.	22
1	They never listen to you when you tell them.	22
1	Oh my god that article was hilarious! I actually literally laughed out loud. Anyone who actually believed that stuff was real is weapons-grade retarded.  It sounded like the "cabal" people were trying to sound as rdicidulous as possible. I bet they were shocked anyone actually believed it was real.	22
1	I guess they missed the part where people waited, let the cops do their thing, got to go back in when it was cleared, and got free drinks and continued their meeting.  Just ask them how Sarkeesian's talk went after police determined there was no credible threat ; ).	22
0	there you go expecting evidence from ghazi	22
1	"I'm a marginalized trans person and thus a persecuted minority! I think the world owes ME just for my continued existence! You should coddle me, despite me acting like a petulant child! What, you won't give me money? FUCK YOU."  I hate this attitude. I hate it. No on owes you anything just for existing. Is your life hard? Good. Same as everyone else.	22
1	Well, as for the fear of being "chanology" I disagree with it.  Don't be cringey stupid meme-tards and you won't be Chanology.   Just show up and have fun. Thats all that is needed.	22
0	No need for the multiple threads about Whedon, there is one already. Just add new info to that.  http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/34ulmc/off_topic_humor_sjws_turn_on_whedon_whedon_blocks/	22
0	ITT:  People try to justify why literally everything should be relevant to gamergate.	22
1	He totally threw that in to make the radicals angry.	22
0	&gt; Did you ignore this because it threw you out?  Nope, calling you out on your bullshit. You can't answer any questions or back up any of your claims. You're merely backpedaling and incompetent of supporting your own statements - stop deflecting with questions. Prove yourself. Until you support a single one of your claims, you have no point, no evidence, nor any education or clue what you're talking about.	22
1	Don't know if anyone expected anything different from Walker. Even putting aside what he's said about GG he's been pretty hardcore SJW for several years and regularly refuses to admit when he's wrong.	22
0	They didn't create unethical behaviour so that's completely false.	22
0	[But their ad got pulled from London's metro system for being offensive...] (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11571978/Beach-body-ready-campaign-to-be-investigated-by-watchdog.html)  EDIT: There's one line in the article that I must have missed or interpreted differently saying that it's coming down in 3 days and can't go back up in its current form.	22
0	Before you Upvote or discuss this with him, remember that he thinks that Open Source Software and Modding are **communism**: http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/33vbrc/gabe_newell_actually_money_is_how_the_community/cqopc9o  Holy shit, all the downvotes, did this Sub successfully get taken over by the fucking pod people? http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1078/718933691_1b96fe6dee.jpg	22
1	&gt;for safety purposes   ahahahahahahahahah	22
1	Hey journos! a bunch of gamers including women and minorities were just threatened with a bomb. I can expect a report on this in a day or 2 right?.....right?	22
1	Well Friend of Ghazi I will agree that that is true. If someone chooses too judge us based off of the nonsense of bad people because we are leaderless you can say that. If we had a leader than that leader would have been slandered. The truth is is that it wouldnt matter if we had a spotless leader or not. Whatever serves the narrative is what serves the narrative. But at least here in Kia we will debate you. You know how long dissenters and those who disagree over in ghazi last? If you ever decide you want to know go over there and disagree with something someone says.	22
0	If my phone number were in that I definitely would. :)	22
0	Well, he is Swedish. He's genetically predisposed to caving in to feminists.	22
1	All of us, then.	22
0	Why add more tags when there are already subreddits for the topics that wouldn't fall under core GG though? So instead of keeping things easily browse-able for people who want to get news on GG and GG only, you would rather further clutter the subreddit with more tags?   On top of that, a good majority of topics never even tag themselves, meaning if this is going to be effective, it would end up putting *even more* work on the mods shoulders.	22
0	Right back at you, /r/shitredditsays is that way ----&gt;	22
1	Their bombs targeted at their opponents (ie the Tory party conference) were designed to kill. The bombs targeted at the public (ie Manchester) were, at least as far as they claimed, aimed to cause fear and disruption towards infrastructure rather than kill members of the public. Hence why bomb threats were called in advance of the latter but not the former.	22
1	He also attepmts to give up everything to save one innocent, when we know he has so much to lose.  He went from being completely sub-servant and literally a slave to someone who keeps everything and everyone together without anyone really realising it.  Also AoU was a bit of a letdown, it was mostly just the same film as the first with a different situation.  Oh the bad guy is going to attempt to drive us apart, we better stick together and work as a team to win.	22
1	Extremism is a hell of a drug.	22
1	They are endorsing it:  &gt;**To some extent, these third-party tools are doing work that social networks themselves should be doing.**  This is a normative statement. They think the tools are doing work that social networks should be doing.	22
0	&gt; GG is still about ethics but not exclusively so or pigeonholed to "ethics in games journalism."  Not according to the sidebar. Besides, the name "gamergate" implies it's about, y'know, gaming. But apparently it isn't. And GG at large is lying to hapless gamers who don't understand what their signing up to are falling victim to "fighting a culture war" when they just wanted to enjoy videogames from an unbiased press.	22
0	Yeah obviously this is a shitty game but this has me worried for the future of indie games when game bloggers can gatekeep content by creating controversy.	22
0	&gt; Trying to educate everyone here who didn't already know about this?  That's another thing that feminists and SJWs love to do...	22
1	&gt;"If I had to read just one more article humanizing MRAs, GGers and the like, I'd probably have quit the internet for the day."  While I know this is a lie, since the person would never read an article as doing such things as it would trigger them, in a hypothetical world where people were open minded, I still have trouble believing they would run across such articles, the media narrative is pretty solid, but  would like to know what those articles where and where they found them in the circles they hang out in and the news sources they use.	22

1	&gt;supposed "bomb thread"  So is he trying to say the bar wasn't evacuated, and cops didn't sweep it? Didn't happen? All hearsay?	22

Pao seems like a pretty horrible person but there hasn't been any indication that she's been responsible for any of the problems that the community has had with the site.  &gt;Also, my building has terrible cell reception.  Iktf, also you've done it again.	22
1	can i suck your dick bot  please respond	22
1	Lot of unfair criticisms here. He does end up disclosing his bias against gamergate at the end of the article, so I'd only take ~5 points off for that. Also don't see anything wrong with the word apparent, as the it is rather confusing given the fire alarm. His only major crime is saying that participants of gamergate harass kotaku, maybe 15 pts off. Its a B- in ethics.	22
1	Not if that information is currently part of an ongoing/pending investigation.	22
0	Yes, the person who replied to that comment brought up some interesting points.  Overall it's a good example that dialogue, not shaming, is the way to go.	22
1	Milo's hair is just so fabulous, I can't even...	22
0	That's a fair criticism. I apologize for not taking the time to check if it was still in effect. I was using the archive link posted at me after all.	22

Removing it for it's poor quality is more defensible but even then I'm one of those weird people who would like every game ever to be on Steem.   All that said. I don't want to pick a fight with Valve over this simply because we'd loose. As the saying goes: Pick your battles.	22
1	I'm not alone here in the lions den!	22

1	"Rowdy gamergate mob led by militant grandmother and Draco Malfoy accused of false flagging" buzzfeed	22
1	Here is the difference as I see it:  "Fake" bomb threat = no evidence of a bomb threat and no response by legitimate authorities.   Bomb Threat = cops empty an entire building on the streets.   Had there been any legitimate threats to Anita, you can be damn sure police would have done something.	22
0	This isn't humor. Whedon was uninformed and too cock-sure of his own opinion, that's to be sure. But we shouldn't celebrate him getting dogpiled by SJWs.	22
1	Except it's not effective at all.  It's divisive and breeds resentment.  Can't tell you from personal experience how many people tell me, once they're comfortable with me, how they don't like how gay people are always making such a big fuss about gay issues.  But that's not how it really is, it's just how the media paints us.  They don't fight prejudice, they incite it.	22

0	Ironically that is *exactly* what "teh Joos" are on /pol/  Lurk there and read for a while:  Their group consensus is:  1 - Natural law (law of the jungle) dictates who is "superior"  2 - Jews control everything  The silent conclusion as they bash jews is:  *3 - Jews are superior, a "chosen" people*  Ironically, these anti-semites appear to be the only people officially holding this view, as (Just like any fundamentalist religious beliefs) the hebrew texts advocating point 3 haven't been taken literally by any appreciable number of jews in centuries.	22

0	I disagree. Unless the block bot people are doing their shit for money, or making very specific, damaging lies that at not questions of opinion (such as the people on their list being convicted of crimes) I think they should be allowed to be idiots. I'd much rather be at the mercy of an unhinged SJW than a lawyer with money to waste and a grudge to pursue.	22
0	I hear it thrown around a lot.  Not sure how much basis there is for it actually being true.	22
1	Yup, which makes this whole thing ridiculous. If you are a woman who is actually getting paid less than a man for the same job and you both have the same amount of experience, then go find a lawyer.   It's funny that they can't seem to find these women in the real world to trot out as examples. That right there tells you how BS this whole thing is.	22
0	I don't understand, why are they now bullying Josh Whedon? And why are you folks taking pleasure in it?	22
0	They other 8 are fake twitter accounts.	22
1	Well when they define censorship as "government coming and knocking your door down and arresting you for what you write", and all they want to do is embolden insane people to murder the people they hate and tell people that "if they didn't want to get murdered, they shouldn't have triggered people".	22
0	Just to point out, SJW's are a minority - most people at Universities don't buy into their shit.	22
0	&gt; Hint: Mentioning "Reviews for Sex" or "Polygon Bayonetta 2 review" is an automatic fail.  Yes, we must at all costs avoid letting the GG representatives be *actually representative* of what GGers think.	22

0	If you think anonymous participation in a subReddit is somehow a badge of shame that effects me, your even more deluded than the rest of your brethren.   Most of them are at least aware enough to know that gamerGate has become a bad joke ( if it ever was anything else).  Simple test: which side of the debate is invited to openly discuss game design and culture with developers and publishers?	22
1	If I have gotten anything out of GG since last August it's that I've learned not to trust any journalist or media organization without a buttload of scrutiny.   Seeing as how most of them seem to be the kool-aid drinking, lying-cunt-type it's saved me a bit of time just completely ignoring them.	22

1	&gt; Heh an ISIS twitter account just made a threat using #ggindc.  IS THIS REAL LIFE	22
0	I can't even begin to understand how to use tumblr.   You make a good point though. Perhaps saying GG is a blanket hate groups is too much of a generalization. It seriously bothers me that there isn't any kind of condemnation for the harassment that occurs in its name. It reeks of silent approval.	22
0	Being a deeply committed feminist isn't the same as being a wannabe on tumblr. One has merit and can do constructive shit, the other absolutely refuses to do so by default.  Actual feminism has merit. It just lacks representation these days because "allahu ackbar, Rapist!"	22

0	&gt; Most conservatives are classical liberals (or at least an evolution of that).   I'm not sure that's true. Social Conservatism is strong and seems to be gaining strength.  &gt; Yeah, when people say "rights" they are talking about a set of defined and agreed rights such as the right to freedom of speech.   As others have pointed out, ideologies against equality tend to have that taken away.  You could say that's what #GG is all about.	22
1	Instead of grinning &amp; bearing the burden to move on.	22
0	&gt; there's nothing wrong with being kinky  Disagree. This is the attitude that leads people to list all their sexual perversions on their Twitter account. "Demisexual polyamorous BDSM kinky asexual". There's nothing wrong with some good "kink-shaming", as the SJWs call it.	22

0	You do realize that's the exact argument Anita uses right? You seem to be mad that it's a story about lesbians, not that it's just a bad story about lesbians "It's annoying because so much of it is based on the homosexuality." Is what you lead with, not the bit at the end "the story (and the game itself, given its format) is forgettable at best."	22
0	We certainty co-ordinated a great deal to get our complaints heard with O:DN in the beginning. I remember the daily info graphics, and the urges (even now) to send emails and tweets (and where appropriate, to phone them).	22
0	&gt; ps. Dont forget babies  usable as silencers like cats are in Postal 2. And let's be honest here. Cats are worth more protection than babies anyway. So if cat-silencers can be in video games. Baby-silencers should have been made available before that.	22
1	Buzzfeed is like The Onion, but not funny.	22

1	Is blowing up the capital part of their plan?	22
0	I didn't watch the interview, got no time for youtube links.  Not sure what she said and it's possible I jumped the gun.    But treating the idea as "ironic" because she hasn't always been a woman and somehow doesn't understand it is ridiculous; she's talking about events from after she transitioned and about society at large, no?  She may be disingenuous about what's happened, but she's not disingenuous because she didn't spend long enough as a woman.	22
0	That reply makes 0 sense. You didn't start the fire so you better go burn down the house next to it instead of putting out the fire? No point in trying to be #deep by spouting completely irrelevant and unrelated lyrics.	22

0	IGN being IGN. What did you expect?  At least their clickbait is not on Kotaku's level of BS.	22

0	wouldn't that fit better in /r/KiAChatroom then?	22
0	No, that is how *you* judge a forum, not how everyone does.   And it is utterly inappropriate to some forums, and even some topics.   You do not march into a school and demand that they entertain your arguments in favor of pedophilia.    The  fact that you think arguments are won, or rightness determined,  by how many accounts have-however temporarily-attended to your sub-Reddit is just icing on the cake of your  miss understanding of the situation .	22

1	&gt;The bomb threats made against gamers  I mean, he's technically right. Anita is not a gamer.	22
1	16 days ago. You know, I've seen many videos taking about the big red fire alarm before, I saw many videos about the radfem blockade against Farrel's speech. I saw videos about the badgers getting kicked out of calexpo, then getting the cops called on them.  Why didn't I expect this to happen? How many times it will take before I learn that these fuckers are becoming predictable as hell? When will I understand that they take "no bad tactics" seriously?	22
1	I tried to click the link to "meet-up.bar". I feel stupid	22
0	&gt;In the real world, discrimination of all sorts, including gender and racial, is at least recognized and some action is being taken against it. But when online, discriminators can hide behind veil of anonymity, which means they have less accountability for their actions than in their offline lives.  I like this "pearl of wisdom" dropped in there.	22
1	We were making bomb jokes almost immediately after the bomb threat was verified by the police over there.  "So I guess you could say this meetup was THE BOMB?"  At the same time, we also can use this as a valid talking point against those who used the Utah incident as a reason to villify us.  We know how to play both sides of the game and we have no problems poking fun at our own stupidity.  "KoP verified it" is a goddamn meme within GG, for fucks sakes.	22
0	That's true, and as far as an actual plan, I would plan to promote top posts from /r/FuckOffSJWs (lol that was available I just snagged it) or  wherever, from the front page of KiA. Trickle people in that direction.  We can get people moving in that direction from more communities than just GG, get it?	22
0	Remove all posts which aren't gaming or ethics related.  Seriously, that is why /r/tumblrinaction and /r/kiachatroom exists. Otherwise I'm gonna start posting rugby threads and anime threads because they are just as on topic as "look at what this crazy SJW said" threads.	22

0	&gt; you are in an ever-widening culture war that you are not winning  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯	22
1	Its odd, isnt it. Ive also noticed that suddenly sex positive feminists are right wing and sex negative are left wing? ... no.  Basically anyone who is socially liberal, with free speech, with egalitarianism, and with views on sex, is now called a conservative?? Who are they trying to fool?	22

1	It's a parody of a scene from the GamerGate-related Law and Order SVU episode.	22
1	So just because we take graphics programming instead of comms/networking and instead of some general arts class, we take something like 2D/3D animation, it's a significant difference?   Really the only difference is our gen-ed credits are fulfilled by more specific classes and we take different upper-level programming courses that are more development based.	22
1	Honestly I think Pakman KNOWS about ZQ being a horrible character but just being willfully ignorant.  If he didn't know about it and being the first time hearing about it, he would have been like "What? You for real? Can you send me some links?"  His facial expression and tonality weren't at ALL surprising. He acted as if he already knew about it. As matter of fact, he acted somewhat smug that Sargon have brought it up.   BUT his speech/words is about how he don't know anything about it.	22

1	He tells them he can transform at will, not control it.	22
0	I'm going to blindly assume you're from the US and try to put this in US terms.  You have the NSA spying on everyone including the citizens from the country they ostensibly serve. The US also has Scientology attempting to ruin the lives of anyone that opposes them. More historically, you've had the 'Reds under the beds' scare.  Mix it together, shake it a bit, and you've pretty much got the stasi.	22
1	He's quite a handsome fellow too. Awesome beard, Sargon.	22
0	I'm not sure to be completely honest. Lack of access to jobs? Lack of access to education?	22
1	So a bunch of Asian/White males are calling up a place and saying that a Woman (Sommers) and Homosexual man (Milo) are leading a misogynistic/homophobic hate group gathering at their restaurant.   How do we arrive at these small points of extreme irony and still have these idiots try to maintain the narrative with a straight face. Man, Chu--just admit you don't like us; and explain it that way, at least be honest.	22
0	Sure seems like it wants you to take it seriously. There's nothing tongue in cheek about it that I can see.	22
0	Ethics reform is and should remain our primary focus. SJW's will be weakened by a games journalism with stronger ethics considerations, but the reverse is not guaranteed. Removing SJWs alone would not fix the flaws of the system that has enabled them to secure such an inordinate influence over the industry.	22
1	Milo likes being right. I'm pretty sure it's that simple.	22
0	They might have an agenda but it has nothing to do with video games. We're not here to fight for men's rights - this kind of stuff divides the community.  This really isn't the appropriate place for this stuff.  The more this stuff gets pushed on this sub the more we have to talk about moving posts to a different subreddit. Please respect that there are people who don't want mens' rights struggles forced upon them in the same way we don't want radical feminism's struggles forced upon us in video games.	22
0	Guilt? Who said anything about guilt? Is being a SJW a crime?	22

0	It's like a rorschach test. My answer would be, "I don't know."	22
1	I actually use the name buzz killington mostly ironically, i am the type of person to crack awkward jokes at funerals, the grocery store and everywhere in between.  That, and because I played a Powertech in SWTOR which could effectively 3-4 shot most people, so I figured the name was adequate.  I'm very rarely representative of my name :P	22
1	Well honestly, this tweet:  &gt;I'm a marginalized trans developer and I think you owe me reparations for having slain me this morn  does sound like it's meant to be an over-the-top parody. The rest kind of ruin it though.	22
0	You know, though, it really isn't much of a story. Sure, if the parties were reversed (aGGros meet up disturbed by bomb threat) it would be a shit storm, but should it be?  Think about it.  This is simply an informal get together at a bar.  Some asswipe calls in a bomb threat.  Yawn.  If it turns into a world tour by @Nero and Christina Hoff Summers and they draw huge crowds everywhere they go, THEN it might be newsworthy.  Now, not so much.	22
1	Is this... Real? Is this an actual ghazi meet up?	22
1	"Yeah but still, GG does this kind of thing anyway so it doesnt really matter if this is fake because it might as well be real."	22
0	I get the feeling that would cause a shitstorm.	22
1	My faith in the goodness of human nature has been severely rattled this past fortnight. This kind of thing elevates it.	22
1	If it shows up, the headline will read as follows: "GamerGate involved in bomb threat in nation's capital"	22
1	&gt;They have the self reflection and sympathy capacities of a dog.  That's insensitive to dogs.	22
1	It's almost like we acted like the rational people we are!	22
1	I think Kotaku finally having to represent GGers as harrasment victims is even better than Civ V with the Brave New World Expansion pack.	22
0	And yet the majority of comments here aren't offended by what happened to Whedon but more so that Oswalt compared the Tea Party to liberals.   Those low intelligent right wingers are the same crowd as KiA. haha	22
0	Yes I'm saying slut is bad word. Ive been with GG for like over 6 months, and I swear, I didn't think I'd go down defending people being called sluts. IM legit super sad.	22
0	There has to be Milo, the rest doesnt matter, lol.	22
1	Dude, this guy is just being a dick. If bomb threats don't count as internet points, fine, maybe they shouldn't, but that's not how everyone else got treated.	22
1	&gt;  Adam Sessler   I'd rather not be represented by a crack head to be honest.	22
0	[Here's an old interview of Randi Harper where she didn't sound crazy at all.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koYYqY-Ms38)  She actually has a sensible side to her, we're just not accustomed to seeing it.  Like most people, she's complicated.  On one hand, she harasses people and spreads intellectually dishonest character assassinations.  On the other hand, she has done things like defend @Chobitcoin against unfounded accusations from her own side.  I don't think it's a strategy, I just think she's all over the place.	22
1	&gt;He is not a gamer.  A gamer doesnt call it the two thousand six hundred.  its the twenty six hundred... fail.  A British gamer might. Incidentally: Stop calling the ZX Spectrum the "Zee Ex Spectrum", Americans.	22
1	Nothing wrong with being conservative or liberal.  I consider myself as a moderate.  You don't abandon strategies that still works in favor of untested ones.  But one must remain open minded to scrutiny for bogus claims.	22
1	Sargon looks a lot more normal than I thought he'd look  no offense Sargon	22
1	Because it's existential for them. They literally are fighting for their politics to have a place in society at all. If rejected *they* end up on the "wrong side of history", something most of them are more concerned about than us. We care about results, and they care about being in the history books with praise attached.	22
0	If you can verify, you don't need to trust.	22
1	Wow. I stopped reading RPS at least 2 years ago, but that podcast clip is just out of this world. Could probably make a drinking game with the number of times Walker defensively uses "lazy" to make an argument. Contrarily I like how the other guy waits about 20 minutes to say "I think 'offensive' is a dangerous and lazy word and it can mask dangerous and lazy people" which was *so much more powerful* than repeating it over an over in a defensive accusation. The podcast seriously adds layers of context to my opinion of him.	22
1	Because the cool ones tend not to use their trans status as a bludgeon.	22
0	Outlets needn't stick to one view, yes. But it still doesn't justify borderline DoritoGate BS.	22
0	Your evidence of Pakman being attacked for being neutral is someone criticising him for (being perceived as) no longer being neutral?	22
1	of course most people condemn a bomb threat. the issue is they straight away assume it was a 3rd party doing the threats, unlike when someone against gg gets threatened and then they automatically assume it was gg. massive double standard.	22
1	A. Make a mistake, cop to it, and have it hanging over you for something like a couple weeks.  B. Make a mistake, refuse to admit it, and leave your mistake to hang over the people affected for a few months or years.  C. Make a mistake, double-down, and use the narrative around your mistake as a bludgeon against the people affected until you meet the devil that made your rotten soul in Hell.  Decisions, decisions...	22
1	I love it.   "I've made more games than you!"  "Great job, keep it up! :)"  "Fuck off."  Truly, all you need to be is nice to them.	22

0	A simple cult recruiting tactic is to swarm individuals with your viewpoint. People want to naturally fit in,  so if there is a huge vocal movement saying you're wrong, most people tend to believe it.   Edit: source so you know I'm not just on the lol sjw cult bandwagon. I was a jw for years. Part of our recruitment was to travel in pairs because it's easier to pressure your view that way	22
0	He's one of the most useful posters here, in my opinion. Tends have a nuanced view of things and at least some insider knowledge. Would understand if he wants to remain anonymous, though.	22
0	The user said:   &gt; but don't expect rational, thinking people to always agree with you.  I didn't put up anything to agree with either, just a picture. Why are you calling me out for that but not the other user for the same thing?	22
1	No. [Prepare your trucks](https://twitter.com/colepram/status/594490739901472768).	22
1	Yeah, I don't think Chu has the balls to make a bomb threat either. But the police really do need to speak to him right now.  EDIT: Actually after seeing [this](https://twitter.com/Scrumpmonkey/status/594253463036567554) maybe he was involved somehow...	22
0	You are misusing word censorship. It's the same bullshit like when certain people call everything harasment or rape. Discussion about subjects that should or shouldn't be allowed to be disscussed here is legitimate. If bronies decided they will discuss here MLP and flood this sub with that bullshit, will you also scream censorship when mods will want to remove it?? It's ridiculous, discussion about moderation of off topic subjects is legitimate and trying to frame it as censorship is just disingenuous silencing argument.	22
1	I like that his complaint wasn't even accurate. How the hell are we right-wing? Also, if I'm wrong, and we ARE right-wing, I quit, on grounds that I'm not playing the fucking licensed Duck Dynasty game.	22

1	League for Gamers is a consumer group for gamers. We have three main goals: promote positive gaming, assist new and upcoming game makers, and advocacy for gamers rights. Follow us on @League4Gamers for more.  That's our short blurb. Longer one I'm still writing up. We are all volunteers. Have front end web dev, web designer and a backend dev. We're working on the temporary landing page now, and will be building the main site over time.	22

0	Mods are trying to push /r/SocialJusticeinAction now. This is more of that then the gaming journalism ethics that they are trying to make KiA into.  You probably got downvoted by the population of KiA subscribers that agree with the Mods.	22
0	Is there really an organisation called "Against the Islamisation of America"? That is dumb as hell, do they believe that 25% of the population if Islamic or some dumb shit?  As a Brit, I'm completely immune to this kind of stuff now. Every day there appears to be a shooting in America and there isn't really the backing or political capital to push through effective gun laws from what I can see.	22
0	Sad to see, the video is PERFECT.  How do people not pay attention to the lessons our art and media teach us?  Fact is, antiGG use the altruism of people to dictate the narrative.  It's easy to sell the protection of women to good people, and far harder to convince them a man was wronged, especially when the man is accused of anything socially unacceptable.	22
1	Misogyny excusing bar hosts hate group, violence ensues.	22

0	Seriously, she couldn't have thought that being a man was that easy, considering that she actually preferred to become a woman instead.	22
0	anti-gg just shows how great they are once again. I'm getting real sick of playing nice they want to act like TERRORISTS then they need to be treated like them.  this just shows how bad anti-gg knows they have it. the gaming world and more are on our side and they are a dying breed.	22
1	This is the best way to fight shitty journalism. Flood the market with hoaxes and lies. Force journalists to fucking investigate their stories.	22
0	Nah fuck this, translators deciding it's cool just to change up the script  to make some 'inside joke' and pander to kids,  If I was on the dev team I'd be pissed off that my script had been turned into this shit.  Like yeah I get it, translating humour across different languages and cultures is hard, but at least try.	22
0	It's not unfair, if you will excuse them for what they do and only let them shit on us all the time, you will just help their narrative. They were openly trying to disrupt the meetup.	22
0	You could always contact one of the lawyers that worked pro bono with Anonymous during the Scientology Ops. They like good causes.	22

0	&gt;So then don't?  Oh no, they can't let that go. That's not how they grew up. Someone does something bad they get a timeout. Just like mommy and daddy used to do.	22
0	So you'd be cool with Stormfront joining up with GG, right?  They expressed an interest in allying with GG when it first started.  If not, please explain why you're fine with some far-right groups but not others.	22
1	Yeah, I think that's the prevailing attitude around "post/anti/old-wave feminist" circles. Not to claim that's the only factor, just the largest. There *is* misogyny out there, and it certainly steers some women away from careers billed as hostile. But changing that(which hopefully will happen) won't magically make a bunch of women who aren't interested in STEM switch majors, because they made that choice themselves. So the gap won't change much.	22

They have strong ties to the Iraq war, climate change denial, etc, and AEI was President Bush's favorite think tank, but their scholars swear they're not neocons getting paid by energy and defense companies.   Working for a neocon think tank makes you a conservative activist.	22

1	Brütal Legend was pretty cool though. So was Psychonauts and Costume Quest and Stacking were fresh concepts and fun.  Decline started after that imo: Iron Brigade was kinda shit, then a bunch of Kinect games, The Cave was shit, Broken Age is meh at best, Spacebase DF-9 got cancelled etc.	22
1	Schrier is a really mixed bag. Half of his articles are the kind of reactionary "DRAGONS CROWN IS SO SEXIST!" nonsense that we mock, but he writes a surprising number of well researched articles that are actually pretty good.

1	No, really it's not enough unless said devs are spineless and week.   Look at Running with Scissors, Warhose Studios, and Destructive Creations.  These guys all, individually and collectively, *do not give a fuck*, and for that, they are awesome.	22
0	No the Anita argument is this subject matter I don't like is bad, therefore the game is bad	22
1	It went on Early Access, which was supposed to fund the project. What turned out was that the money from customers went to reimburse the original project investors and not to the continued development of the game.   For them it's a success story of how they can release a game on Early Access and make enough money to turn profit for the investors without risking their own money or even putting the effort to finishing the game.	22
0	Oh, I missed that. What's up? Presumbaly it was not Kuchera then?	22
1	That is a great point. having money in a mutual fund that changes stocks is NOT the same as directly donating money to a patreon or a kickstarter. Pakman is full of shit at this point. All he cares about is the clicks.    Look at Kluweless' interview, so softball. No hard questions, but he fought against Sargon on the clickbait shit for like 10 minutes.	22
0	I wish you guys would realize that this person knows full well how ridiculous what they're saying is, but that every time she says something, you guys feverishly pleasure yourselves to how stupid it is - spreading the link far and wide in the process  She's making money off you. Period. For the love of god, just drop it.	22
0	the fact that you would even say that reinforces the idea of you being a fucking creepy stalker. whats wrong with you dude	22
1	Hey guys.  Boogie here.  Having been receiving death threats since a decade before gg began can you possibly expect me to feel any different?  People suck.  I have never blamed gg when this shit happens to anita so you can't posible expect me to blame anita when it happens to you.  You guys know, I hope, that I will always have your back the best I can.  That's what this was.   Sorry if you are expecting me to point fingers on this but you know even if I could, I wouldnt.	22

0	It actually feels like Gratipay was a least-bad operator who's being jumped on because they're a weak target. It would have been nice if they could have been successful. They probably dropped Hotwheels as a basic survival issue. If they had broken the rules until they became successful enough for it not to matter, then they'd be like every other major corporation.  It's a free software project making a legit effort to do something badly needed. (for a certain definition of "legit").  I have a hard time seeing them as bad guys.	22
0	But I am a bystander.  When this movement started pursuing the distraction that is SJWs and every little thing they touch instead of focusing on the problems within the gaming community and gaming journalism, I gave up and unsubbed.  The day we took the bait and started chasing perpetually offended nobodies was the day we lost, IMO.  I only popped back because I stumbled upon the article after getting bored of reading election coverage and saw Anita Sarkessian's name get dropped.  And the only reason I came here and posted the link to the BBC complaints page was because I help to fund the BBC through my TV license.	22
0	beautiful comment. Especially love this part:  &gt;Who is this "we" form you use at the end? **You're not a developer; you're a reporter.** With whose voice are you speaking here exactly? And for what purpose?  maybe part of the dissonance is some reporters' beliefs that they share the exact same experience as game devs. Which is complete BS of course. journalism =/= programming, modeling, nor designing.	22
0	aint that the truth. In fact I'd go so far as to say Redpillers are so bad I would rather spend a day locked in a room with an SJW versus a 10 minute conversation with a redpill.	22
0	How about it? A lot of people who mainly post here also post in ghazi on occasion. Have you actually read my ghazi posts? Usually it's defending GG or pointing out when ghazi is being unfair. I even got banned for a bit for wishing cancer on someone who was being an Internet tough guy about TotalBiscuit's cancer.	22
0	I know you're often contrarian and appreciate that, but the votes are there for a reason. GG is growing just fine and there's community interest in examining the root causes behind the issues we face (radical feminism, encroaching authoritarianism...)	22

0	Cool. Because he just described the Muhammed carton expo in Texas. Whoosh.	22
1	They started as former GGers who didn't like how GamerGate was going for whatever reason, so they jumped ship. When enough of them started bailing, they sort of formed a little community of "remember when GamerGate used to be good?"  Some of their antics are unintentionally hilarious though, they tried really really hard to get /cow/ to go after pro-GG people instead of SJWs, but because they all used the same sort of language and spoke in the same memes they were spotted pretty quickly. People just ended up laughing at them and their ineffectual attempts at raiding the boards.  I think they mostly stick to twitter now where it's easier to mob people.	22

0	How does it not show the same for this subreddit? *Netz gegen Nazis* has free journalists writing articles for them. It's only editorial stance is "strengthening civil society" against neo-Nazism, racism, and discrimination of minorities. You know how gamergate is about ethics and politics in gaming? Despite people linking and praising anti-feminists like AVFM who primarily have nothing to do with either? It's like that.	22

1	This is the same bullshit Josh was spewing when it happened.   Apparently you cant make fun of ISIS because in some countries people who end up as ISIS dudes are part of a minority? The fuck is this.   The best part is that ISIS goes around killing people left and right in the sections they control for not following their crazy ass rules.   Let's forget that ISIS is fucking crazy and focus on some other shit.	22
1	Isn't that basically "white feminism"? Cause I seriously look at it like rich white women complaining they're not as rich as rich white men.   (White feminism is a term Google or look it up on twitter)	22
0	I agree. I was initially shocked and then decided not to care. Far worse games exist and have a better reputation (good or bad) than this game has or will. It's not like this is the first game of its kind either. I remember a few years back a flash game came out under the exact same premise and circulated the internet for a while.	22

1	Pakman seems to be in denial about the fact that the feminist movement has massively lost its way. He clearly still considers himself a "feminist" (as many of us once did before the crazies became by far the most prominent representatives of the movement) and is heavily emotionally invested in maintaining his belief that #notallfeminists are bad. This was also really clear during the CH Sommers interview.  Also his titles are clearly clickbaity as hell holy shit...	22

1	Honestly? We don't take bomb threats very seriously.  We take the hypocrisy, narrative building and propaganda that surrounds them seriously.	22
1	Well he already apologized for his previous gamer hating arguments, but he isn't ignorant about video games, in fact it's surprising how informed he is now having not touched a game before August 2014, so much as to constantly participate in debates. He may be involved in GG more because he's right-wing and is more interested in the anti-SJW aspect, but he has defended gamers more than these people who are supposed to be gamers since they were kids	22
0	Isn't this whole chart a type of [categorization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-categorization_theory)? There's an argument to be made that calling people SJWs facilitates inter group conflict that can ocassionally lead to hatred of the other side.	22
1	I wonder if they'd give a shit if it was an actual bomb and several of us died.  ...eh, probably not.	22
1	His age is a large part of his behavior. Part of what fuels his angst is that he hasn't' achieved anything in life.   He's devoted everything to "games journalism" and while that shouldn't be a tawdry career choice, a huge amount of people have only antipathy for him.  He's also managed to not actually improve at his craft through all the years- he's not particularly funny or clever or insightful, in a world where through the internet, hundreds of clever, witty writers can be summoned in minutes.   He's awful. And deep down he knows it.	22

0	You're 100 percent right. It's hard when it hits close to home. I hope that GG, in their effort to be more accepting of woman, will tone it down.	22
0	Not quite.  One is fighting SJWs.  The other is fighting anyone who acts unethically (including SJWs).	22
1	These are the same people who tried to justify the terrorist attack against Charlie Hebdo.

0	I am not sure what your point is.  My point was that if you don't something to incite violence, then expect it.  Pamela Geller is purposely doing things that she knows will cause issues.  Regardless of the free speech implications.  If I call someone's wife a fat bitch, I expect a punch in the mouth.  Even if it is free speech.	22
1	We should really do something to help them. That would send a good message, and I think they deserve it, and that we kinda owe it to them. (We being anyone who was supportive of that meetup)	22
1	You're trying way too hard there son.	22
0	Saying he deliberately stepped in front of him is a lot different than saying the threw him on the ground. It also requires the force to come from someone other than him - the guy was either pushed by someone else, across Crowder's path, or the guy stepped briskly in front of him, for one reason or another. Also as far as I can tell, he's not even looking at him when it happens - he's looking to the right. The guy appears to blow through him, from the left, in such a way that it even turns Crowder's body.	22
0	Given that they're the two most commonly referred to articles here, yeah.	22

1	How can Packman cover Gamergate when he has not read nor researched the Zoepost which was the catalyst?	22
0	Uhh, where did you read any of that?  I can't quite find anything in the linked piece that says any of that.	22
1	Brütal Legend was good because of how heavily Jack Black contributed to it. That game is his, not Shafers.	22
0	You're questioning these people's morality, as if you know their morality. Good people can believe in bad things, good people can make mistakes and side with the wrong side of an issue. People make mistakes, and to say "Well you were a part of that tribe so we'll never trust you" is not very conducive to winning allies.  Don't be so presumptuous to think that you get to decide who is moral and who is not.  Just because they were or are anti-gamer gate doesn't mean that they're immoral.	22
1	Lets play a little game   &gt;If i had to read one more article humazing homosexuals   Sounds pretty shitty but lets keep going  &gt;If i had to read one more article humanizing black people  Well dosnt that just sound fucked up now lets find one that would enrage a legbeard  &gt;If i had to read one more article humanizing feminists  The triggering from that would be felt across continents	22

1	If I've learned anything the past 8 months, Ghazi and AntiGG has to distance themselves from their tags like #StopGamerGate2015 and any activities if they don't want to be called terrorists. They can fight muh-soggy-knees, but they aren't allowed to do it in any way that opposes GG or on the channels they have used so far, because... hate group!	22
1	Someone made a false bomb threat in the nation's ***capital***.  Who is this stupid?  EDIT: A BLOCK AWAY FROM THE **POLICE STATION**	22
0	The KYM page was about as comprehensive  (history wise) as the wiki.	22
0	The same way anyone else without an agenda does. Google superhero genre. Enjoy all the lists that don't include twilight and hunger games. Also missing are things like lost boys, interview with a vampire, American werewolf in London/paris. Because they're not superhero movies no matter how you try to twist it.	22
0	Non. Can I ask if you would call your own mother or daughter a slut? No one has actually answered this.	22
1	They're not the only ones smearing GG/8chan with this as I found [this article from Gawker](https://archive.is/JtNrB) in the [r/Baltimore subreddit](https://archive.is/s3Uxn).	22
1	What hasn't been called what on /pol/?	22
0	And you chose to completely ignore the rest of the context. Well done.   This place is more and more starting to house exactly the type of people that Ghazi is housing. Everyone is looking to get offended about something, or find an excuse to hate on someone, just on the opposite side of aGGros.	22
1	Just because people repeat this and you want it to be true doesn't make it so.	22
1	These tweets are saying that it was a bomb threat that was phoned in. Not sure on the legitimacy: -  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CD-aLyCUgAEwxLt.png	22
0	The correct path is often littered with distractions and obstacles.  Keep up the good work man.	22
1	&gt;... But there is a whole other side of individuals who for a long time have said, Gamergate really **is and should be** about sexism, misogyny in video games etc.  What the fuck is Pakman trying to say here? If he's talking about a side that considers themselves anti-GG, is he saying that anti-GG say that Gamergate **should be** about sexism and misogyny?  Or is he saying that he has seen a side that considers themselves pro-GG, and yet say that Gamergate is and should be about sexism and misogyny.  Seriously, what the fuck?	22
0	Africa is well and truly fucked by white corporate insterests though.	22
0	You're talking about the Iraq War and the last few decades and I'm telling you these word games were a done deal a century ago.  Classical liberalism, had fuck-all to do with birth control and gay issues, products of contemporary leftist politics.  The "religious right" as a concept didn't exist until the last 40 years, well after "liberal" had been twisted to mean "radical."  Your definition of liberalism is pedantically outdated and insisting the rest of us use it is absurd.	22
1	Well Ghazi has been pretty vocal that the actions of a few trolls represent our entire group. Maybe if we use their own logic and blame them they'll realise that GG is actually a group of diverse people.	22
1	They mention Anita's threats even though she has absolutely nothing to do with the story but don't mention Lizzy's threats who they contacted for the story. Yeah sounds about right.	22
0	All I'm saying is that is not what crying wolf is. You're the one flipping out. You're using the term wrong, that's it.	22
0	Fuck that racist bigoted asshole. Looking forward to his new game, because I want to see how much it will flop, since he likes to insults his consumers. He drank the cool aid and betrayed his fans.	22
0	I came here to laugh at you.	22
0	And then it would be up to KiA to decide whether or not it's worth looking into. Not a big deal. If it weren't worth reading? It would be downvoted and forgotten. If it was? It would be upvoted and discussed. That's the nature of KiA.	22
1	Also I think Tait compared Not Your Shield to the Stasi.	22
1	A more accurate statement would be:  "They have actively worked to boycott Kotaku until they correct the many issues with their website".   It's not like people have been ddosing their website... we don't give a fuck if other people read it.	22
1	I don't think this will be the last time either.	22
0	That is ridiculous paranoia, evidence is evidence, was this man baited? he was still an easily baitable nutjob, was he taken out of context? that was the longest out of context quote of all time.  The Tea party is fucking crazy, global warming denial is fucking stupid. Do not defend either.	22

1	Eh, may not have been them, could have been trolls. Either way, can't argue with free drinks. Just sucks that whoever it was disrupted a business and scared a bunch of people because they disagree with what said people were saying (or for teh lulz, either way they are psychopaths).	22

0	He has a reddit account named Loate?	22
1	&gt;Organizers of the meetup included Christina Hoff Sommers, a professor and critic of liberal feminism  She is a liberal feminist.  She is a critic of radical feminism.  I wonder if they'll have the ethics to correct that.	22
1	Your anecdote has nothing to do with the objective reality that less women are entering stem fields - by their own decisions.	22
0	That doesn't matter though. The word is most often used to mean that if a girl sleeps with more guys that is "acceptable" then she's not good. If you truly want equality then no girl should be judged by how many guys she sleeps with.	22
0	So every game with violence and a lone protagonist is automatically not serious? That's kind of a weak argument there.	22
0	His comment was a joke, albeit a distasteful one. Derek's comments were eye-opening, and last I heard he was looking to bring some GG supporters into our meetups to share their side of things. We've all said things online that make us look like assholes, but he's a good guy.	22
1	No, they felt betrayed because you took their money and didn't finish the game(s) you promised.   They think you're an assclown because somehow mocking women and minorities with sockpuppets makes you a feminist.	22
1	Men cant be raped though /s	22
0	Nonetheless an idiotic statement. It's essentially an "I know you are but what am I?" And what's worse, it's utterly wrong.	22
0	The community is much bigger and more diverse than mid-2000s 4chan. We even have a handful of girls this time, believe it or not. A meaningful comparison is impossible.	22

0	&gt;To turn the question around. Why do you have a problem with them being gamers and as gamers being active in GamerGate?  Are they?  Because you said...  &gt;And /pol/ doesn't care all that much about vidya to put it nicely.  By your own admission, these people aren't gamers and don't care about video games.  Which is it?	22
1	this is why I'm convinced we're near a social media bubble burst. corporations, most of the media, celebrities, and everyone else right now are convinced that twitter and the rest of social media are the voice and the will of the people - when in reality it's the shrill screaming voice of an extreme minority.  it's only a matter of time until they get figured out.	22
1	He does know that they can just meet up literally anywhere else in DC... Like a national monument.   Hell, they can meet up at the White House and go on tour or meet up from there. This guy clearly doesn't know how to lodge a conplaint. Even worse, he doesn't even know the turn out for the last GG meet up. Just send them pictures from the last one (the one of the full store with people buying stuff should help) and Arthur will find his complaints fall on deaf ears soon enough.	22

Here's a highly upvoted thread where 2 Hispanic women, one of whom is trans and a black guy are called White/Non-minorites just because they don't support #NotYourShield.  https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2suai7/5_white_people_upset_that_they_dont_get_to_speak/  And when someone points it out a bunch of people are ratio0nalizing it with "But Zimmerman was called White.."	22
0	The differences between "elites must decide what kinds of games you may play" and "elites must decide what kinds of cars you may drive" and "elites must decide how your child may be educated" and "elites must decide how much money you may have" are really just different faces of the same instinct that you need to be controlled by your betters. I don't know a brand of leftism that doesn't subscribe to one of those notions.	22
0	Thank you for picking up on that spelling error, I must have missed it.   I'd make the case that all feminism is liberal at core, but I'd argue that "equality" feminism is now more conservative, compared to the radical feminism which has become the liberal norm. The thing with political thought is that once an idea becomes mainstream, it becomes a conservative idea.	22
0	long hashtag that I just don't see pulling eyeballs even if trending.  It'd pull in more feminists than anything else.  Might even get hijacked	22
0	Didn't some false rape thing happen for a similarly stupid reason in the UK?  A girl claimed she was raped to get out of seeing her boyfriend for some silly reason.  Can't remember the story offhand but it seriously fucked up the guy's life.	22
0	Your friends have never made anything worthwhile, and are as ugly on the inside as the outside. Luckily, you fit right in :\^)	22
0	Thats just plain silly.	22
0	I don't vote because I believe it lends credibility to the current system's illusion of a public voice.  Brand deconstruction of the ones that seek to, already have, or currently profit from the government is the best course of action for real change.  edit: Well I guess the real reason I don't vote is because I think both parties are batshit insane.	22
0	I see nothing morally wrong with criticizing, mocking and shaming people for their sexual perversions either. Especially when they voluntarily put it out there. It's not "private" when you post it online.	22
0	You mean like [The Groundswell Group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundswell_group), which included GG's own Breitbart?	22
1	Can't allow any opportunity that shows that GamerGate might contain reasonable people.	22
0	I don't see anything about Social Justice, anything to do with feminism, etc... in the comic.	22
1	Well if someone was true to the term yes, but the political connotation of liberal/conservative has more or less become synonymous with left/right over the last few decades.	22
0	Most anti-Nazis are batshit insane leftists, they are in many ways like SJWs and in some ways a lot worse, for instance a lot of them are actually extremely violent in real life. I guess you have to be batshit insane to take neo-Nazis seriously.	22

0	I've seen his videos. On the one hand he can come off as someone who just wants to take the piss out of people. On the other hand, some of his more serious discussions are insightful, such as when he talks about campus politics. I think if we can get him to sit down and have a serious discussion with someone who's well informed on the issue, it would turn out well.	22
0	No, if we were doing that, this discussion wouldn't be happening, period.  In this fictitious reality you have created where all mods are evil just waiting for a chance to fuck users over, and ban dissenting opinion, you seem to think *your* opinion is the only one that matters.  Take the tin foil hat off your head, go outside and get some natural light. Maybe you'll come to understand that this post was asking users what direction *they* want to go in after *they* gave been complaining for awhile about these types of posts	22

0	"no it doesn't" why? according to the common definition of the word, it does. satire has historically been used to expose the shortcomings of the powerful and/or as a criticism of social injustices, dating back to at least Ancient Greece. in the Roman Empire/Republic (at times very totalitarian in nature), satire was the only effective method of criticism available to the common people. if you'd like to familiarise yourself with what satire is, you may want to check out a modern day example such as The Daily Show or similar.	22

0	Oh man, moon court is THE WORST... :(	22
0	&gt;Adding more post tags, such as the proposed [Censorship] tag.  I'm actually with this.  This will keep the off-topic tag from looking too "generic".  The other thing I can think of is cross-linking to SJInAction when someone makes a post here, to encourage people to start posting over there.  The problem is if you make spinoff boards, most of us don't migrate there because KiA is just too convenient of a place to talk about all kinds of stuff.  It's kind of a toughie, unfortunately.	22

0	If we do anything, we should announce a campaign of some sorts to change Gamergate's name to something else that is has a much larger scope. Incorporating all of those involved in Gamergate to participate in things outside of gaming.  Gamergate has largely moved beyond gaming anyway. We still cover gaming stuff and it's usually our top priority, but we're also interested in other nerd culture and the random bullshit our opponents put other people through (Shirtgate, Vitamin World, etc).	22

1	When did younger people become such pearl-clutching fainting couches? (Answer: when their academic discipline required it in order to publish.)  This kind of "feeling based" research belongs in the dustbin of history with phrenology and humourism (Hippocratic medicine).  I have the feeling they would be surprised to learn that gamers have bowel movements, burp, and often (*gasp*) pass wind. I can almost hear their response in a heavy southern drawl as they fan themselves: *Oh mah dear. Ah think ah'm a feelin' faint jus a thinkin' bout it.*	22

0	Hello off-topic and irrelevant, nice to meet you!	22
1	&gt; Wouldn't the bomb threat be the work of trolls?   An anonymous tweet is entirely representative of the group that the tweeter claims to represent. It's simply not possible that a troll could falsely claim to belong to a group. Also using "guilt by association" all members of the twitter tag are responsible for the actions of a single individual. So now anybody who ever claimed to be anti-GG is responsible for these death threats and therefore feminism is a hate group. That's just logic.   /s	22
1	Admittedly KIA is now 80% about the shit that SJWs are pulling. Not that I have a problem with that.	22
1	Also note how he didn't attribute the bomb threat to anyone except a "deleted Twitter account."  Not "anti-GG" or "someone opposed to GG" or even "a human being."  Meanwhile Kotaku will attribute literally everything to Gamergate even when Gamergate has absolutely nothing to do with the topic by any stretch of the imagination.  IIRC they were gamedropping GG in every Ellen Pao article.	22
1	from the description:   &gt; PolarBear21 mentioned an example I missed: "I would add that the Men's Rights Conference that was held this summer had a bomb threat and end result is the conference had to change hotels. This is a tactic SJWs and feminists do to anyone who disagrees with them."  the pattern is:   - SJWs get pissed off about something a person/ organization does   - SJWs start false accusation campaign (racist, sexist, fat shaming...) to intimidate the person/ organization    - Person/ Campaign tells them to get lost and doesn't cave   - Violent threats happen (bomb threat etc.)	22
1	It seems like he really believes it too. Poor bastard's living in a nightmare.	22
0	Why the heck is there need to deliberately offend an offendatron? They're already automatically offended.  It's like pissing in an ocean of urine. Great achievement!	22
0	&gt;The only reason you seem to be making any connection between the two is the last paragraph.  You mean the paragraph where defenders of Groundswell compare it to Journolist?  If there's any significant difference between the two, it's that Journolist disallowed members of government.	22
0	Nice game industry post there.	22
0	&gt; glorifies the killing of homosexuals   This game no more glorifies the killing of homosexuals than every other action game glorifies the killing of heterosexuals.  It's a fucking game.  &gt; Who the fuck reviewed this?  Try running a search on your favorite search engine or Twitter. SJW game journalists are condemning it all over the place.	22

0	Sorry, but 8chan is actually disgusting. Legit child porn and other stuff on there, and no good way to report it other. I really find it difficult to care about this dude, and I think it's good he is being cut off. Edit: htanks for the points you all made lots and lots to think about.	22
1	No seriously. That can't be real right? Holy shit. It's too perfect.	22
1	Couldn't have imagined such a big turn out. Even the approximate number, 300, is strangely auspicious considering the monstrosity that we are fighting.	22

So many people have trouble seeing that, so either I'm doing my job too well, or really shitty.  In terms of this discussion, I know GG inside and out, have been here since the beginning, and can offer a different (media based) perspective than a few others can. If 3-5 people are going, having varied perspectives will help in discussing the topic at hand.	22
0	No, people understand that today's feminism is third-wave and overwhelmingly want to have nothing to do with it. Anyone who's still with it knows they're part of a hate movement. The equivocation argument is disingenuous.	22
0	Plenty to work with.	22
0	This is going to be contentious but I'll say it anyway.  I actually can't think of many legitimate (outside of shitposting for lols) reason to send a message to someone with the word rape (at least publicly, is it still filtered in DMs?).  Feminist discussion on rape appears to be the most legitimate reason to use the word...  tl;dr: it's a bigger loss for feminists than GG.	22

0	People sit at their computers, typing the opposite, in a country founded on people who considered it a legitimate strategy. And are only allowed to speak their minds with that kind of freedom because their ancestors disagreed with them.  They have a right to be stupid, but they should be a little more aware.	22
0	are you not aware that aayteam is responsible for most of the harassment/threats sent out in gamegates name? are you not aware that they have twice now tried to undermine our websites?   They're actively trying to sabotage us. Some of them are anti-GG pretending to do it for lulz.   If you don't understand why it might be smart to be skeptical of people who interact with them, then i don't know what i can do for you.	22
1	Because the MRM has gone through a lot of the same bullshit that GG has. Who cares if someone brings it up? Some of our biggest allies are proponents for the MRM: Christina Hoff Sommers, Milo, the Honey Badger Brigade, etc.	22

I was loosing faith in KiA but this thread does a lot to keep my spirits up.	22
1	Reported to twitter for targeted harassment.  Nothing will happen of course but meh keep showing Twitter are hypocrites to actual harassers.

1	&gt;They'll complain about censorship and ethics when they're on the wrong side of it.  \&gt;Implying there is a right side to it.  Seriously, censorship is not okay for any reason. Saying that there is a right or wrong side of it is silly.	22
0	One which is based on a reading of the entire constitution, not just the first ten amendments.	22
0	No, not really. I haven't been to AgainstGamerGate in a long long time (and that's in spite of not really identifying as proGG). I do question how a sub can go from something like that to being a neutral zone. It seems like a troubled starting point to work from.	22
1	No. Go back a read it, its funny that anyone could take it serious .	22
1	It's just showing where we get media coverage.	22
1	Interesting, as I was permabanned from RPS in 2012 for criticizing Feminist Frequency and RPS's incessant, fawning, uncritical advertising for them.  Prior to that I'd been a subscriber to RPS, which carried no benefits but supporting the site. Alec Meer was who banned me, and I reached out to John Walker, who I greatly admired at the time, for a more levelheaded response.  Help did not come.  After that incident I quickly became aware Walker has a Messiah complex, and wields smugness like a club. RPS, like most gaming bloggers, *despise* all readers who do not worship them as gods.	22
0	I can't help but think AntiGG is being run by the government. It fits all the criteria. Keep the people fat and poor, make them feel that fat is the only thing being ok. You may think I'm crazy but I see all the links there. It's even a little blatant.	22
1	Is it me or he should be too old for that sort of behaviour?	22
0	It was more about the kind of people who lose their jobs over spouting hate speech on the internet. A group you seemed to think I should be concerned for.   I don't know what it means you took it as directed at you rather than the people you were crying for, but at best it probably means you should stop being so sensitive. And that sensitivity is especially ironic coming from someone whose opening conversational gambit was to attempt to discredit me by branding me as a rich american.	22

1	I'm just waiting for them to actually make good on their threats some time.   They're getting more radical and radical, plenty of them aren't mentally sound to start with, it's bound to happen some time.	22
1	Also seems many are actually saying its most likely a troll in this very thread but Arthur Chu's tweets throw a bit of doubt on troll vs not troll which was a factor that wasn't in play in Anita's case.	22

And feminist themes being discussed critically within them was handled pretty reasonably when the criticism about the medium evolved to a point where that could be discussed. Good lord, if there **one** thing that characterizes basically **everyone** who calls themself a Gator, it's this - a complete lack of understanding in any medium *besides* videogames.   God.

1	You know, I do believe that people with exceptional wealth should give more in charitable donations. Heck, I make under $20k/year and I still donate to food kitchens and homeless shelters whenever I can. But I believe those donations should be done to charity, and asking for direct PayPal donations to *yourself* makes you an *astronomical dick.*	22
1	Wait. I've never commented there (nor do I have an account) so I'm not familiar with the way it works.  Are you saying that an actual human being who works for (or volunteers for) Kotaku has individually and selectively *approved* those comments? That the section is moderated and yet they STILL allowed pro-death-threat sentiment?	22
0	Yes, I also respect his attempt to be fair to us, despite hating our guts.	22
0	scrolling through the various definitions (and especially the wiki article) i feel that it does imply "punching up" but if you choose to interpret it in a different way that's fine with me.	22
1	Exactly what happened. Green confided in someone he trusted that he was intentionally baiting them, to keep them focused on Cabal. That guy turned out to be a troll himself, and leaked it (then complained that people were spamming the tag because self awareness is not his strong suit). Some people are blaming Green for that and it kind of baffles me.	22

1	This is the petty shit people like Arthur Chu do in attempt to feel like they've actually won at something,  even if they did decide to stop the meet up at that location they could just meet up out side and go somewhere else.  Does GG go around and try to get Chu banned from doing his stupid panels at conventions?  No, because were not afraid of what he has to say,  his lies can easily be debunked however they're certainly afraid of what GG has to say and that's why they constantly try to censor us or get us banned.	22

The fact they can easily be falsified is just that, a **fact**, looking at it in any other way is just blatant willful ignorance.  You say I'm a 'tin foil hatter', however we know for a **fact** that Ghazi, and 3rd party trolls commonly stalk the threads to fuck with us/false flag/cherrypick.

0	except 4chan has done this in the past and various other chan boards by pulling fake stunts. the precedent has been set a long time ago before, wouldn't be surprised if it was pulled again  I wonder why anti-GG was immediately blamed the second it occured? it was planned, it's a common chan tactic unless you've been on the internet for only a year.  chans often attack themselves to prove their point by shifting it to their opposition as the cause.	22
1	They'll never admit it because in their minds it's not harassment, it's "justice."	22

0	Can you point out what you thought suggests "banhammering" or "blacklisting"?	22
1	Yes, it was just purely coincidence. It's not like our biggest opponent reads our posts so they'd know exactly where and when we'd have meetups. That's crazy talk, you should get a job and stop being such a crazy glue sniffer!	22
1	I have no words. While I did expect this to pop up from a media outlet, I'm not at all surprised that the big self-important antiGGers took part in beginning this narrative.   Also, it physically hurts my head whenever I read a string of comments from Ghazi. I'm amazed how logic-impaired these people are.	22
0	&gt; No.  So GG's ideal world is one where you can write these things without fear?  Because GG's actions seem to contradict that.  &gt; without being megaphoned and silenced  Eh?  &gt;  or giving commentaries of games that don't tow the "party line."  I don't know what you're getting at here.  &gt; And not be afraid of making or enjoying games deemed "problematic," toxic, etc  So you want a world where people can't label games?  WTF?	22
1	The dude literally said it's a computer science major with an emphasis on graphics programming. Just because he takes a class about programming graphics and working with DirectX or OpenGL instead of operating system design or something similarly unneeded for video games doesn't make his computer science less computer science-ey. Graphics programming is fucking hard.	22

0	With all due respect, it's irrelevant what your experience with a certain phrase is.   I mean, do we suddenly change the meaning of entitlement and what not because sjw's keep using it incorrectly?  Ironically what you're doing is the same thing you're criticizing. By claiming that said term is solely used incorrectly, you're implying that there's no case in which Islamophobia really exist which means you're dismissing real people who really suffer from others acting out of Islamophobia. Just because your specific experience is that the term is used incorrectly.	22
0	Oh, I think you're right about that. I misunderstood.  That just screams 'incorrect forum' if we have to use our powers to cut through a huge non-GG circlejerk. It's a huge argument *in favor* of separating that to its own thing.	22

0	Pretty sure it'd be legal here.  The game isn't pushing people to go out and do the action for xyz reasons. Therefor it doesn't fall under the "inciting violence against identifiable groups."   Incitement is the key word in all of this, if I create a game called "murder all the gays" and in the game I tell them that they get bonus points for "killing all the gays" that would be incitement.  If I make a game that's called "murder all the gays" but nothing else, I'm not inciting anyone.	22

0	Mebbe, you've just encapsulated pretty much how I feel about gamergate much more eloquently than I could after many, many attempts.  And thank you for calling out the "SJWs caused the corruption in games journalism!" Narrative that I've started to see crop up recently.	22
0	&gt; one needn't imagine the kind of world ideologues and SJWs like to see, let alone write a tale about it. For in a sense, it's already here.  Oh no, what a dystopian hellscape we live in!  Games like GTA and Bayonetta have been suppressed to the point of being freely available!	22

Like, it felt like for everyone else, it was just business as usual. I mean, Natasha to a degree got some characterization, but that mostly stemmed from us learning about her backstory which is still pretty muddy.  I mean, I liked Age of Ultron, but I felt like it was a big setup for Civil War, Ragnarök, and Infinity War (with a bit of Black Panther for good measure).	22
0	I've voiced this idea before, and it definitely has its own problems, but I thought I'd bring it up while you guys are asking:  What about creating another subreddit either called "gamergate minus" just for threads about ethics in games or "gamergate plus" for all the culture war threads?  Again, I can see a lot of problems with splitting the subreddit, so consider it a shower thought.	22
1	Let's not start the fear mongering	22
0	It will always be relevant. Just because "Liberal" has been twisted in the last couple decades doesn't mean we should continue to use the word incorrectly.	22

1	We were fine hell Milo lead the charge to go find another bar lol	22
1	I think a lot of what we're seeing could be the SJW's understanding that they've failed to capture the gaming subculture and taking up scorched earth tactics as a last resort.  Atheism told them to fuck off and successfully fended off their influence. They shot back by smearing the fuck out of them and flushing their reputation down the shitter with fedora/neckbeard/MRA memes. If they weren't going to have atheism, they were going to make sure it wasn't a ground worth having. It's possible that they're now doing everything they can to make a similar example out of us.	22
0	That hit me right in the feels.	22
0	My point was not so much that he *wasn't* doing a shitty thing. Because he was doing a massively shitty thing for what seems like very petty reasons (like, honestly, if there was a aGG meetup I would not give a damn unless they were colluding to do something).  My point is, what he is doing, doesn't qualify as harassment. I took it to mean that what he was doing to the restaurant by bothering them about a "hate group".	22

I agree with Sargon that the main battles of ethics in games journalism has won but the important part is people eyes are open and GamerGate can function as a watchdog for groups trying to shoehorn their politics (ex: conventions kicking people based on disagreeing with someone politically) and/or personal friends (ex: journalists promoting friends and not disclosing) in the industry unethically.	22

We are going for the mainstream twitter audience, we need something memorable, with great posts that will make people say "wow those people are crazy &amp; liars" it works.  We can't be on the defensive all the time or worrying about fee fees in whats effectively a meme war.  They don't give a shit about ours.	22

0	It's not about reaching out to women who want to "close the gender gap" because people without a genuine interest in STEM won't invest themselves in the field obviously.  It's about reaching out to women and *girls* who are legitimately interested in STEM, but may not have previously seen a STEM career as something *they could do*.  The people to target are women who may have not considered this career path due to their own misconceptions of the field or perceptions of their role in society.	22

0	Yeah, that's not even *close* to being a credible source. Besides the fact that it's a hugely small amount of people, it's also **insanely easy** to falsify the results. Strawpoll is about as flawed as you can get when it comes to gathering the actual gross opinions of any group.	22
0	Your definition of "great" is highly suspect or, more likely, you've never seen anything truly "great".  Compare Buffy with The Twilight Zone. That would be a comparison to something "great".   The word "great" is a word of conquest. Hence "Alexander the Great". You can't just call something "great". What is it "Greater Than"?	22
1	Equal pay for unequal work!	22
0	i think it's relevant. fat acceptance goes largely undiscussed but it's really a root issue that gamergate should be aware of. if it seems weird to you that people complain about sexy women in video games, you should understand that it's because fat women have collectively decided (through an array of fat acceptance social networks) that all women need to look like shit to lower mens' standards.	22
0	No. This isn't a chan.	22
0	True, but "false" does imply that the person admitted or was caught lying. For all we know the accuser withdrew the accusation because they got an undisclosed settlement or was threatened with violence (stranger things have happened). So, baseless, unsubstantiated, unproven, maybe?	22
1	Yay, yet another person I get to loose respect for.  Seriously: http://i.imgur.com/NMS5JMd.png  It's 2015, stop making excuses for people's inability to use Google. I don't care how beloved they are.	22
1	Aaaaaand we have a bomb threat folks..  https://archive.is/PhaQd	22
1	It's kinda like the old Comics Code Authority. Encourage an atmosphere of self censorship and threaten those who dare risk the industry for the good of the children/women/society/progress/mankind.  It's a convenient way of dodging accusations of censorship, allowing them to falsely claim that devs/creators as simply exercising their artistic rights even when censorship and moral panic are evident.	22
1	Even as an Apple fan, I refuse to use the trackpad when gaming because they just don't work for most games I play. I will say that the trackpad is more responsive than other trackpads I've used (to be fair, mostly cheaper Dell laptops), but it doesn't work for a lot of games. Even their Magic Mouse, with the touch gesture functionality, doesn't work for FPSes, because you can't left and right click at the same time, and you can't middle click at all. I just use an old Microsoft mouse for most games (looking into getting a "proper" gaming mouse at some point).	22
1	You really think someone would do that? Just go on the Internet and tell lies?	22
0	BLACKS AND ASIANS AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE	22
0	No, a conflict of interest = have an interest which COULD bias you.    Conflicts of interest can be actual, potential, or apparent.  An apparent conflict of interest is when there is not actually a conflict, but to a reasonable 3rd party it could appear that there is a conflict.  Those still have to be disclosed!   I've spent a significant amount of time managing conflicts of interest in a professional setting.	22
1	Thanks man, I appreciate that.	22
1	No, that doesn't even begin to describe this article. The "news" piece contradicts itself in the same fucking paragraph. First it says that "Local 16" Sommers was a bar patron, then it implies she is the bar owner. This guy couldn't even keep his narrative straight for a paragraph. I could understand if the author just copy pasted the article from Kotaku, but apparently they couldn't even do that correctly.	22
0	Look, I oppose this authoritarian uber-left as much as anyone else here, but if you asked me what Protein World's advertising campaign had to do with breaches of ethics, gaming, or even crappy journalism in general, the answer is still the same: nothing.	22
0	They're not wrong though. The white man had many a manifest destiny and "tamed" the lands. A few world wars later we might have chilled a bit, but for a time, white was always right.	22
1	Fuck that. He deserve to have his nose rubbed in his own hypocritical shit.	22
1	Yep. The culture war is going to be one tough fight given how politically correct mobs seem to get their way so often.  You did great in the interview, btw.	22
0	Do you know what "Islamisation" means? A tiny fraction of the American population is Muslim and even smaller fraction want to Islamise the US. There are tons of shootings in the US every month, a fella shoot some Muslims a few weeks ago.	22
0	GMG pretty much deals exclusively in stolen keys these days, I dunno why anyone would be remotely surprised.	22
0	Even with the most generous description of GG'S origins, I can't fathom a narrative where she injected herself into GG rather than the opposite.	22
1	Before I knew who she was I had a youtube video with a clip of her in it playing in the background and I honestly thought it was a guy speaking until I went back and started watching the video. Then I **knew** it was a guy.	22
1	Is it really that surprising? We condemn harassment done towards antis. As wrong as the usual crowd of SJWs and LWs are, I certainly wouldn't want anyone to get swatted or harassed or killed.  The struggle begins with the definition of harassment. Antis call criticism and disagreement harassment and we would disagree. But everyone here knows what actual harassment is and I'll hope none of us actually want it to happen anywhere.	22
1	&gt; Participants in GamerGate frequently use social media to annoy and harass various targets (including many of us here at Kotaku).  Gotta stick the unsourced 'muh harassment' narrative there somewhere I guess, I wonder if they alerted the authorities on the harassment that the Kotaku staff suffered, I mean they should really, it's not like they made it up so they can keep the sensationalist clickbait bile flowing from Gawker's festering pores.	22
0	Video description, but yeah, mostly comments.	22
0	So.. does deepfreeze also track journalists/websites that are pro gg?	22

1	One time on Manboobz, Futrelle said Made to Penetrate shouldn't count at rape. After several days of everyone, yelling at him, he admitted he was wrong. But he said that MRAs - even though they were making the same criticisms as his readers - were just doing it to have a "gotcha".	22
1	They're definitely being trolled there is no fucking way this really exists,  lies I don't believe it.   OMG THE STUPIDITY OF THEM WRITING THIS.   WHO the fuck is juice? Is this life?  *I think I broke*	22
1	&gt;*“I wish it need not have happened in my time,"* said Frodo.    &gt;*"So do I,"* said Gandalf, *"and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.”*  Moderates are always among the least liked in a conflict, but their existance and work is no less important. Thanks for setting a good precedent with the in-progress policy for your channel that you posted a while ago. :)	22
1	And to be completely honest, anyone can get fit. If you're a guy or girl and you're a little (or a lot) out of shape, you can get fit and you deserve to because you're a strong, rationale human being. All it takes is in the kitchen (and maybe a little cardio and gym here or there). It feels great to be the rare person in the grocery store filling my cart with pure nutrition rather than junk.	22
0	Please starve this troll of your attentions. He is irrelevant to GG in every way.	22
0	when people said chu called in the threat , did you call it out for its factual shortcomings.. jeez people are too wound up.     edit: so i guess saying "Harassment and bomb threats imo from loony feminist wackos" would be ok ?  somethings that are said are implicitly opinions.  conversations(style) don't often explicitly differentiate  opinions and statements.	22
0	&gt; That's the problem, it's not an "opinion"--the wage gap has even be debunked by feminists. It's literally a myth that is just being supported through political pundancy, star power and journalists. (Hence the relevancy).    The problem is that people think this has something to do with Gamergate, which it does not I quote what it says on the right:   &gt; KotakuInAction is the place to discuss the gaming community, gaming journalism, and issues in the gaming industry.

1	Oh no, I'm in at least one of those! SHIT I'M GONNA GET DOXXED!  /s  It was a good time! Lots of fun bouncing around talking to all manner of shitlord misogynists, internalized and otherwise. This should happen again.   I was impressed with the distances people traveled, some folks came from NY, Philadelphia, Georgia, Florida, all over the place! Just goes to show, you can't stop the signal. :)	22
1	lol. just lol.  How sad their lives are.	22
1	also considering that Baltimore is only thirty some miles away.	22
0	If it was intended as a jab at the over use of Harassment, then I'll edit my posts as such, it's late here and I got up early besides but that's not how I've seen people treat it.  And yes, I'd largely make that distinction along the same lines as well, with the addendum that it requires that the communication be unwanted and continues after being said so (that, AFAIR is inline with the laws).	22
0	How hard can it be to show a little bit of appreciation for people's hard work? Seriously. Anti-GG drools all over people who are professional victims and who don't do **anything**, and all we do is call the people who run and pay our sites for us "Drysperg".	22
0	What about that slut?  Edit: Tough crowd tonight. Not like the character being called a slut is a thing.....	22
1	I can just see the spittle flying from his lips.  I also like how feMRAs need to be mentioned separately, like they're not "real" MRAs, instead of just being a subgroup.	22
1	Yep Devi Ever. Let's remind the entire string of names this weirdo has had.   Why would anybody give that person money. Blew the money it raised on Kickstarter, resulting in a large debt. Earns a little money, instead of starting paying people back gives it FemFreq while she also a owner of a tumbler with an entire dox on Anita and Anita's mother.	22
1	Well, I doubt it was Chu or any prominent aGG who did it personally. But you do have Chu inciting harassment (in dot tweets so all his followers would see) against the venue just a few hours before the bomb threat was made, so it's not like they can completely dodge responsibility either.  The difference with the bogus shooting threat against Sarkeesian is that nobody in GG was aware of that event or cared about it or was actively trying to stop it.	22
0	Nah, it's a website, but like half the terms in the filter are SJW tumblr bullshit, not trying to actually stop stormfront spam.	22
1	I heard it wuz da bomb.	22
1	&gt;For someone to come up with "My username is a combination of X and Y because for some time I had an interest in Z." out of the blue when it was on my Wikipedia user page for 8 years   DragonWyvern things he's got a monopoly on usernames that are combinations of two words based on a particular interest.

Given how often Kotaku has been caught writing stories without properly crediting =p  But hey, I'm not going to be petty and hold it against them if they try to improve, all the best to them.	22

0	If you think I"m anti-MRA you're completely mistaken and completely mischaracterizing my argument.  I'm anti GamerGate becoming about MRA - but I think MRAs have valid points just like feminists do - family court/custody battles being one of them. This just isn't the place for it.  Come back when you've got a real argument.	22
1	If you're posting anti-GG comments, you're a member of anti-GG. That's basically the definition of the group.	22
1	only difference:  they lie, we tell the truth (with proof). So lying is ok now Gmandam? The problem is not the methods, but that they lie.	22
0	&gt; now a lot of "us" do.  No, we didn't. We didn't cry wolf. THEY DID. They called in the bomb threat. That's them crying wolf.  &gt; That's the same kind of mental shitmnastics SJW do  And they're the ones doing it here. Not us.	22
0	That's what the SJWs want you to think, truth is...  money talks, just make financially successful movies and you will keep making them	22
1	Who even is Arthur Chu? I keep on seeing his name pop up but why is he relevant?	22
0	So cheating? By any normal definition of sexual abuse, you're using the term inaccurately. What you describe can in no way be considered sexual abuse and you honestly can't be surprised when a heavily moderated forum will sanction you for such misrepresentation.   Why not just call it cheating? Sexual abuse is a crime and you're accussing someone of committing that crime wrongfully.	22
1	My favorite part of this interview is that Sargon is way too smart to take the bait.	22
1	Yes, because the implication is that the goal of people in GG is to annoy/harass other people. Trying to talk to someone is not trying to annoy them. That would be a malicious activity.  Nobody really cares if Schreier is annoyed or offended by anything. There is no malice and he and everyone else who constantly touts this "GG is a hate group that constantly harasses people" line have yet to produce any evidence of it.	22
1	Actually, there exist f(x) and g(x) such that f-&gt;0 and g-&gt;infinity as x-&gt;0, and lim x-&gt;0 f(x) g(x) = C for any value C (including infinity). You can't really use two example functions to attempt to define what 0*infinity would be.	22
1	Seriously fuck SJWs, because of them we can't have nice things.	22
1	That DOES sound...... worrisome.....	22
0	I believe you and I believe that TheHat2 wants what's best too. The problem is in the very nature of moderation and free speech. *Any* attempt at censorship, even if it's in good faith, will eventually lead to the downfall of this community.	22

1	I like that this is suppose to be a "gotcha" of us. The fact that we like MI and it has Elain in it should show that the cishetwhitedudebros don't recoil from strongindependetwomynwhodon'tneednoman like vampires from sunlight.	22
0	That there's no place for men to imply that average superior physical performance due to physiological differences in any way correlates to ones ability to do a scientific study?  That women are somehow incapable of completing a study based on empirical research rather than ideologically driven agendas and are in need of men to work with them if they want to do good work?  Those sure are some awful thoughts!	22
1	SJWs have no power outside their clique. Also based bar owner.	22
1	On the contrary, I think we have accomplished all that can be accomplished with an online-only revolt.  I think this now NEEDS to become a physical presence if it's to go any further. Part of the reason this situation got so bad in the first place is because we spent years with our heads in the sand, tolerating the increasingly shitty journalism, the icreasingly agenda-driven articles, the creeping political correctness being enforced at conventions. We ignored the infection for too long.  If we get conventions, that means game devs turning up to show off their stuff to -us-. That'd be a *huge* fuck you to the vg journo establishment.	22
1	And considering Uwe Boll did the Postal movie (which was pretty good considering what it was trying to be), that link goes pretty far.	22

0	&gt; Anybody want to do a fundraiser for Eron?  Not particularly.  This is a situation where the community needs to cut its loses.  I've donated quite a bit to the HBB fund but I won't drop a penny on Eron because he is not going to win.	22
0	So there is, according to you, no statistic for how often rape accusations are deliberate lies? Or do you just not like the implication that the accuser is telling the truth more often than not?	22
0	But how exactly is posting non-gaming related SJW nonsense "addressing the root of the problem"? What operations designed to confront or mitigate non-gaming SJW nonsense have ever been organized and executed by GG in KiA?  Also, why do you think that if a story of SJW nonsense that has nothing to do with gaming *isn't* shared in KiA that it somehow results in us being blindfolded? KiA is not the only place to learn about "the root of the problem", it's not even the biggest.   Edit: I've never seen a popular off topic post in KiA NOT make bigger waves in TiA.	22
0	&lt;citation needed&gt; for some of that.  I also really don't care, take that shit to the appropriate places. We aren't fighting for "Men's Rights" here, but for a better gaming industry and against media bias. It's getting really annoying to see all these hijacking attempts by ideologues from the opposite end of the spectrum.	22
0	Hate to be that guy, but you can't expect people to have any attitude or mindset. People are who people are. But since this has been such a bumpy ride for you, I'm sure you're happy to see it moving along without you.   I appreciate what you've done in hosting the work of so many of us, but now the buck is passing, and you can focus on your other projects like Vidya.fm (really dig it btw, always down for some vidya tunes).	22
1	Sorry, that game looks like it's too fun. We're in urgent need of games that aren't fun.	22
0	&gt; Same reason we don't negotiate with terrorists, although you wouldn't know it from how our media shrinks away from depictions of Mohammed.  You do realize that the FBI negotiated with terrorists with the hostage situation that turned into a bad drone strike last week as well as the recent situation with two lone wolves that died going after Pam Grear (whatever her name) who paid $10,000 to paint Mohammed and bait Muslims, right?	22
1	The true irony of the situation is that group is so much more diverse than any of the recent photos of say GDC or any other convention.   And on the plus side the only person with crazy dyed hair was Milo, at least it wasn't pink.	22
0	You are? Where's work on your game? Have you released a game?  Curious because your post just comes off as some sort of self-pity that you can't even manage to make a game.	22
1	Timing is so critical to humor working, and they obviously don't understand that (or just don't care). You don't bury the obvious stuff a dozen tweets down. You need to start with it, establishing that it's most likely a parody from the beginning. You especially don't throw out "fuck you" and "cunt" without that context.	22
0	Oh shit! That is hilarious. God Speed Hotwheels!	22
0	Afraid of what?  Is GG's end goal a world where people are too scared to write "gamers don't have to be your audience", or to give feminist criticism of games?	22
1	Actually, I don't think he even applies for *Factorio* early access.	22
1	/u/buck_fiddle is a troll account used by a /r/gamerghazi member. do not reply or give it attention.	22
1	This is starting to become a right to assemble issue...	22
0	Yeah, because it's not like green is a "gang color" in San Jose or anything...  Sheesh.	22
0	Agreed. Too much off-topic and TiA shit keeps popping up here. I love TiA, as do probably many here, but that doesn't mean we should turn into TiA ourselves. Maybe mods can link TiA in the sidebar? But then again, KiAChatroom is linked yet people still post off-topic shit in here. Maybe mods should just come down harder on off-topic posts.	22
1	It doesn't have to be valid. They'll just publish that "X bad guy belongs to Y group" regardless if it's true or not. The next time some dude snaps and goes to shoot up a school, and they find that he played CoD once, all the media outlets will try to relate that guy to gamergate.	22
1	Seems legit.  Seriously though Sargon does have a point in say how in a sense GamerGate's won. Even though it's still a long way to go before victory is truly certain, let alone sustained.	22
1	I'm waiting for the headlines. "Arthur Chu fallaciously accused of being world war 2 kamikaze pilot by far-right terrorist organization."	22
0	&gt; I feel justified attributing those 2 incidents to SJWs.  I don't, for all we know it could have been some dipshit from our side false flagging so we could play the victim for once.   I'm not saying that was what happened, but I'm not the only one who this occurred to, am I?	22
0	It's your mind that defines who you are, not your fucking body.	22
0	okay first of all its lose (how does anyone confuse the two? its maddening), secondly why would you hold someone who does nothing but play pretend in high regard, and thirdly, it is foolish to think an elderly person will ever change their thoughts about anything. yes he is elderly, he is 62.	22
0	Indeed. It's a sure bet that GG will use his public email address to make his life as miserable as possible. It's a little surprising for KiA to admit this so openly because I thought you were still trying to maintain some kind of thin anti-harassment facade.	22
1	She doesn't shitpost, but she does troll a bit.  Yes, we should be proud of that. We've taught a middle aged woman (I'd hardly call her old) how to participate in modern internet humor/culture and she seems to genuinely understand and enjoy it.	22
1	There's something that feels quite good about this video.  Before, videos of Gamergate supporters contain individuals, who discuss with people over the internet, "silently".  Even discussions that are not video/audio-based are just words we read on the internet.  This video has people cheering/applauding, in person, over things that are common opinion/jokes of Gamergate.  Probably the first of its kind that I've seen since Gamergate started.  It's the feeling that you truly are not alone.	22

1	Did you try mentioning the law to Paradox? It seems like something they'd not want to ignore.	22
0	Hah. You realize most of the people here are in the camp of "let the voting system decide relevancy," right? I think if it were possible, most people would do away with the mod team and just let people decide what lives and dies by voting.	22

0	What context could you put "It ends tonight" in not to make it sound incredibly threatening?	22
1	Game and comic conventions reject us, and the only way to remedy this is to create our own.  If it ever got up to the convention size Im not talking about a gamergate circle jerk. Im talking about an actual convention like there are nowadays, but run by like minded people who wont censor and ban people for their views.	22

1	Right?  Nothing Francis has ever said goes against established Church tradition.  It's only "shocking" to people who don't know Church history.	23
1	Yes, they do, in fact believe these things. You should check out the South Park episode about it. It is Season 7, Episode 12 - All About Mormons. It tells the story of Joseph Smith and the seer stones, and whatever. It's pretty funny.	23
0	I think that God being a product of the human brain is becoming more and more evident. Faith isn't good enough any longer.	23

0	I think using s term to describe a specific type of Christian movement is incorrect. But it's probably more correct to think of ISIS as a combination of fundamentalism and communist vanguardism.	23
1	Just like everything else in religion.  Only monogamus realtionships = fewer STD spreading  bow instead of shaking hands = fewer germ spreading  Rest on satur/sunday = having a free day is good for the mental health and makes productivity higher on other days  and so on and on, you get the idea.  IMO it was always just a framework to build a society with a fixed set of rules.	23
0	This is cool. I loved learning about the double slit experiment in physics.	23
0	Wait, if theres no reason not to believe in god, does that mean you believe in all the gods?	23
1	I am religious, but also an atheist.  I follow a denomination of Buddhism that lets that seemingly contradictory sentence work. Thus, I participate in religious discussions as an atheist because I am also religious at the same time	23
0	You're still arguing for an entity of sorts. Smith a new word that doesn't imply an entity. In the end, this is just another interpretation that separates mankind.	23

0	That is servile: you are not supposed to be operating your taxi on shabbat.  Furthermore, it is made clear: both you AND your manservant and your maidservant must rest, so you must not make use of professional services, or servile work done by others (including gentiles, because it also says that the stranger must also be allowed to rest), on the Shabbat.  You can drive yourself, because this is not servile work; aka, professional work, as in you paying for a service, and giving another person a job to do ("Take me to this street").	23
0	&gt; G-d  ._.	23
0	I've noticed that your style of debate with me is devoid of substantiation, and the full of barbs. As for your helping me I seriously doubt this debate will ever come to that, and you have no idea what my religion sanctions. I would suggest you take up a study of mathematics and from that the odds of even the most simple life form coming from those odds. Perhaps then you could take another look at the real proof of how life and the universe came about and see the collosal hoax being played on a world wide scale.	23

0	Capitalist pop culture - celebrity worship.  Everyone who gets super excited about sports, really bad pop music, anime, sit coms, TV shows, stupid movies about nothing and anything else that is the giant sinking pile of rotting prolefeed that makes up a significant portion of western contemporary cultural "logos."	25
1	So any patriarchal, CIS (I am actually a bit proud that I don't know what that stands for), non-all gender pronouns respecting, heterosexual, fat-shaming, anti-child eating, holocaust denying male wanna hear some rapejokes?	25

1	What does this have to do with anything?	25
0	Nope sounds like a waste of time. I don't know either of them, why would I want to know her room number too?	25
1	There debate over what a non gendered singular pronoun should be. Zhe, ze, xe, xhe, xir and zie are all contenders and all equally retarded. A singular version of "they" is also used and is probably the best option, but gets grammar nazis collective panties in a bunch.  Tumbltards also have "neo-pronoun" such as "fae" "drae" "plu" "and thousands more, many of which are unique to the individual and often based off they're kintype. Pretty much a giant mockery of actual transpeople, without meaning to, but they're that desperate to be oppressed.	25
0	well, I definitely censure *some* people's usernames...  (Serious answer: rule of thumb is it depends if the subreddit you're submitting it to would go out of their way to brigade - better safe than sorry in most cases though)	25
1	Whoever made this is the Michaelangelo of autism.	25
0	I didn't want to suggest the sub ban any words, just that maybe we should use it less.  But I see you point in prohibiting language. That's not the intent. I just think we can be more creative.	25
0	Probably removed for the title. I mean, come on.	25
0	I don't really get the "no future employment" argument against these things. I mean, for a kid wanting a large, visible tattoo, yeah, but by the time you get this far you're either an artist/musician and it doesn't matter, work in the tattoo/piercing industry, or don't make your money legally. I bet most of these people are perfectly fine with the idea lf never working an office job.	25
1	/u/sailorbotan hahaha you are one sad fucking dick dude. I hope this makes you reconsider yourself a little. Go have a walk in the park, breath a little, pick yourself back up. Like, goddamn, I haven't seen any one pull some lowly shit like this in a long, long time.	25

0	Mainstream society is just as embarrassing as the weeaboos for the most part - they just don't realize it because they're mainstream and the electric kike in their living room they worship confirms their supposed normalcy to them.  I will confess I find men who like sexy anime drawings less strange than people who, for example, males who put pictures of male athletes in tight pants - or worse: WWE wrestlers or UFC fighters and the like on their walls...	25

1	This is... sad. It's just fucking sad is what it is. It went from being really awkward, right through fucking hilarious, and came to rest in some weird, dark, socially disconnected place where the people who shoot up schools and/or kill themselves live. I don't know that I've ever seen a group of people so desperate for attention and approval, and so powerless to get it.	25

I had my 4 years in the Navy, I didn't do shit.

0	So you represent everyone? Nice superiority complex. Where does the word hypocrite come into play? Or are you just throwing your vocabulary words out to make use of them?

0	There's nothing wrong with being a furry.  There *is* however, something very off-putting about sharing your fetishes publicly.  Can you imagine someone with a scat fetish making that publicly known all the time?  Just rubbing shit on their face while they walk down the street?	25

0	Yeah, furries agree with you, and I would rather have -1000 votes than have even a single furry agree with me.  Edit: They are absolutely for sex appeal, I mean that's why pedos need anime of young boys/girls, without it they wouldn't find any sex appeal in it. It's not that the human body is enough, they need the animal parts to get off, because of that they definitely are into bestiality to varying extents.	25
1	I laughed, if it didn't have the emo picture this would've been a quality /r/wtf post.

1	Throw me to the wolves and I will try unsuccessfully to outrun them. One of them will bite my leg and I don't think I'll know the force of a wolf bite until I feel the force of a wolf bite. So I'll probably be paralyzed with pain and fear while the whole pack kills me.   ftfy	25

0	Let me tell you where your wrong. First of all, it's ponies so it's inherently cute and ripe for sexualizing (humans find younger, cuter girls more sexy than old wrinkly women, don't you agree?). And secondly, this fetish is called inflation. And it's a really hot fetish. It involves inflating the stomach and guts, which results in a beautiful big belly which is oh so hot. don't agree? Then sorry, but you're wrong.	25
1	Meh. Dude was just trying to be nice.	25
1	You get angry at people for believing his words but expect people to trust yours.  That's the hypocrisy.  Pretty obvious, but I guess it's expecting too much of you to get it.   LOL oh honey. You can dish everything out but as soon as it comes to taking it you turn into a little baby. People HAVE to have an ulterior motive to disagree with you.

1	FNAF is really weird to me because the fandom consists almost entirely of two of the most annoying groups of people on the planet  We have furries on one end, and twelve year olds on the other  I can understand why dogfuckers would be attracted to a game where you're trapped in a room with animals or something (mrowr) but I never understood why children were always so fixated on horror stuff like this. Remember Slender or the Ben Drowned creepypasta? FNAF is the new version of that and I never understood why.	25

1	Oooh good question. I discovered the whole thing by a TV show and it supplied little information about furries so I began surfing the web for info. Eventually I found furaffinity and several channels on YouTube. 14 year old me thought it would be a swell idea to document a con for the world to see (I aspired to be a journalist, mind you). I started talking to furries on YouTube and they seemed pretty nice so I started befriending them, then little by little I just became one myself. Then that's when I got really into it.	25

0	Is that a crossley? I really hope his record player isn't a crossley. That shit will tear your records up, given enough time.	25
0	Problem? I was just pointing out the stupidity of doing so. Why are you dragging this out?	25
0	The one on the second row, farthest right, has a good message to it, despite being a meme.	25
0	Which is why I called it quartz in a pile of shit.  I don't judge something good as bad for being popular.  I judge bad things that are, regardless, popular, as bad.  Led Zepplin was popular, but Kashmir is genius.  Supertramp was popular, but Breakfast in America is a masterpiece.  Pink Floyd was popular and Animals is a phenomenal album.  NCIS is popular and is extremely boring, formulaic, stock and hackneyed, and "propagandistic".	25

0	Eh they're just kids, nothing really cringy here. But where did that one get a furry mask from 0_0	25

1	Plus the whole "Bi people are just confused!" thing.	25
1	I guess you could say it's her... Privilege?	25
1	It's because these kinds of contracts are very restrictive (in a bad way) and aren't necessarily healthy behavior because there's no way to go back on it. Proper BDSM requires a lot of communication about boundaries and compromises should be made. You can't just write down a list of things you want your partner to do and then force them to sign it.	25
1	Um yeah.. You haven't played any telltale games?	25

0	~~How about "Having a drug addiction isn't crazy."? That *could be considered as* wrong, if you're addicted to drugs, you've *most likely* got a problem.~~  ~~They're plenty of other examples showing that you can't replace "fetish" with another thing, and keep the statement I made correct.~~  Analogies are hard ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^sometimes .	25

0	It's a shortened version of my old 4chan handle, sempais_pleasurous_nutrients	25
0	&gt;It proves how desperate people are to attribute meaning where there is none and collectively share the experience as part of an in-group - even if all it amounts to is a countdown timer. The shitty memes, the obsession over hierarchies and labels, the annihilating desperation for it to actually mean something. All it proves is how gullible, bored, and lonely so many people are.  I see you post on /r/theredpill... How delicious the irony is	25
1	Because him knowing it by heart and never having talked to her is beyond creepy. The video is true cringe.	25
0	This is one of the most cancerous attempts at irony ever. It uses dead, unfunny memes like Shrek and Pepe and unironically associates itself with 4chan. I actually want to die listening to this.	25
1	Brony *and* an ungrateful son?  I deduce the father was not present in his upbringing.	25

0	"Oh balls"   Pls kill me	25
1	I mean, uncle grandpa is pretty fucking stupid	25
0	Oh piss off, if you don't think that look takes effort you know nothing of the subject you speak off, this person obviously likes that look and enjoys being androgynous i.e. presenting stereotypic male and female characteristics. Go crawl back under your rock in your mothers basement.	25
0	What the hell? This chick looks almost exactly like a girl I used to be friends with.  She also went to tumblr, tried too hard to be quirky, and needless to say, she had severe mental problems. We were pretty close... for a while... but she just was way too much, getting angry for nothing. We ended up fighting pretty severely.  After remembering all ths, I feel like fapping to her.  EDIT: AMA	25
1	Not seen: the bottle still on the cap because his dad would get *so* pissed if he saw any beer missing	25
0	Doesn't really matter. Saterically or not, it's equally cringey.	25
0	being homosexual has nothing to do with being a furry, asshole	25
0	&gt;calling out people for calling out people on the internet  How pedantic of you to say that.	25
0	How does not believing in some stupid fairy tale make me a neckbeard?	25
0	Those comments are a gold mine of cringe. Also, are we suppose to feel bad for the bronys or something? Because in the video aren't they invading?	25
1	haha yea for his penis	25
1	Just fucking wow.  Was it during peak business hours? Sure seemed like it.  Was he demanding more than a refund? Yup.  Did he *actually argue with a food label?* Oh yeah.  The day I get a customer arguing with food is the day I walk out.	25
0	Can I be the problem too please faggot?	25
0	wow you just made me cringe like 8 times and probably gave me ulcers all over my body plus red eye wtf. thats so cringe man. *pic of the sad 4chan frog, but it has ulcers, aids and cancer drawn on it with pink eye*	25
0	I can, it's very easy. I compartmentalize nearly all of my interactions. Unless I know someone really well it's how I interact with everybody sexual or not. It's not an exceedingly rare or negative thing to do either. There is a difference between distance and malice.	25
1	Not Left 4 Dead though!	25
1	I'm pretty sure whoever made this comic was making a joke about people like that.	25
1	The worst part is how you can see the eraser lines :/  He felt that the belly wasn't big enough like 2 times... He ended up making it as big as the page allowed lol	25

0	Na I just find it funny in a sub dedicated to making fun of people, this is what's downvoted.  I mean seriously I could call him autistic and get upvotes, but not a faggot?	25

0	Yeah, their sit-coms, which went out of popularity years ago, probably before Bronies existed.   I'm giving you reason and all you're giving is downvotes. You're a dumbass.	25

1	I'm never having kids.	25
0	Possibly. In some countries Facebook is the internet, which is incredibly unfortunate.   I don't see anything wrong here really. The anime character isn't sexualized. Hell it's not even 'super cute'. As far as opposite gender goes, how do we know that? Do you mean opposite sex? Even then, there shouldn't be an issue. If it is, I'd fault any culture that says so.	25

0	TBH; I can't cringe to this. I cringe to most furries, but I'm all about being proud of whatever you are. I'm proud of being asian. I used to believe my race was even the origin of all asian races and the master race. I'm proud of being proud, I'm proud of being short, I'm proud of all things I am because pride is a healthy thing.  ....just my two cents, I can't cringe at healthy pride *edit* also feel free to downvote, dipshit :) idgaf.	25
0	I don't hate anyone, so long as they don't initiate the use of force against people.  In person I treat everyone as they treat me or better.    I'm not particularly fond of faggots, kikes, niggers, and fatties, but I wouldn't say I hate them. I'll accept anyone in my home who I feel is a decent, non violent person.    I do think homosexuality is degenerate deviancy, but I don't hate gays. When they wear their illness on their sleeve it just annoys me.	25
1	Wait. Just so we're clear, you saved this image for YEARS, just to post it on reddit to be an asshole to this kid with your made up stories?  Jesus, that's some serious commitment to being a piece of shit. Good job jackass.	25

1	Jesus, didn't all that trendy Wicca shit die out around the late '90s? I had a friend who was super into that scene at that time. Fuck, he was annoying.	25
1	Didn't someone on Reddit ask for legal advice because he got caught after bragging about stealing Yugi-yo cards before?  Edit: Here it is. Turns out it was magic cards. Oh well, still stupid too. https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/30g99l/user_brags_of_repeatedly_shoplifting_from_walmart/	25

0	I really hope this turns into a copypasta.	25
0	I don't think it's trans. It doesn't look like it's trying to be any gender in particular. Looks like a tumblrina trying to make some sort of statement.	25
1	Meninism is literally a word-for-word parody of feminism, and the only cringe is when feminists get angry at it for "legitimate reasons."  In case you don't get it, every argument used by feminists against the *satirical joke of meninism* is an argument against feminism.   It's very obvious satire, OP.	25
1	Ahahahahaha! *deep inhale* hahahaha!	25
0	Yeah, its not like women do the same shit to men on a daily basis, amirite?  IMO, If a shitty image macro joke hurts your feelings then you are too sensitive.	25
1	At my high school (in Alaska, coincidentally) there was a pack of kids like this who wore disgusting sweatshirts and jeans, never showered, were obnoxiously open about their feelings, and always drank monsters. When I went to college in Arizona my friend from Idaho said his school had the same thing and he had a name for them.  "Dirt-asses." These people are "dirt-asses." Perfect name.	25
1	There was only one set of footprints. I don't understand why, when I needed you the most, you would leave me."   He whispered, "My precious child, I love you and will never leave you.  When you saw only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried youu oo oo AA AA."	25

1	Yeah posting from 9gag in this sub is pretty much cheating.	25
0	It's genuinely one of the best memes I've ever seen.	25
0	We aren't mocking it 'because it's trans' and to be honest I doubt it is. I'm pretty sure it's an SJW with a special snowflake complex fighting the 'patriarchy' by not conforming to social norms. I'm a part of the LGBT community and honestly, either way, it looks pretty cringe worthy.	25
1	Runescape is, was and always will be frowned up on. Except in 2005-2007 everybody was secretly playing it...	25
0	&gt;tumblr  &gt;satire  Pick one. Tumblrettes are genuinely fucking insane.	25
0	Before I say anything, I have to clarify that I am an animal caregiver and I have been taking care of pets for 5 years. With that out of the way, I really do like these little comics, they are really are creative and crazy for a gore fan like myself. I've only seen a few  on 4chan a few years ago, and I am impressed that there are animations now.	25
1	Aren't these protests usually held at front of on-topic buildings, in city centres or other busy places? What is the point of protesting if nobody is even seeing?  Tbh, they probably were afraid that someone actually would see them...	25
1	Holy shit i should do that for a living.	25

0	You even tried again after it didn't work... you sure you're not a furry?	25
0	Omg I was really good friends with this kid when I was in high school. He's a year below me but all of this is completely sarcastic and not meant to be taken seriously at all. He's awesome in real life	25
1	why would anybody move to japan? it's way too overcrowded. if you just want to move their for anime and stuff, you are retarded	25
0	OH. MY. GOD.	25
1	Cringe aside. The line "everytime I finger a girl I put her on her period" was fucking golden. That was an unexpected laugh in an ocean of cringe.	25
0	Apparently you're not much of a thinking man, I can respect that.  But you should desire a culture conducive to the healthy propagation of your progeny which is not a culture of neanderthal hypermasculine idiocy like is pushed by contemporary WWE soap-operas.	25
0	Because the game is quite fun	25
0	Hahaha what a faggot hahahahah	25
0	A faggot?   Edit: o is this one of those nono words this sub hates?	25
1	Good question. I think it has to do something with it being something human, but not human, being inside you or you being inside it.	25
1	This is literally fucking small-town America. The highlight of their day is walking up a shitty half-paved road into a giant mega-walmart that is empty, and flaunting their furry tales, before they go home to their 1 story suburban house and jerk off.	25
1	Er, how is he a white knight? Dude was just giving advice.	25
0	Is it normal for adults to like shounen manga? No. Its normal for us to read shounen manga thats been going on since we were kids because we're all masochists though.	25
1	I can't get over how he is more into the dance then the pop star.	25
0	The christian prays for the man and he drowns anyway.	25
1	I stopped cutting earlier this year. To the point of your friend, I could have cut into muscle. But that could do some serious permanent damage. So instead I would do 14 or 15 shallower (not shallow, shallower) cuts down my upper arm. Still drew lots of blood and still accomplished what I "wanted." (Whatever the hell that was, I never did fully understand it, though I kind of had an idea at the end). But I do agree that this kid really is not cutting.	25
0	my apologies, hopefully you can view this when you can access a computer	25
0	so, no? you can't explain why? its ok. nobody ever can. lots of people always have something stupid and snarky to say or just tell me to "chill out" and I get lots of downvotes for calling this shit out, but nobody can ever acknowledge or dispute my point.	25
0	Don't you have other stations you can listen to? I have like 10 different ones here.	25
0	Wow... just wow... it's 2015 and you people think it's funny to just post a picture of a lovely trans woman to laugh at her?	25
1	"disrespecting the troops" means not worshiping them or the MI complex sufficiently.	25
0	My problem with this shit is that it's just fluff. It doesn't provide any talking points about any specific topic or conspiracy. It's like someone is trying to act cool by having an unpopular belief about something.  And in regards to my original comment, this picture probably got upvoted so heavily because it tickles the fancy of conspiracy theorists and it makes us look bad to those who don't like our community.	25
0	I mean, I've listened to pretty much every genre of metal for around 8 years now, and black metal has always been my least favorite of the genres, aside from, of course, the genres that ended with "core".	25

1	I watched Steven Universe the other day. It's a really intense show. This kid's mom was killed in battle fighting in a foursome of celestial beings called crystal gems and he has to step up and take her place when he's like 12 years old. I thought it was a goofy comedy show.   I saw Clarence too. That shit is funny. Whoever writes the scripts for cartoons today is way better than they used to be. there goes my karma	25

0	How so? I'm not harassing him about it or posting anything online that could possibly tell anyone it's him.	25
0	Eh. I probably wouldn't suit in public (unless it's at a con or something).  And it's normal to be weird about people. You just have to dig deeper and judge them by their personalities. Some people feel the same way about furries, so it's important to practice what you preach.	25
1	Not all of them are teenagers	25
0	Well, for one, he doesnt even look fully white, but maybe half asian like Keanu Reeves, so it's a bit hypocritical to be picky about race when his race isn't even clear.  Although the main impression I get from his list is that he gets most of his knowledge of women from 4chan and /r/tumblrinaction. I really doubt there are that many stereotypical "SJW" women in Knoxville, to the point that he has to brush them off of him.	25
0	Just a comment on your thought process, or lack thereof	25

1	*Radical* feminism has always been a joke. It's a shame what they've done to feminism, because all feminism is about is gender equality, focusing on the issues women face in particular. But now whenever it's mentioned people think of these asshats.  Edit: I'm going by literal sociological definitions &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;	25

0	Bernie Sanders will remove the conformist chip cookie from 'murica.	25
1	Reddit is like 90% easily digestable content in form of dank maymays and anecdotes. How can anyone even develope the idea of reddit being a place for "intellectuals"? Because of the amount of people using a thesaurus on /r/atheism??	25

0	Not at all confused. She looks like a very confident and proud transgender girl. Too bad this sub just isn't mature enough to handle it.	25
1	Do these people not realize their brains would shrink, thus making them fucking retarded on a whole new level?	25
1	All of them ? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)	25
0	Meh, not that cringy, just some kid having a fun fantasizing	25
1	She has a patreon. What the fuck? Who would donate to this bitch?	25
1	For real. Most people who self-harm or have a mental condition would never try and justify their actions as being good or reasonable, and I think it's only really cringey when they do. Saying "I cut myself because I have a dark soul and am so tortured and emo" is cringey, saying "yeah, I had a mental disorder and I can't really say why I made some of the stupid mistakes I did, but here was kind of my thought process at the time" is not.	25
1	Like 3rd highest rated comment.   "I'm gonna be honest I am pretty sure if people don't understand the "nine" they will thing you are birthing a literal cocksucker and the banana is its training or something."  Fucking Kek'd m8.	25
1	I blame the spanish inqusition.	25
0	Well it is a hotbed for autism. Hell they even use it to teach mentally deficient adults so yeah pretty accurate.	25
0	They're the same thing and also still doesn't change the fact that anime isn't as deep or sophisticated of a medium as you'd like to think it is.	25
0	It is cartoon porn. That's fucked up	25
0	Yup. Do some research.	25
1	i had a quick scroll through your profile and all you mostly do is post on this sub or other ones meant for making fun of people. To me that shows you're probably a pretty cringeworthy person. That's just my opinion though. I honestly do not care who's right.	25
1	she probably has enough white knights on steam that she has all teh games she wants paid for	25
0	Yes, it is your fault you're still using facebook when there's dozens of better options. It's also you're fault that you apparently refuse to unfriend people you do not like. I'm glad we agree.	25

0	Considering you're attempting to dig through my posts, yes, you are attempting to stalk me. Notice the difference, attempting to stalk versus stalking. Or are you too stupid to read things correctly?  "Buddies"? More like we all share the same discontent for albro and enjoy calling him on his bullshit. You wanted proof? How's about the various people that saw this shit posted? Or is the ad populum fallacy only applicable when it's used against you? Hypocritical trash.	25
0	this is the demographic that goes to a music festival and calls it a rave	25

0	What are you talking about?  It's just pants, a plain black hoodie and a motorcycle jacket.  Pretty typical here in Kiev. Is that considered weird in your part of the world?	25
1	As long as it doesn't involve diapers, I'll say it isn't as bad.	25

0	Dude wearing a dress....fucked in the head	25
1	"Oh, and Mom, can you buy me some chicken tendies when you come home from work?"	25
0	There is absolutely nothing cringeworthy about this. The funny fact is, if a female were to do the same exact thing, we wouldn't be making fun of her and posting her on /r/CringeAnarchy. I actually support this dude, he knows what he wants and that is good.	25
1	Yeah I didn't even imagine it as some crazy looking guy as in the illustration, all I'm getting is very desperate, very average teen boy.	25
1	I recall the person drawing the "Rape Jokes are bad immediately " drew some Rape fantasy drawing of Naruto getting peed on and such and on being called out on it had a mental breakdown.  Classic stuff.	25
1	No,  That's  just the alpha  wolf wearing your fedora after the pack eats you. I can tell by analysing the blood on the hat for Cheetos residue and trace amounts  of Mountain Dew	25
0	A female demographic anime for casuals.	25
0	Makes it easier to call people out, especially if people are saying shit like "That's not all of us, it's just the bad ones!" but they themselves are submitting stuff to furry/brony/??? subreddits worse than the post in question.	25
1	This is satire, just so you know.  Doesn't stop it from being hilarious.	25

1	I'm a total douche because I just think that's kinda cute. Ugh.	25
1	Thx. I'd much rather look at this.	25
1	Seems like the fetish is less about shaving heads and more about humiliation and power. If you notice many of them are crying as it is something they are not wanting to do and being forced to. To lose something that helps define who they are.  Kinda disturbing actually.	25

1	I find odd comfort in knowing that his dude doesn't get off to soiled diapers of child like animals and instead the diaper is filled with water from a hose. Still insane, but one notch below some of the crazy dirty diaper/furry stuff I've seen on this sub. You people have scarred me.	25

0	I can't agree with this one. Wife was too hot.	25
0	I'm aware they find the term "tranny" offensive. I simply don't give a damn. It only became offensive because they decided it should be. And yeah. Clearly I should walk a mile in the shoes of a tranny because they're just so "oppressed". Should I also walk a mile in the shoes of a paedophile? Do they also need "love" and "understanding"? Why don't we create "safe spaces" and parades for them too?	25
1	I think I remember reading that it was a hoax and that it was only a small amount of people doing this, nowhere near a trend. But I remember the media freaking out about it.	25

0	Eh... I was unsure about using that word - I've never quite had a grasp on what it means.  It might not be.  I just meant "that's totally internet."	25
1	Are you kidding me? He hit 100% of the stereotypical 'molester' marks. Hair, mustache, expression, EVERYTHING. He could change just one of these and cut the number of comparisons in half. Easy.

0	Most of those are problems with the state. Feminism is not about collapsing the state, so the free market can correct this. It's about using state power to control men.    I'm not going to click any of those links because I'm shitting and don't really care too, but I'll respond to the caregiver thing as best as I can.   There are no men standing at the doors of research buildings blocking the way for women, or denying them entry into universities to study. Women have evolved to be care givers, and just on average aren't interested in science like men are who have evolved to be protectors and producers.	25

0	&gt;liking dadrock  edit: aw did I strike a nerve	25
0	I'm not really sure what that's saying. The ponies are not created with furries in mind? I don't see how that changes the fact that they fall into the category by definition. That's like me saying Mario isn't a human because Miyamoto wasn't thinking of humans as a species at the time. I understand most furries are creepy and delusional, so I'm not really apt to trust their opinions.	25

0	If some bitch is so dumb and shitty at planning that she walks alone at 3:00AM she almost deserves to get raped.    But also, if some bitch is walking alone at 3:00AM she's probably fat and/or ugly and has little to worry about. Attractive women don't walk alone at 3:00AM because their looks will have helped them acquire money to buy a car or take a cab, or will have a male companion to drive them.	25
0	People doing something badly doesn't necessarily make something cringey.	25
1	I am actually autistic and I often ask if people are autistic in a joking way. I don't feel entirely guilty about it, since I have pretty low social awareness... but for people who know I have it they tend to get a kick out of the irony of it.	25

0	I did go to public school and was glued to the electric jew. Amazingly I turned out a leftist who believed himself to be transgender. There's no way any of those things I did in my formative years had anything to do with it though, so who knows why people become faggots.   What can I say, women secretly enjoy rape and kikes should be gassed.	25

0	It would be really fascinating to have some studies done.. I think a lot of it comes from fixation as a coping mechanism, and there might be some overlap with autism in there although I don't want to claim that all furries are autistic.	25

D: They're Sega of America and the Sonic series and countless Alien games are the only ones keeping them alive.	25
1	I'm really awkward at school, but I do have a lot of people who accept me. I talk to them regularly. Though today I was feeling really depressed that I don't really have a lot of people that I hang out with. I felt really ashamed that I have somewhat poor social skills. Then I watched this video and I feel way better now that I know I'm nowhere as near as retarded as this bitch you shown me.   Thank you OP.	25

1	How much engagement does someone need beyond being told point-blank that someone doesn't want to do anything with you, doesn't want anything from you, and doesn't want to be your friend?   I do think this kid had issues in some way -- I mean past the point of social awkwardness and in the realm of something clinically significant and diagnosable -- but that isn't the responsibility of the people around him to deal with. They were already going above and beyond the call of duty by patiently explaining that she wanted nothing to do with him.   No one's owed an explanation for why someone doesn't want to be friends with him/her.	25

1	They've tried different things, but whenever there are photos involved it is usually the "before" and the one with my cousin.  In a way, I kind of owe them a thanks.  They gave me my first taste of this kind of thing at a young age, so it doesn't bother me anymore lol.    I was a bit surprised to see this pop up, as I haven't seen them in months.  The last time I remember is when I got pulled into a Skype group.  Their persistence would be admirable if it were used for a better cause.  lol  EDIT: was to were derp	25

I don't think anyone has the right to comment on a country that they have never been to. I don't want to go to America particularly, but if I get the opportunity I will jump at the chance. Never make the mistake of assuming or presuming about these things, experience different thing.	25

0	Sure. Religion just gets to declare their point of view and not be called out on their nonsense? You're the biggest closet apologist I've ever seen.  There is no merit in religious "evidence" to propose a god exists. In fact, the whole dogma is about FAITH. You simply must believe it is true.  And you have the audacity to call me ignorant?  You're bewildered.	25

0	I wouldn't try to make any claims about feminism with that username.	26
1	That's a pretty good argument, you've sold me. She should have taken responsibility for her own life.  I don't think that takes all the responsibility off of those instituting sexist policies though.	26
1	She's 19 and in law school! Wtf!	26
0	British women are disgusting. You got some hot models, those page 3 chicks are nice.  They got a little more meat on their bones than American models. In a good way. Elizabeth Hurley, she's  hot. But the average cockney, street urchin,  slag,  like these right here, yeeeech!	26

0	For disagreeing, that's what the downvote button means.	26
0	She was so hot though. Like 10/10.    And age is just a number.  Sometimes "kids" want to do that stuff.  I NEEDED that.  Like for real.	26
0	It's difficult / impossible to know without seeing the guy's injuries.  I will say that 16 months is IMO a long time.  Maybe not *too* long but it is a pretty large chunk of a person's life.	26

0	Do you have no self-awareness, or do you just want attention?   Edit: Don't answer. It's both.	26
0	How can you make these assumptions?  She's already racked up numerous charges and will possibly become a felon.    I think you've got a chip on your shoulder.	26
1	No but seriously, why is it always "pressure of her peers?" They say the same thing about women math and science scores, and that they don't reflect their actual scores due to pressures and anxieties.  http://www.apa.org/research/action/stereotype.aspx  &gt;it's become clear that negative stereotypes raise inhibiting doubts and high-pressure anxieties in a test-taker's mind, resulting in the phenomenon of "stereotype threat."	26
1	Typical female excuse:  It's not me, it's society, my husband, my parents, church, local police department, vague laws, ANYTHING ELSE BUT ME!!!  Come on let's be real here. If that church was telling people to have sex with their own kids, it would be known. People would had put some stuff about it on the internet, people would be talking, it wouldn't all be swept under the rug!	26
1	What kind of prosecutor agrees with 3 years with 2 being suspended for minor alcohol use, DUI, negligent homicide and leaving the scene of an accident? If that is not easily 5 years if the suspect pleads guilty so they don't have to face 12 or more years in custody.	26
0	That's not really the question here.	26
0	You're an idiot.	26
1	I think that's a legitimate debate that many would agree with on here. The outrage is over the reaction that would be received if the genders were reversed. The same people who cry "NICE" here would be calling for castration.	26
0	See my comment below: what do you expect a pregnant crack addict to do?  And how do criminal charges help the situation? (Hint: they achieve nothing).	26
0	In "my world", yes, all consensual acts are legal. But here in the real world, you think crack mom's enjoyed privileged status because they weren't prosecuted? For what? Possession? Showing signs of past use?	26
1	However there's the reverse here: http://miami.cbslocal.com/2015/05/04/driver-at-fault-in-fatal-wrong-way-wreck-to-be-sentenced/  Interesting they were both on my front page.	26
1	Yeeeeeaaaah, he was an asshole, but I feel like adultery doesn't call for capital punishment.	26
1	/u/whatsaphoto explains why it shouldn't really be a surprise coming from Tony Stark, but 'Prima Nocta' is an old time "right" to allow nobles to have sex with the wife of a newly married man on the night of their wedding.  Tony Stark made a joke about it while trying to lift the hammer. It should really not be a big deal.	26
1	They didn't like how Hawkeye's wife was portrayed, the lack of Gwyneth and Natalie and how Black Widow brought up being unable to be a mother (even though it was contextually relevant) as their main complaints of sexism, the last reason was also "triggering".	26
1	What you are saying is so fucked up.	26
0	Then you should have said that, it comes off insulting the other way	26
1	The real pussypass here is that no man, ever, will be able to use this excuse.  No matter the size of the man or woman, the extenuating circumstances, or the degree of injury, as long as the woman states the male was "acting aggressive" short of murder she'll get off.  Even with proof no man could say that a woman was the aggressor so he responded with violence.  He'd be crucified.	26

0	I'm an idiot for not understanding what is so threatening by the letter 'k'?	26
0	Yep, and if I thought I was in danger, I'd do the same.  But if someone smacks me after I made a dumbass comment about their nose, I'd grow the fuck up and wouldn't stay pissed at them for hours.  I'm not excusing what anyone did, I'm just saying that both people involved were being completely petty and immature.  And tying someones hair to their shoes after they fall asleep is just downright retarded. Grow the fuck up.	26
0	Short of banning all female twitch streamers there isn't much you can do about it. Women have a competitive advantage when it comes to online streaming stemming from their sex appeal, which they know how to exploit to its full potential. It's irrational to get upset over it, on twitch or in meatspace, -- it's reality and that's all there is to it. You can't change it.  Btw, it's not porn as the girls don't get naked. Porn is against twitch TOS.	26
0	People on this sub are starting to sound like meninists.	26
0	I get what you're attempting to say here but breaking the circlejerk will have you crucified.  I think above was mocking the "teach men not to rape" notion, not suggesting that either gender needs to be specifically called out.  Rape is rape. Gender matters not in a crime so heinous and damaging. Male or female, those who commit the crime have subjected the victim to an incredibly harmful, traumatic experience and should be brought to justice.	26
1	wow, this is all news to me. And frankly most of these criticisms are just silly. There are several equivalents for the male characters in the movie. Seriously, modern feminism disgusts me.	26

1	It's bad if you think she should go free for it.	26
0	I'm not sure what you're trying to say....   The numbers I cited say that men make up a tenth of reported rapes and of those male victims, less than a a tenth of those cases of rape were perpetrated by a woman.    I fail to see how saying that a 10th of all rape victims are male is somehow denying they even exist...	26

1	There's no cure for being a cunt	26
1	Why would *attempted* rape carry any less of a sentence than a successful rape? Just because your ineptitude or the tenacity of your victim(s) prevented you from carrying out the crime to fruition? It seems like that should be punished just as harshly as if you succeeded.	26
1	Nothing is uglier than a mugshot of a cunt who got caught and tried to cry her way out of it. She looks like a fuckin mess and should be in a mental institution	26

0	&gt;– 1 in 10 rape victims are men. (Rathus, Nevid and Fichner-Rathus, 568)    – In a survey answered by hundreds of rape and sexual assault support agencies estimated that... of male rape perpetrators... 6.3 percent were female. (Greenberg, Bruess and Haffner, 575)    [Source](http://thehathorlegacy.com/rape-statistics/)  Not arguing that any form of rape is OK just pointing out that, in regards to your "teach women to cut back on it" point, female on male rape makes up a fraction of a percent of all rape.	26

0	You only need to have sex once to conceive. Let's say it took three dates before having sex. How much do you really know the other person. The addicted might be able to pass it off. Or she wasn't addicted to crack yet and became so while pregnant.	26
1	Front-facing camera and a guy doing what appears to be pointing the rear facing camera at her kids?   Not defending her actions, but it doesn't seem very far fetched. Of course, who cares what he was taking a picture of? It's just a picture of kids at a public place.	26
1	What the actual shit.	26
0	We do stupid things when we're in love I guess.  And if you think I have no respect for her then you're wrong, I cared about her, and still do, I could never hate her. When you feel like you've been hurt by someone you care about then you emotions get mixed up and strangle at your heart.	26

0	Imagine if one of the girl decoys did this if an attractive guy came on.	26
0	I'm saying that while ALL rape is a problem and the clear cut facts I've cited don't warrant the charged wording you used in your initial comment.    You said    &gt;Teach men not to rape, but first try and teach women to cut back on it.     From the data I've provided, you're saying that only when the women who make up a fraction of a percent of rape perpetrators stop what they are doing...  Only then can we begin to teach the male 99% not to rape.	26
0	Even going to their houses is a bit too far a punishment for a stupid tweet on the internet.	26

0	Accusers shouldn't be worried of punishment if their rape accusations are not proven. Innocent until *proven* guilty works for *everyone*.	26
1	Because some states define rape as forcible penetration. Meaning a woman can't do it without a tool or finger penetration. I would have to see how Washington and the Seattle define rape.	26
1	This article could be aptly titled *"Higher Education in the SJW-era: The View from the Playpen"*	26
1	Not trying to be be buzz kill but sometimes judges do this for guys too. Not enough information in the article to really say if this is a full fledged pass.   Did she know they were going to kill the guy? Was she just along for the ride and played no real part or did she know beforehand and pull the trigger of her own volition. Need to know the context before we can issue a pass.	26
0	Rule #2  &gt;2) "The outcome would have been different for a man" is not strong enough to stand on its own. The offender must have used (or been granted) a pass based on their gender; e.g. motherhood, PMS, perceived 'weaknesses'. Posts made on flimsy grounds will be removed.	26

1	It takes a lot to make me cry. Dear Zachary did more then make me cry, it made me pissed the fuck off. How did she not get sentenced guilty for the murder earlier, and how the actual fuck did she ever get custody of the child.	26

0	As a single white male I will never ever ever approach children under any circumstances.  - Kid on their own in the mall? go fuck yourself - Kid looking lost in the street at 3am? nope! - Kid being lead away by someone who looks like they don't know them? not getting involved  Don't get me wrong, I would call the police if I thought the kid was in danger, but if a kid is just lost I'm not going to risk helping them because society believes all single white men are pedophiles. Fuck you society.	26
1	Good find.  They closed the comments, cowards.	26
1	A lot of feminists say that very thing.	26
0	A more extreme example then.  Its illegal for the same reason prison guards shouldn't be allowed to have sex with inmates.  And a 17 year old isn't an adult.	26
0	That's an odd stance to take, considering your (these groups of subreddits) hatred of the state of false accusations.   My point is there is no evidence of what the title states.   It's one word against another, and with two scenarios;   1. They had sex and had a child. The man does not want to pay child support.   2. She somehow managed to keep sperm in her mouth long enough for the man to leave, which she then used to impregnate herself, for an undisclosed reason.  I will take the more probable one until concrete evidence is given.   I will not spread sensationalist titles which are not based on evidence.	26
0	I see no problem here.	26
0	I would never claim normal. But if some guy I knew was fucking my gf I would probably assault him if I caught them in the act.	26

0	[Not a pussypass](https://www.reddit.com/r/PussyPass/comments/2zwcih/lets_talk_about_rule_2_the_outcome_would_have/)  In fact it literally says something along the lines of crimes/probation in that post itself:  &gt;Not a pussy pass: Woman gets probation for throwing her neighbor's dog in a wood chipper  &gt;Pussy pass: Woman gets probation for throwing her neighbor's dog in a wood chipper, judge states "This woman was just under a lot of stress, and her children need their mum"  Just doing a crime and getting probation is circumstantial at best.	26

0	You got that through context sure, but the big reveal in that scene was that she was sterilized.   Even if you make the argument that we're meant to take her entire dark past as qualifications for her "monster" status it still really makes no sense compared to Banner's plight.   Want to stop being an assassin? OK, just don't kill people anymore; pretty easy. Want to stop becoming the Hulk? Exhibit perfect and uninterrupted emotional control for the rest of your life or else become an unstoppable destructive force with no regard for the health and safety of others.   Not really comparable...	26
1	A short detour off the nearest cliff maybe	26
1	Real talk, I'm tired of seeing the word "triggered" with no explanation behind it. Ok, you're triggered, but triggered how? Are you having a total mental breakdown, or are you just annoyed and tweeting about it? Does "shutting down" mean that you're hyperventilating in class unable to talk, or that you've heard something that offended you and you're really just sulking?      Whenever someone uses the word "trigger" and they aren't talking about guns, I stop listening.	26
0	Due to her being intoxicated at the scene of the crime, I think it's near enough impossible to say that she  did or did not intent on harming the daughter. I'm not saying she didn't mean to do it, but from a legal standpoint you just can't prove attempted murder in this scenario.	26
1	&gt;Don't let the dream of every student go to prison  Umm, what?!?	26

1	It's kinda funny most so called "intellectuals" are very left wing and almost communist and a mastermind of communism Joseph Stalin hated intellectuals. Also fuck them everyone has the right to say what they want and those terrorists are criminals as they committed murder the cartoonists only exercised their freedoms.	29
1	College... It's basically thought of as a requirement, when it isn't. Mcdonalds requiring a 2 year degree or something... Did you hear about that?   What about some courses about plots in movies?   Or gender studies...  College is now catering to people who are dumb. They take out student loans and become forever in debt without a guaranteed job once they finish.  Fuck college.	29

0	I can understand men maintaining facial hair, because women also do (typically it gets waxed), but do you consider a man lazy if he doesn't shave his legs as well?  I'm sure you're not trying to hold a double standard, I'd appreciate your clarifying that point.  Here's my bias, and I'm open to your changing my mind: Women typically already spend around double the money and time on their appearance (makeup, shaving, sometimes nails, sometimes long hair, etc), and I have a hard time seeing how choosing to do an equal amount of work as her male counterpart is lazy.	29

0	&gt;But since you likened eating meat to the holocaust in a previous comment, I'm going to assume you're barking fucking mad.  Multiple people who have *lived through the holocaust* have made this comparison. Are they also fucking mad?   Do you really know better than they do?	29
0	I'm kinda confused what makes this a SJW thing.	29
1	Yeah, this school is at the top of the list for SJW indoctrination.	29
1	I feel the same way. SJW nonsense goes beyond political ideologies.  That kind of nonsense is not left or right wing.  Far right wing Christians have acted like it a lot. Powerful radical groups of any kind act as if any disagreement is offensive and therefore should be stopped. Not just SJW types.	29

1	The one in ten thousand biological abnormality does not invalidate the male-female dichotomy for the rest of the species.   And mental illness does not change biological fact. However, catering to it doesn't treat the mental illness while creating confusion for other kids. We properly treat Body integrity identity disorder, where people want to cut off arms and legs, but when someone says it is a sexual organ, OK, hormones and stereotypical clothing and surgical alteration for you.	29

0	&gt;  In this conception, social justice is not related to one's identity, but socio-economic status.   Class war, not ethnopluralism. Got it.  &gt; SJWs use a definition which is based on identity, rather than socio-economic status.  Telling, isn't it.	29

0	I love you guys. It's threads like this that makes me think KIA members would be right at home at /r/theredpill, namely because you're enlightened of how society really is and see through the bullshit feminists/SJWs try to promote. /r/KotakuInAction is another crowd that gets it.  For those who haven't seen it yet, this may be of interest:  https://exposingfeminism.wordpress.com/shaming-tactics/  Seems like every single SJW "argument" was lifted from this page. In reality whoever wrote it is just really familiar with thier modus operandi.	29

1	I'll say it again, the left wing liberals are the biggest threat to free speech. This is what happens when Liberals have some form of power, they keep censoring and censoring and begin to slowly chip away at free speech, if they get any real power it'll be a hate crime to criticise.	29
1	The best part is you know they feel so smug and powerful when they ban someone.  How pathetic can one life be?	29

0	Read the interview. He is not advocating for that. Specifically, he wanted to investigate "Why are families a good thing, exactly". Quoting everything here would be too long so I won't do it. Link is in the article. At most, he says that parents who read to their kids should think "ocassionally" how they are disadvantaging other people kids, but that is as bad as it gets. He doesn't even say that they should stop.	29
0	i'm not interested in arguing with you about that  the point is there is a faction on the right which uses threats and boycotts and public shaming and so on to get its way and suppress its opponents.   its the exact same idea as sjws... and the right is a lot more powerful and dangerous.  if the sjw's had anything like the same power being transgender would be compulsory in half the states.	29

0	It's actually a case of gun owners adopting SJW tactics. Calling people who don't agree with you 'phobes'.  &gt; SJWs are on a path to ban gun ownership.   That'd be the first useful thing they've ever done, then. You and I will never agree, so let's leave it there.	29

1	Social justice is a concept that originated from within the liberal tradition (think Rawls here). Liberalism emphasizes individualism--that it is the individual person whose feelings and general well-being must be protected or advanced beyond that of groups, organizations, traditions, nature, etc.  Social justice warriorness is liberalism taken to the irrational extreme, where the natural variation of the world is blindly misunderstood in the name of justice. SJW hate can come from anyone, but it's no surprise that those who identify liberalism's shortcomings will be more vocal.	29

0	Fair skin=white.  His skin IS white, therefore he is white.  He is not black, he is not hispanic, he is not Asian.  Why do we see news sources calling Zimmerman white, when he's clearly Hispanic, but this man is suddenly a "Jew race" when his skin is CLEARLY caucasian.	29
1	What can you do when you are outnumbered 100 to 2? Not much. You could be brave and ask the professor about what white male privileges you have in this class and if you can have your A and move on to things that matter.	29
