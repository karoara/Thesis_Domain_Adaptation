The kind of divestment actually required is moving away from needing quite so much fossil fuel energy in your life.  If you sell all your stock in Exxon, feel smug about yourself, and then continue driving around in a petrol driven car then the only thing you have changed is the makeup of your investment portfolio.	0
0	Did you even read it?  This is mostly about fertilizers.  &gt;Making full use of crop residues as forage for cattle, collecting and composting cattle manure, and replacing part of the chemical fertilizer input with organic manure have been successfully shown to be ideal choices to reduce energy waste and cut GHG emissions without crop yield losses  So using a more natural approach combined with chemical fertilizers.  So not completely replacing chemicals but using integrated methods.  As to your points.  1. So?  2. Mostly about fertilizers, but any farmer putting the effort to do something other than spray chemicals for everything would probably reduce pesticide use.  3.  They never suggested that.	0

1	The justice department is responsible for policing the financial markets and is responsible for enforcing regulations. The Bush administration was famously lax in that regard.  [The Credit Crisis: The Bush Administration's Record of Denial and Regulatory Neglect](http://www.dpc.senate.gov/dpcdoc.cfm?doc_name=fs-110-2-171)  It was the height of irresponsibility to simply allow Leman brothers to collapse. That is what set the dominos tumbling and the reason we had to institute a 800 billion dollar bailout. If Bush would have stepped in, nationalized Leman Bros, and examined the large banks there would not have *been* a crash.  Yeah...it was the Bush administration's fault!	1

0	Enormous political will?!?!?!? How about politicians stop being fucking assholes.  What's so hard about that?	1
1	Well, for starters a fringe candidate usually has no chance of winning the general election. As a progressive, I love Bernie Sanders but for American politics he is far left of center. In fact, he is the MOST liberal senator in our country (data below).  On the liberal to conservative scale, Hillary ranks 11. Bernie Sanders ranks 1, Obama ranked 23 and Coburn ranks 101.  http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/31/1374629/-Hillary-Clinton-Was-the-11th-Most-Liberal-Member-of-the-Senate  To win the general election, you have to appeal to the most people, which is usually achieved by being centrist. Therefore, it is very unlikely to see a winner who is on the extreme of either ideology.	1
1	Not necessarily inflationary. it's still the same amount of money injected into the system . It would just simply have gone to the real estate market rather than the military industrial complex. It definitely would have inflated house prices. Without the war we wouldn't need a lot of soldiers, so rather than going into the military all those young men would have gone into the construction trades building all those houses. Of course belying this entire argument is that our housing market was already over inflated and collapsed. So obviously we didn't need that many houses in the first place. A better example would have been some sort of industry. Free education and healthcare perhaps?	1

1	I'm sure we're all here intimately familiar with FPTP voting at this point. That is a huge roadblock, no question, but that doesn't change the reality that this is exactly the fear leveraged by the two parties to retain power and ignore the desires of the electorate. At the risk of accelerationism, nothing's going to change if we're not willing to take meaningful risks and accept difficult sacrifices. *Every* presidential election has carried the threat of loathsome Supreme Court nominees used to compel votes for an otherwise unacceptable platform. It is the DNC's job to build a platform and select candidates that attract my vote.	1

Obama championed a lot of important progress for the country even if I don't agree with all of his positions (particularly war issues).  I suspect Hillary would be similar.

1	Politics is dirty as all hell. There is plenty of opportunity to fight like a politician, and knowing Bernie's ample history, I would not be surprised if he understands that.   That said, this goes beyond mere campaigning challenges. This is the core principle of his platform - not to represent the interests of the billionaire donors who manipulate politics, but rather embrace the interest of the public.   That is the very essence of what his ideology and function is.   If I had a decision on how to run presidential elections, I'd give all candidates $200K after collecting enough signatures to qualify for campaign funds.	1

1	This is always the thing that gets me about the "min. wage retail/food service jobs aren't meant for working adults" argument.  It's so damn hard to get OUT of a minimum wage job, if only because the skills you earn aren't often very useful in the higher-paying white collar or blue-collar worlds.

If our society cannot produce voters with enough sense in their head to make an informed decision, then our country has wrought what it sowed.

1	Bernie is a great alternative, dude. Warren is about a decade younger, so she has more time to be in the Senate and to then run for POTUS, if that interests her. At the moment, she's not interested at all. She's said so herself *many* times. Best thing you can do to get a country that Warren envisions? If your state has closed primaries, register as a Democrat, and then in the primaries vote for Bernie. He's our best shot.	1
0	&gt;&gt; they come in and take your factory.  &gt;Yeah, I'm thinking the person(s) who invested all of their time and money and life to building that factory might see a problem with that approach.   Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, John D Rockefeller, Henry Ford, Louis Chevrolet, Ray Kroc, John Queeney, Alexander Graham Bell, Frederick Koch and a plethora of other dead guys are gonna be pissed about losing their "factories".	1

1	&gt;In some right-wing circles, however, “Jade Helm 15” is the basis for an extraordinary conspiracy theory. The idea gets a little convoluted – fringe theories often are – but the unhinged activist apparently believe the Obama administration, in conjunction with the U.S. military and Wal-Mart, is planning to impose martial law on much of the country. As they see it, the plan also includes gun confiscation and “secret underground tunnels.”  Wow, just wow! And they think Walmart is in on this grand conspiracy?	1
0	The fact that his family owns the home.	1
1	&gt; They create more jobs and more intellectual capital  How does defunding research create "intellectual capital?"  Much less jobs.	1
1	And the Fall of Man. Can't forget how he offered health insurance to Adam.	1

0	I wonder how long this circlejerk can continue.	1
0	rich white folks, poor white trash gets the boots too	1
1	I don't know about you, but I get the sense that these investigations take so long and the findings kept secret because all of those involved are wracking their brains desperately trying to come up with a scenerio where the officers can be shown to be not guilty of any wrong doing. This in contrast to them trying for the exact opposite when investigating an ordinary citizen.	1
1	Right? Isn't that fucky?	1

1	Well, if you look at Warren and Clinton's voting records and positions they are very similar on most issues.   Yes Clinton has raised a lot of money from Wall Street, but so will any eventual nominee for the R or D in the general election. Obama started his campaign saying he wouldn't accept those big donations, but changed his tune once he realized he needed them to win.  EDITED to better answer your question.	1
1	so basically its all about selfishness (and greed).	1
0	&gt;I have an M.S. In mathematics. Logic is my strong point.  Some guy on the Internet who can't understand the difference between engineering and general research, and thinks an engine designed to operate in a wide variety of environments can't handle a slight change in average conditions over decades, is telling me he has an M.S. in mathematics.	1
1	Well it's probably because of how poorly he handled Katrina.	1
1	No, candidates raising money from billionaires who donate to anonymous super pacs is something to sneer at.   Raising money by appealing to voters is pretty much exactly how elections should be run assuming there isn't public campaign financing.	1
0	Rationale?  You are the clown defending Rolling Stone in the face of  the UVA, Will Dana and Sabrina Rubin Erdely debacle.

0	Not at all.  Where are these liberal utopias that have tax rates as low?  Especially on the middle and upper middle class.	1
0	&gt;He's less liberal than FDR.  Well, no, he's not.  FDR wasn't particularly weak on defense, for one.  Regardless, "less liberal than FDR" isn't a huge hurdle, and even if it were true, it doesn't preclude "but still way too liberal" from being an option.	1
0	I've written lengthy posts about this in response to people who asked me the same question you did. You chose to not read them and instead ask me the same question that I already answered.	1
0	I think one of us is interpreting something wrong.... I agree that Hillary definitely accepted bribes, but she will never face charges.  I probably missed some sarcasm somewhere.	1
0	Quite frankly I hate the comparison to Ron Paul. While they have one thing in common: the fact they are honest, when it comes to the issues they are vastly different. I could never have supported Ron Paul and it genuinely worries me that people are already comparing Sanders to him when they're worlds apart.  And that word: "Presidential"? What's it even supposed to mean? Not rich enough? Lacks a careful presentation dictated by opinion polls?	1
1	&gt;Republicans love service members except when they're home.	1
0	Oh Christ.  Truth and honesty change the world.  Bumper sticker pablum and shared lies do not.	1
1	I'm glad others think the same exact way (first time donating, probably going to volunteer).  Hell, I may push my organization to try and put on event to help high school/college students to register to vote (not support a certain candidate, but just to get them to vote).	1
0	The point about the course of events seems to be that a Terry stop never happened, because Gray ran away. I don't know the relevant laws in Maryland, but running away from police is considered to be obstruction of justice in most states, which would again be a reason for arrest.	1
0	It's funny how the right is aligned with the Christians' position and the left is aligned with the Satanists' position. Very appropriate.. I think.	1

1	That's what they're trying to point out. Laws that are created or exempted because of religion have no business being laws. It's 2015 and the US has citizens of all faiths. So to favor one is discriminatory.	1

1	We don't often see a reasonable, compassionate, level-headed and most of all not bought-out American presidential candidate.

1	Its hard for a Dr to make more than $10k a week at those rates.	1

1	It seems to me that Chomsky addressed every question posed by Harris. He outlined the reasons why he believes Clinton's motivations for the Al-Shifa attack are immoral (reckless retaliation without regard for human life), why he doesn't think the professed intentions of world leaders are meaningful, and why he refuses to engage Sam in a public debate. Just because Chomsky comes off as accusatory doesn't mean that his remarks should be ignored.	1
0	Well, I am sorry for expecting more than mindless hero-worship of politicians from Reddit.  I come here for substantive discussions, *not*:  "Oh, hes dreamy!"  "I love him ever so much!"  "Everyone loves him and you will too!"  "EEEK! BERNIE SANDERS!"	1

0	It's not just an overseas/domestic dichtomy. Laying off of economic espionage would make EU countries much more likely to cooperate on security. Also, following the legal process and prosecuting terrorists, instead of disappearing them would be helpful.  full disclosure: Am EU citizen.	1

1	They're not upset when Christians are defensive. they're delighted.	1
0	It is not on-topic. Internships at a foundation are not political, whether paid or unpaid.  We have allowed many other submissions that talk about the foreign money going to Hillary. This isn't bias, it's application of the rules.	1
0	TLDR: He is a self described socialist.	1
0	Get Annoyed, Emotion-counter!	1
0	&gt;First, Sanders is liberal, and can sincerely sell a liberal vision to Democratic primary voters. Unlike Martin O’Malley, whose past public statements qualify as “moderate” according to OnTheIssues.org, Sanders is a “hardcore liberal.” On a standardized scale of -100 to 100 (with -100 being the most conservative and 100 being the most liberal), **Sanders hits 54**; O’Malley’s only a 25. **Clinton is a 53**.  That is some buuulllllshhit	1

1	Do you also oppose laws against theft, arson and murder?  What if I make my free decision to rob you, kill you, and set everything you've ever cared about on fire?  What about if I make the free decision to open an online store, save customer's credit card numbers, and then steal everything they own?  I mean they knew the risks giving someone that information, right?	1
0	He didn't say anything about shutting down the NSA. Just dismantling the spying program. The NSA does more than spy on us.	1
0	I'm just ruling out you saying "what if the majority of Vermont residents wanted to kill all Muslims"	1
1	How is illegally arresting/false imprisonment different than kidnapping/abduction? (I am curious about the legal differences, not suggesting they are the same) It is my understanding that and death caused by the latter is always charged as 1st degree murder, even if it is an accident or caused by the victim.   Edit: clarification	1
1	It means he has much larger voter support from the tens of thousands of people who believe his campaign is worth donating to. Compare this to the 10 to 100 votes that can be counted upon by the other candidates from their few rich donors.  Money does not win the presidency votes do.	1
1	If they were blind, they wouldnt know he was black.	1
0	Which corporations, specifically, are seeing the drafts?   Also, the USTR is made up of representives, economists, industry folks, ambassadors, etc. It's not just our corporate llizard overlords.	1
1	Agreed.  I remember Ross Perot and Ralph Nader.  I jumped hard on the Obama train in his first election.  I really believed he was going to be a real game changer.  Eh..he hasn't been a bad president but the bill of goods sold was certainly not delivered.     I'll vote for Bernie in the general if given the opportunity though.  Oh sweet naivete...how I miss thee.	1
1	Not since Ross Perot and Ralph Nader have I given a presidential candidate this much money before. Even if he loses, I want his ideas spread so other candidates and our country at least discuss them.	1

1	I didn't know Bernie Sanders was a woman.	1
1	&gt; Many police "abuses" only seem that way because people conveniently forget all about what the so-called "victim" did prior in order to attract the police attention.  What was Gray's crime, again?	1

0	Big government control over everything about your life and Redistribution of wealth. Elitist Collectivism.	1
0	Aw. Without that money he has no chance to win. :(  I know we all wish it wouldn't be the case, but it is. If I were him I'd take the money and once elected say "Fuck all ya, I'll do what I want."	1
0	And I'd think there must be more than a few trust-worthy Canadian-Americans who could set up a paetron or something and just *randomly* decide to donate all money from foreign donations toward this politician.	1

(Tell yer Buddy Ted Cruz I said hello while yer there)  In the meantime:  **Clinton Foundation Expenses**  * 88.4% - Programs  * 7% - Management and General Expenses  * 4.6% - Fundraising   BTW - Their accounting is done by Pricewaterhouse Coopers and then audited by BKD.  Two of the largest accounting firms in the US.  But who are you going to believe?	1

0	I'm not saying you're a bad or weak person.  I'm saying that unless you are the one in the line of fire, you don't get to self-aggrandize with the nobility of your stance.	1
1	There is no way that you can say lower wages are not beneficial to employers. That makes literally no sense.    So the claim I think you're making is that public assistance does not put downward pressure on pay. That may be true, but the resolution, to raise minimum wage, would clearly address public assistance needs AND would cause employers to pay more.    Do you think employers want to pay more now, and, if so, why are that not?	1
0	&gt; A major reason for many to call themselves libertarian is to distance themselves from the GOP.  To distance themselves from the social conservatives and the religious right, and some will identify libertarian to distance themselves from the Democrats' nanny state tendencies.  It's a whole lot easier for someone to just be an independent and it'll allow you to freely criticize both parties on any of the issues, including on the subjects and party platform policies which are usually off-limits to criticism.	1
1	that may have something to do with sanders knowing basic economics, history, and political science, unlike paul?  Its funny how people who spend there life reporting and studying politics hate a guy who says things that are untrue or make no sense in their field, huh?	1
0	Well if this kid was working and perusing non-destructive hobbies he would be alive. Instead he chose to go gang-banging and dealing drugs. The police are no better, trigger happy and clearly racists. So why was this kid, and so many others, happy to give the corrupt police a reason to screw them?	1
0	That's precisely why Democrats don't want to fix it.  They know that it essentially gives them de facto amnesty.  They expand the government and expand their voter rolls.  Win-win.	1
1	&gt; It's not a civil contract because it binds third parties. The interesting guarantees of marriage - visitation rights, shared insurance, heritability of benefits - cannot be recreated with the unlimited right to contract.  Nor can things like ease of immigration, not being forced to testify against a spouse, different taxation, etc.	1
0	Please be civil. This is a warning.	1

0	Amen!  How cool would it be (not that this would be likely to happen) if they formed a secret alliance to nominate one another for Vice President.  Paul/Sanders, Sanders/Paul.  I'd love it.	1
0	The crushingly depressing realities of our world are a result of everyone behaving like you.  If everyone behaved like me, on the other hand, they wouldn't *dare* not make Bernie Sanders the Dem nominee.  And we'd have a president Dennis Kucinich in the WH, not Bush III.	1

1	I live in the high tax and rapidly growing Minnesota.  We have a budget surplus over $1 billion USD.  The governor raised the minimum wage.

1	Compared to the rest of the world? Yeah.	1
1	They will continue to do so because they have political sway derivative from application of those profits and there is insufficient political will to change the system.  The ACA was an incredibly benign bit of legislation and the Republicans raised holy hell.  Moving to a straight single payer model will be a herculean political feat.	1
0	Because you will hurt the cause you are hoping to support.  If you want a campaign like this to actually make a difference you have to give a rat's ass about logic.  You owe it to him to be effective.	1
1	Can he actually win against the republican candidate, though?   That's my fear. He manages to beat Hilary, and then loses the presidency.	1
0	Is it bad that I'd guess more than half the voting population has no idea what Orwellian means?	1

A little research was in order - Representative Todd Smith "retired" after being defeated in the Texas senate election in 2012. He opposed discriminatory voter ID. Kelly Hancock, who won, is a "true conservative", elected by those same idiots.	1

0	If any Democrat were serious about the decline of the middle class and lack of employment opportunities in black hotspots like Ferguson and Baltimore, she (or he) would immediately call for a cessation of legal and illegal immigration, which is the primary cause of the decline in opportunity for Americans and the death of the American dream. But immigrants vote Democratic. Rigging elections through demographic change brought about through immigration is worse than being bought by billionaires.	1

0	You're right.   Hey everyone, Hillary's husband is a mass-murderer who starved **FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN TO DEATH** trying to conquer Iraq for the Empire.  She should be COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE to you.  Voting for her is literally worse than voting even for someone like David Duke.   Remember, voting for mass-murdering imperialist warmongers is BAD and WRONG. If you do it you're a BAD person and you should feel BAD.	1

1	Cause college tuition could never create an bubble	1
1	I would challenge anyone who believes that the voter should not know who is paying for "electioneering" ads to tell me why.   People certainly have not been intimidated - unless you are a troll and are going to argue that you are afraid to address an issue via a sane discussion.   The KOCHs have admitted that they are willing to spend millions to affect the outcome of the elections - the whine is hilarious, because the ignorance is that we don't know Immediately, but do know, after the election.    How is that speed relative to "freedom of speech".	1

1	What makes it even funnier is how *popular* the most-vetoey president if it's FDR.  He got elected **four** times. No one else had ever done that (and yes, there were ones that wanted a third term).	1
1	Sadly I think Hillary will win because of the whole "first female president!!!" gimmick.	1
0	&gt;The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman’s right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy, including a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay. We oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right. Abortion is an intensely personal decision between a woman, her family, her doctor, and her clergy; there is no place for politicians or government to get in the way.	1
0	&gt;But if the labor still isn't worth it, then the job goes away. It should. However that has never happened.   Really?  No job in the history of mankind has ever gone away because of the price of labor?  Every possible labor application that has ever had a human doing it still exists?  I'm going to have to ask for proof on that one.	1

0	With your help! Now is that hard to understand.  You are the third to send me mail today, you are so lucky. Try sending some to your Representative and Senator, State and Federal!  This is called support.  I out that your party leaders will be impressed, unless you donate a few thousand.	1
1	He's running as a democrat	1
1	I agreed with some of the authors sentiments in the article. However thinking Michael Browns strong armed robbery of a convenience store right before his fatal encounter with the police office shouldn't be part of the conversation is ridiculous.  Stating things were calming down before the Brown video was released is laughable and a pathetic effort to blame others for inexcusable behavior.	1
0	Well the american voting system is screwed also. My last time voting they asked me which group. I told them independent and I got a confused look, then I get my ballot and a lot of items were taken off, so I couldn't vote for either candidate. I live in Georgia which is fucked in a lot of ways. [Private probation companies]( https://youtu.be/0UjpmT5noto)	1

1	They usually do. Satanists don't really care that their literature is distributed or their goat statues placed at courthouses. They want Christians to see that doing similar things for their religion can be just as offensive to others. Likewise, they don't generally think religion should be used to influence or carve out exceptions to broadly applicable laws. But as long as Christians feel the need to do, they will attempt to show them how offensive that seems to outgroups.	1
1	This guy is hilariously stupid to the point where I can't even hate him anymore. Watching him speak is entertaining (unlike Scott Walker, who genuinely scares me).	1
0	That seems like a vast overstatement...  There might be a few domestic advantages, but he would be hamstrung by the right-wing congress (including the center-right party of which he would technically be the head) to the point where nothing which was truly significant would change.	1
0	Very unironically. The "Right" seeks to anchor our future to the outdated ideologies of postwar (WWII) America and their only solution is to incite new wars and exploit humanity's desire to murder itself based on archaic belief systems (and profit from it!).   Don't allow internal conflicts to fracture the base. Stand together and generate dialogue and civil debate between like minded individuals who perhaps disagree on certain issues.   Let the "right" wallow in their own bullshit.	1
1	&gt; Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox has procured a 5 per cent stake in Vice Media for $70m (£45m).  yes, But  &gt;Vice’s own senior management still controls some 75 per cent of the company. That, Mr Smith added, “gives us the freedom to do what we want to do”.	1
0	Pretty sure that statements like "I think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people" would lock up the GOP nomination for Mother Teresa.	1
0	My employer can't afford to give their employees all a 14% raise, and would likely lose significant business if they raised prices to cover the shortfall.  The result would be people getting laid off.	1
0	If anyone knows the pulse of the astro-surfing sock-puppets of reddit politice, one would realize that Bernie is another shill.   One positive mention of U.S. Air Force Captain (and former 22 term Congressman) OBGYN Dr. Ron Paul (3 time presidential candidate), and you get down-voted to oblivion.    Senator Bernie Sanders (multiple term political figure) gets mentioned, and it makes the front page.  **Your** masters are hiding behind the internet.	1
0	I never claimed that the Democrats intend to overturn Roe v Wade. They wrap themselves in Roe v Wade while seeking to go much further. I think I'm being pretty reasonable here.   Planned Parenthood is an extreme organization led by someone who is in favor of elective late term abortion, and its founder Margaret Sanger was even more extreme.   Abortion's simply not going away as an issue. Not in either of our lifetimes. Gay marriage can mostly go away, if both sides can respect each other's right to disagree. Even that will never fully go away as an issue.	1
1	I wouldn't be surprised if Monday night Jon Stewart apologizes for that.  I think he's probably gotten a lot of messages from Bernie supporters explaining how that line made him part of the problem.  Granted, I think his intention was right on in that he was trying to communicate that without big money, it's damned hard to win elections in this country.	1
1	&gt;“Imagine this. Just imagine this,” the Congressman said. “Barack Obama goes down as the president who vetoed the most bills and in the succeeding election cost his party another election.”  He's also way off base about vetoes:  [here's a link to presidential veto counts.  President Obama has so far vetoed 4 bills](http://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/vetoCounts.htm)	1

0	Good thing he doesnt have a chance. Say what you want but an admitted socialist has no place in american politics.	1
0	Yes, but I don't think at the same scale and not really in /r/politics although during election season you'll see it.  The Democrats seem to understand this better and play the game all the time.	1
1	Don't compromise out of fear &amp; two-party brainwashing.  If Sanders deserves your vote, give it to him, regardless of primary outcomes.	1
0	Uh, he's saying stuff to get elected. And when he does, he goes back on his promises. There.	1
1	A big problem is middle-class flight, when neighborhoods start to lose jobs, or rise in crime, those with the means (usually white people) leave and go elsewhere.	1
0	He has no chance of winning the nomination, and these Buzzfeed top 6 lists do nothing but give false hope to the pot-smoking teens of Reddit.	1
0	It's cute how you think Sanders has a chance.	1
1	And what effect do you think moving them to more of a salaried/bonus situation and less of being slaves to the insurance industry would have?  I have heard more than one doctor complain one of the worst part of the job is having to do what insurance will allow/pay for rather than what he thinks is right for the patient.   And I don't remember most general practitioners being massively overworked until HMOs started becoming the way of medical care in the U.S. which forced them to shuffle patients through like cattle.	1
1	There is nothing to stop him from taking the money and then doing nothing for them once he wins. That only matters to politicians who care about being reelected. It would make him seem like he might though which his goes against his image.	1
1	I'm British and I'm more excited for American politics than our own thanks to Bernie Sanders.  The main quote to take away from that interview was, "If the banks are too big to fail, they're too big to exist".  Excellent stuff.	1
1	Just because he won't endorse or support a billionaire's Super PAC donation for his campaign doesn't mean it can't happen anyway without his approval. PACs are independent of his campaign and anyone has the ability to donate.	1
0	No person smart enough to make billions of dollars would give Bernie money.	1

1	i don't have time to read through the whole thing. do you mind quoting the pertinent info that got you to the 13.4%?	1
1	"Meme" originally referred to any concept or belief which can spread through a society. "Bernie Sanders is worthy of my volunteer work" is a meme, which supporters should try to make as virulent as possible.	1

I refuse to see how you show that the police are racist at looking at black people as criminals, by being black and looting and destroying.    I know your white guilt is strong, but black people can be assholes too, and in a community that is 60% black, that means that of the 20% of people that are going to loot and destroy, the majority will be black.	1

Their is no independence under socialism. Socialism is about putting power into the hands of a few. Our founders set up a government that was designed to keep power spread thin. Power is dangerous. I consumes individuals with too much of it. Those in leadership positions have turned American children away from God. They have chosen to make US enemies of righteousness.	1

0	Renewables.  Got it.  Exactly what I expected.  If they were economically viable, they wouldn't be "alternative".  They also kill more people than nuclear.  You seem to prefer the idea of powering the world on unicorns tears, though, so don't let those pesky facts get in the way of your preconceived notions and idealism.  For the record, I am a renewable proponent.  But the tech and manufacturing aren't there yet.  Nuclear is 100% necessary *now*.	1
0	I guess no need for a trial since you've already deemed them guilty. So much for "innocent"until proven guilty.	1
1	I'm voting entirely on the basis of two issues in the next election cycle:  1. Protecting civil liberties by ending domestic spying  1. Remove the corrupting influence of money through campaign finance reform.  Mr. Sanders, you've got my vote.	1
1	&gt; Most of the discussion on the right has been about failed Democratic policies in these cities for the last 50 years.   Yes, as a cudgel to slam Democrats.  Now I'd be willing to accept that if they had a solution. They have a solution, right?	1
0	After seeing this blatant injustice, we obviously need equal pay for equal work legislation for men.	1
0	This is really great to see another post from here at the top again. I really hope we as a community can keep a Bernie Sanders related post at the top of ALL for months to come.	1
1	Because he has been lauded as "unelectable" yet in day one he raised more money than his republican counterparts. The PEOPLE want Bernie, the average donation was $45 and I'm proud to say I put in double that. Let's keep it up and get the man the funds he needs to win this.	1
1	He has a mixed gun record. Wants to ban ar15s and clips with more than 10 rounds in it. That is where most people on reddit will have a problem.	1
1	There's a difference between a difficult sacrifice and knowingly fucking yourself.  The next president is going to be responsible for several Supreme Court appointments, and the Republican Party is at an all-time low in terms of having trustworthy candidates.  I'd rather see Sanders than Clinton, sure, but I'd rather see Clinton than any Republican candidate that's been floated so far.	1
0	The key here is sustaining the momentum. He's not an attention whore and he doesn't go around simply saying stuff that people want to hear. That'll make it tougher for him to get publicity.   Spreading his message is one of the biggest things his supporters can do over the next few months.	1
1	You cannot sell your integrity to 30,000 people who each donate $50, but you can sell your integrity to 1 guy/company that donates millions. Unfortunately that's how the system in US works politicians need money to campaign.	1
1	To be fair, that money doesn't disappear. A large part of it is returned to the economy because it is spent on US Defense contractors, military pay, etc...  With that said, I think that our choice to partake in a virtually continuous war in the middle east has been terrible for both our country economically and the regions stability.	1
1	Ah I see. So the question then becomes how likely do you think it is that a major politician who is fairly well-respected would attempt a lie of that sort when it could very easily backfire and when they are in a few months going to have to actually release all the actual data anyways which would show if they had lied? You seem to be underestimating by a lot how much paperwork and filing is involved in running federal level campaigns and how much Sanders would have to lose in this context.	1
0	Don't worry, the judge will still find a way to throw out the case. Can't have them blackies thinking they can get justice /s	1
1	Can we just perpetually keep Bernie Sanders posts at the top of Reddit for the next year and half? This is not the false prophet that Obama was. Sanders has much stronger words than Obama had when he was running, and the voting history to back it up. He's also an independent running on the Democratic ticket, not a true Dem. This is our man! I'm going to volunteer for a presidential campaign for the first time ever, I have so much faith in this guy (Is it faith if it's based on evidence?)	1
0	As a modded you own nothing. You are using someone else's IP. You shouldn't be able to earn money. It's no different than what Jroc did on his rap albums.	1

1	Me too. Can't wait to caucus up :)	1
1	That was exactly how the establishment destroyed him - by smearing him and getting all the mindless sheep follow their lead.  Ross Perot received death threats, and the mindless sheep didn't care.  Bernie Sanders will also get smeared and defamed, and again the mindless sheep will be there to support the establishment.	1
1	Yeah, but this is utterly insane.	1
1	What blows my mind is that Christians didn't always (and not all do now) view the world through such an infantile lens.  Many great philosophers and scientists of the old world were Christians trying to reconcile the lessons of the Bible with the observable truth of the world around them.  Recently, that's been turned on it's head, and now they just deny the world around them and insist that ALL truth lay in the ramblings of a bunch of iron age nomads.	1
1	And this is how you stop this type of shit from happening in the future.  It may end in an acquittals but it forces the cops to be held accountable for their actions and will hopefully stop this bullshit	1

0	dear canada,  no thanks.	1
0	You seem to miss that Clinton being a woman is almost a shoe in for the vote.  She will beat Sanders as he alienates a lot of the more conservative left.  A lot of america is center mass, like Obama and Clinton.    I completely agree with you, though as of late there is a loft of Dems calling out other Dems for not being progressive enough.  This inner party squabbling is only going to hurt the party long term.	1

1	Taxation boils down to one simple thing ---- it can spur an economy by spending money that others don't want to let go.  If people paying more are job creators, that means they have businesses and will see this money return to them if they are doing right.  In a sense this IS capitalism, just with a little nudge.	1

1	Why? You can easily google it.  "Hillary is terrific," she said when asked again if she would endorse her in the event Clinton makes a run for the Democratic nomination.  I'm not sure why Reddit thinks that Hillary is so conservative. She doesn't say she will do conservative things. And her record does not show her doing conservative things.  On the liberal to conservative scale, Hillary ranks 11. Bernie Sanders ranks 1, and Coburn ranks 101. Hillary is FAR from a Republican. http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/31/1374629/-Hillary-Clinton-Was-the-11th-Most-Liberal-Member-of-the-Senate  EDIT: Just reread my original comment.

0	&gt;Bernie Sanders' track record on civil liberties is impeccable.  It's not impeccable.  He wants to ban the sale of the most popular rifle in the United States, and impose criminal restrictions on ergonomic and safety features on guns (like pistol grips and barrel shrouds).	1
0	Yeah the government should really step in and protect the most vulnerable among us from parents who are intent on ushering them toward death.   We should be doing all we can to save lives rather than letting parents end them based on their personal feelings.   Except abortion though,  in that case we don't care about that life.	1

1	What an incredibly poignant response.	1
1	&gt; I just hope the liberal vote isn't split  That's the whole reason to run as a Democrat. It avoids splitting the liberal vote in the general election.	1
0	But this still means nothing, honey. I'm sorry but this is just hot air. Nearly ANY politician will say keep jobs in America and strengthen the middle class. Lots of the Democratic Party and some republicans are criticizing the TPP, which is what I assume you mean by your choice of the words free trade. You can read more and present points with substance, and actually sway people in your direction instead of just saying "oh this guy is just really amazingly good and handsome."	1
1	Regardless what you think of the media. Sanders getting elected is actually a very long shot. So don't get tied up hating the messenger and ignore the message.   Okay so what do we do if we accept the truth of the message. There are 2 responses. Get discouraged and give up. Or keep your focus realistic and redouble your effort. I would like to see a Sanders presidency as much as anyone here I suspect. But the reason he doesn't stand a chance isn't just because the media says so. Don't rove yourself in to loosing.	1

0	&gt;  Now tell me about how Abe Lincoln was the most racist man of the 19th century.   Well, he wasn't *not* racist, if that's what you're asking. I certainly wouldn't support your claim that he was most racist though, that's as silly as you calling Obama literally Hitler.    You're a little heavy on the hyperbole, is all.	1
1	As a health insurance sales agent for the better part of a year I agree that single payer is the best way to go.  Simple. Insurance works to minimize loss to an individual by spreading the risk among premium payers. The bigger the pool the less the premium payment so it doesn't make sense from an effeciency standpoint to have small separate pools. One big pool for all will be the best.	1
1	He has repeatedly spoken out against the TPP.  A trade deal that would give corporations a lot more leeway to fuck people over with the power to sue anyone who tries to reign in their abuse.	1
0	The reason he wants to avoid negative attacks is because Hillary will win the primary and doesn't need unnecessary attacks on her that would damage sanders relationship to the dem party.	1
0	it's not clear that bernie will either. obama pledged to do plenty of things that he pulled a total 180 on. (and before someone cites republicans in congress, republicans didn't make president obama refuse to call the amernian genocide "genocide" like candidate obama promised to).  people should be weary of a candidate who has lots of sounds bytes but very little in the way of actual legislative accomplishments.	1

0	As a liberal, It's because she has proven that she doesn't align with almost any of my views. Hillary is just another Obama and although they may seem better than the insane republicans they throw out, they still serve the same people.

0	The fact is that Hillary has broken no laws, nor has she even acted suspiciously. You can cry all you want about the Clinton Foundation, but they are about as pored over as any institution ever and *they are a charitable organization.*  You really must be scared of this strong woman. Personally, I don't like her personality, but she's miles above any of the GOP candidates. I am in the bag for Bernie and if/when he's primaried out, I will probably switch to Jill Stein...  But it's interesting that this early on in the race the GOP shills are already grasping at straws because their candidates are so lackluster.	1

Break a law quietly in your own home, one many of the police officers themselves are willing to break, and you're not in much danger.  If you were to poll most people I know on how much data they'd pirated over the years their answer would be in terrabytes.  And I bet that number decreased with the invention of Netflix. I used to pirate movies all the time, now I Netflix.  We literally moved the market via theft. We changed an industry via crime.	1

The point is that when you don't **pay** for an intern to do work, they must make due by other means, which is usually the bank of mom and dad (and no, the $2,000 need based stipend will not cover 4 months in NYC... the very fact that there is a "need based stipend" speaks volumes to the types of folks who are able to apply!)	1

0	Reagan was practically moderate.   Just to name a few things he gave actual amnesty to 3 million illegal aliens.  Federal spending also ballooned under him.  He raised taxes 7 out of the eight years he was in office.  The only reason he is considered the right-wing national treasure is because he is one of the few Republican presidents whose semi-right-wing policies didn't completely fuck up the country.  But that's not entirely true.  Unemployment was higher under him than during the most recent recession and its effects lasted longer too.  There's also Iran Contra, the Taliban and bunch of other bullshit as well.	1

0	That's all that will happen here as well. There isn't a shred of evidence to support any of these charges. At the very least there is enough reasonable doubt to make this case completely unwinnable at trial. They clearly charged so many individuals in the hope of getting some of them to testify against the others in exchange for having their charges dropped. So long as the cops stick together none of them will spend another day in jail. It's only if they start backstabbing each other that any of these charges might stick.	1

0	Yeah that's totally absurd.   Anyone who knows anything about finance knows it was Clinton's fault.   Although, Obama *did* pick Larry Summers as his chief econ adviser. The Clinton admin economists who are responsible for the collateralized debt obligation-credit default swap bubble that led to the 2008 crash are Robert Rubin and his mini-me, Summers.	1

0	1 in 40 Americans probably won't even support him, let alone know who he is unfortunately.	1
1	I think the catch depends on whether or not you believe there is already an institutionalized redistribution of wealth occurring. Bernie believes there is already such system flowing money to the top and he wishes to change that by creating (and destroying) policy to stop that flow.  If you feel that things are already fair, then you would see those policies as decreasing fairness and institutionalizing flow from the top down.	1

0	Seriously, watching reddit ejaculate over this whole Bernie Sanders thing is so gross. The dude is never going to win and he's clearly just there to soak up all your votes. So when it comes to election time he endorses the front runner of his party and then all of you end up voting for them or don't vote at all. It's nice to hope but be realistic and save your money, children.   Edit: I'm all for a change to the two party system but when you're turning down big money because of "ideals" then you're clearly not in it to win it.	1

1	If you think Sanders favors centrally planned economics in any meaningful sense of the term, I fear you are very much mistaken.  He's certainly not a Leninist, and in fact isn't much of a socialist. He's a social democrat, in the Scandanavian sense.	1

0	exactly, it has not increased.   And I am sorry, I get why African Americans dislike cops but look at the stats for the number of cops hurt / shot by them compared to other races.... Then you have riots like this. Is it all that surprising why the distrust goes both ways.	1
0	As Tip O'Neil said, "All politics is local." Hillary was the 11th most liberal Senator because she represented New York, one of the most liberal states in America. Had she represented a state like Arkansas for example, I would venture to guess her voting record would have been at least slightly more conservative.	1

1	Murder is more serious than homicide.  However, murder usually requires both intent and malice.  Depraved Indifference is designed for scenarios where deliberate intent cannot be proven but the conduct described is still egregious and has a predictable result.      An example could be given of a person who decided to throw some cinder blocks off an overpass into the traffic below.  He more than likely could never be proven that he intended and prepared to murder a specific random passerby explicitly, but he could be proven to know that his actions endangered lives and could still be convicted on a murder charge, as opposed to a lesser manslaughter charge.	1
1	It doesn't matter if he is or isn't influenced.  It becomes a talking point that can be used to discredit him.  No one would believe he had a SuperPAC or took large donations from corporations and didn't allow it to influence him.  It's like the TV/movie cliche of arresting a gangster without evidence, then letting them go free and clear.  They are suddenly suspect to their allies because "Hey, why did the police just let you go?"	1
1	Too busy calling both sides equal	1
0	Irrelevant.  Neocons and Wall Street banksters don't mind gay marriage. In fact, many of them are homos themselves   And just look at the spectacle of Big Corporations threatening to boycott Indiana. I'm afraid corporate doesn't mind gay rights at all.	1

0	I'm actually surprised you think it's so obvious. Structurally, the government is the same. People haven't changed, human nature is the same. We had an arguably more liberal president then than we do now. Sure, social mores are different, but that stuff changes all the time. What major differences between the government of the US then and the current government are there?	1
1	Do these idiots have anything serious to run on other than "Obama is bad?"	1
1	&gt; the Obama administration, in conjunction with the U.S. military and Wal-Mart, is planning to impose martial law on much of the country.   Wal-Mart??   Obama &amp;  fucking Wal-Mart??  I guess Wal-Mart lures you in the front door with **LOW LOW** prices, takes your gun away, and forces you out the back door and into one of the many shipping containers and truck you off to the FEMA camps where you will be fed to the reptilian aliens.  amirite??	1

1	More exposure results in more votes. More money allows for more exposure. If Sanders can't get his message out, or if it gets lost amidst the media blitz of others, then he won't win. He's already fighting a massive uphill battle to get recognized, and his demographic isn't exactly known for hitting the polls. Not having enough money could easily lose him the race.	1

1	VP is not "useless," but it's not a placement that Warren would be useful in. If I were Bernie, I would ask John Kerry.

There is no corruption too deep, so why not?	1
1	I wish people would not vote on stupid shallow reasons like "old and crazy hair." I mean really, if we're going there, don't vote for Hillary, she looks like Beetlejuice!	1
1	He can still win.  We just need to give him money. The worker of the US need to give him money so he can fight what he believes in	1
1	It's not like it is some wild and crazy idea either. Almost every other industrialized country has it.   Americans just tend to be ignorant and misinformed about it. Unfortunately.	1
0	Ok, I usually hate democrats. But I'm starting to like this guy.	1
0	Bunch of fucking communists coming out of the woodwork!   No surprise on Reddit.   Easy to be a commie when you live in mommy and daddy's basement and mooch free shit off them all day long.	1
0	Honestly I fail to see why that is unethical. You are saying that market-based healthcare is discriminating against the poor? Sure. Unethical? I don't think so.   It costs a lot of money to invest in advanced medical equipment and pharmaceutical research. Keeping the healthcare sector capitalistic maintains the profit incentive necessary to advance medical care.	1
1	But if he does win then it'll set the precedent for a massive overhaul of how elections are funded.	1
1	Still a message I'd rather get behind.	1
1	Am I the only one that feels like this is just kiddy table politics that won't matter in the least? I guess I'm just the thrice beaten dog.	1

1	He (and Hillary too) are going to get called it anyway, might as well start embracing it and telling people what it means.	1
1	It's selfish.  That's really how you describe conservatives, selfish.  They only care if it happens to them.	1
0	Speaking as a fellow Ohioan, I have to say that Kasich is scary and should be taken extremely seriously as a potential presidential candidate.	1

0	You realize this is the same argument that Liberals use to discredit the Patriot Act.  When you make someone accountable, you get transparency.  Take away the initials EPA and replace them with CIA or FBI.  Federal Agencies should not be able to operate without accountability of proof.	1
1	Yeah, I basically don't trust Clinton to be genuine about anything.  I'll vote for her in the general if she wins the nomination, but purely because I don't trust *any* Republican politician.  Sanders better pick a good VP candidate if he wins the nomination. He's older now than John McCain was in 2008, and there was concern then about McCain's age (and the fact that he picked Sarah "I'd be good at foreign policy because I can see Russia from my house" Palin as his VP).	1

0	Yeah which is a bit disheartening because I'm 100% pro-nuclear power. He's still my favorite candidate though.	1
1	Yet he seems to also be a true believer in the ideology.  He's hard to figure out.	1
1	You could write a fucking book on all the problems and implications of needing a victim to be perfect before caring about the underlying injustices of their death.	1
1	Well shit. I'm actually starting to like a presidential candidate.	1
0	Did you read the article?  They aren't denying any science.  They simply want the EPA to publish their findings.  Why is that such a horrible bill?	1
1	And that's a pretty big deal. Obama was still a very young politician when he started getting the spotlight on him for the presidency. Sanders has a long career, and more than that, he has a consistent career in his voting record. That's pretty damn hard to find.	1
0	Believe me, I hate it too.   I would rather see four parties. Center and far left and right.	1

1	**Bernie Sanders** is the only serious presidential candidate in America...  As he is the only candidate that calls out Citizens United for what it is; The legalization of bribery and extortion of politicians, and the blatant corruption of American "Democracy" by moneyed interests.  We need a President that tells truth to power and money, not one that bows down to it.    A vote for a **republican** is a vote **for Oligarchy**.   A vote for **Hillary may be** a vote **for Oligarchy-lite**.   A vote for **Bernie is** a vote **against Oligarchy** and a vote to take money out of politics.  The choice is simple as fuck.	1

0	Well you gotta hand it to them at least they showed up to their state primaries and elected themselves as delegates in an attempt to take over the national convention.  what are you going to do during your state's primary season?  antagonize right-libertarians online?  Seriously maybe people on the right are "weird in real life" but at least they aren't lazy	1
1	Fuck em.  They are only losing subscribers to actual news.  I mean, they are developing shows on the news network.  They are interesting shows and are developed like 60 minutes type news programs, so they are pretty good.  But they are trying to find themselves again since there is no war to cover anymore.	1
1	He has done two, you can look them up on his subreddit /r/SandersForPresident	1
1	President Obama has done a pretty solid job as POTUS, I would say. I think history will probably look on him favorably. He's not my main guy, but I wouldn't be upset if he got a third term.	1
0	Bernie Sanders: Forever pimpin, never slippin, that's how it is.	1
1	Where does it say in the Constitution and Bill of Rights that Anonymous speech should be free?   It is not a component of free speech.  Free is just free of government censorship. Money is not speech. Money is work made capital via fiat.   The problem is we have already heard most of this and then some. It will be full of the usually empty buzzwords like "free speech", improper use of "logical fallicy" claims, and using appeals to be open on arguments that are long defeated by the arguing parties own data long ago.	1

0	I'm not a pure libertarian. I don't think any single ideology answers all the questions. I do, however, lean heavily towards libertarianism,.   Regarding healthcare specifically, I think that a nationalized system is the best way. A single payer system, while not perfect, does solve all of the most important problems with that particular niche.   There's no way for the healthcare workers and the people being treated to enter into an equitable and informed agreement when emergencies arise and the only option is to render services and hope for the best. Both sides get screwed in the current system.	1
0	I'm interested as to what basis this statement has.   A simple google search will tell you that Hillary was noted for considerable accomplishments as a senator.   http://correctrecord.org/the-points/attack-right-wing-ignores-hillary-clintons-achievements-as-senator/	1

Telling people that they think they can actually live without big brother watching over them that they are uninformed, immature polyannas living in a fantasy land.   The "real world" is big and dangerous and you need the NSA to keep you safe!	1
1	How does the old saying go?  Something about "reality is what's left when you stop believing in it."  Edit: I suppose the downvote is deserved, as it is neither old nor a saying.  I found it:  &gt; “Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.”  --  Philip K. Dick	1

0	Not wanting Ted Cruz to be President is as racist as everyone said not wanting Obama to be President was.	1
1	At this point he's got my vote, but I have learned never to trust a politician completely, no matter how genuine they may seem.	1
1	&gt;voted in lower numbers in 2012  Yeah, because the guy they elected seemingly renigged on much of the Hope and Change he platformed on. Disillusion can happen.  50 years ago social media wasn't even a thing. Hell, 5 years ago it didn't have the impact it does now. You're insane if you think young people will have less effect now than in the past.	1
0	this is all well documented fact, buddy.	1
0	Well let's not lie about the situation. He made eye contact with the officers and then bolted which is cause for the officer to purse and search, upon search they found an illegal switchblade. It's not like he was just standing around. That being said he should not of been given a rough ride or deserved to die. But by no means was this man a saint. It's important that we tell the whole truth here not hyperbole.	1
0	He's been on the front page of the internet for days now and 1% of 1% of the American population care enough to give him money. Impressive, but it's not giving me a lot of hope for his campaign.   The guy is in reality less electable than Ron Paul.	1
1	Until you realize that the donations given to republican Super PACs absolutely dwarfed what Bernie got :(	1
1	He's running as democrat, so be sure to switch before the primaries. And please vote in the primaries. Every little bit counts when running against the giant Clinton machine.	1
1	Relavant xkcd: https://xkcd.com/1019/	1
0	But, if the overall average wage decreases as a result of offshoring, is it really a net positive? More people being paid less is good?   I don't see lower prices as a canonical "good thing" for consumers if ethics are thrown out the window. Watch John Oliver's recent 'fashion' video for a case in point.	1

0	And just think you made your political decision based on a flimsy idea of who this person actually is without doing any real research whatsoever. Congratulations your now a democrat.	1
0	Or perhaps they're both for the people. Hillary is more at the center and Bernie is more towards the left. While I would prefer someone to the left, I wouldn't claim that Hillary isn't for the people or doesn't care about people as some here are.	1
1	Yeah, look what happened to Ron Paul.	1
0	If we enforced our immigration laws and deported them like we are supposed to that wouldn't happen.	1
0	It's definitely possible. People who enjoy controlling others and having power over others would naturally be drawn to a position of authority that inherently elevates them above their peers (like being a police officer), so maybe. But either way, there are pleeennnty of shit people who aren't cops, my only point.	1
1	I don't think that will be the case now. Reddit's userbase has grown so large and varied that it'd be impossible.	1
1	Yes... we must forward sanders and inflate lesser social media's with Sanders... this can start the movement!!!	1

1	Not sure what you're saying.  I'm saying if they get off or get reduced sentencing, the riots are going to be worse.  All the more reason to prosecute aggressively.	1
0	I think if you define crazy in terms of distance from the political center, Paul and Sanders are crazy. I could cite Hong Kong for libertarian policies in the manner that you do with Europe for more democratically socialist. Just because a policy exists elsewhere doesn't make it less crazy. So here are two candidates, not loved by the mainstream media, shunned by their parties and major league financial agents, who's supporters view them as deities. You just think his pipe dream will be the best smoke, because you agree with his stances, just as I did with Ron Paul in 2012. Principle&gt;Pragmatism. (np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/34fy03/can_we_not_ron_paul_this_guy/	1
0	What's more important to you? Electing Sanders or keeping people who deny science out of the white house?  I'm as big a Sanders fan as anyone. I identify as a socialist myself.  But we are screwed if by some miracle he were to win the nomination over Hillary. I have many issues with her that are too long to post here, but she is the only shot democrats have at the white house.	1
1	That wouldn't be a good ticket.  Sanders would need someone younger, more charismatic, and with different experience.  Perhaps a young Governor or Mayor.	1
0	I've heard claims such as yours but just haven't seen those positive changes on a personal level. Any problems with your insurance plan are amplified because now the provider and the Marketplace point the finger at each other, so figuring out a billing issue is a massive undertaking almost on par with passing this legislation in the first place (joking).  Also, my wife is in medical school and assists very low-income families. One woman barely makes any money and lives in a terrible neighborhood, yet she pays $400 a month for coverage! For HERSELF!	1
0	If Ron Paul didn't run on the republican ticket he would have had a much better chance in getting young people to give a shit.	1

0	Think about what controlling for those variables does.  Of *course* no one gets smarter or dumber by affiliating with a political party.  It implies that Democrats have a larger proportion of scientifically illiterate people due to those variables.	1
1	Heck, maybe we should get a few decent programmers to write a solid video game app as a fundraising tool.  I'm a pretty decent writer, so I can try to help in some way along those lines.  i'm not against doing everything we can.  I'm just cynical.	1

0	You're so deluded you probably believe that.  People. or in your example "white people" don't leave just cause. They leave to get away from the very same people that tear down a city. And it goes all the way to the top. Bad management who dont seek to improve the city, but to keep people desperate and line their own pockets.	1
1	&gt; Cops without body cameras, cars without dash cams, the ability for Hillary Clinton's correspondence to go entirely unchecked as Secretary of State.  These aren't really covered under what the NSA does. Body cams for cops and knowing what government officials are doing are good, as they're holding public officials accountable, but the NSA is in the business of recording any and all private information on citizens - a completely different subject.	1
1	There's an issue that doesn't get enough attention. Even if jobs are created, many of them are typically low wage, thereby not really doing anything to improve the tax base.	1
0	PERFECT EXAMPLE!!  After 50 years of almost unbroken Democrat leadership (see a pattern?), New York City was considered one of the world's most dangerous cities with sky high crime and murder rates. It was a pretty gross place to live too.   Then a Republican (Rudy Giuliani) was elected mayor in 1994 and NYC has since been completely transformed.   Thanks for bringing that up!	1
0	Rationality left the minute he said he was in it to win.  Fortunately however, you don't need a structural winning campaign to bring essential messages to a public stage. but anyone who claims this is anything more than that is taking a dump on the sense of honesty that should be the backbone of the campaign.	1
1	Her favourite book is the bible, though!	1
1	Donating is a brilliant idea. Sanders has already announced he is not going to raise money with a SuperPAC....so he's not going to have billionaires with unlimited amounts of cash to give his campaign.

1	Nothing would recapture my faith in US govt more than a Sanders/Warren White House, but they are both much alike. The slot of VP has become a marketing ploy to attract the party's more hard-leaning voters. I love the idea of two bank-busters making it into the White House on grass-roots dimes. But Clinton could use Warren more as a veep, to attract the more extreme left that believes Clinton's too centrist.	1
1	More than 80 clinics closed, that only provided well woman care and (the point) contraceptives.

"Christian conservatives". Fascists.	1

0	I am not saying it is crazy to raise minimum wage, my main point, once again is that even if they raise the wage to 15/hr, when the worker can't get 40hrs/week it doesn't help.  Most definitely someone with kids will have it way harder, but dual income, child support, family support, or government aide should help a bit.  And for any middle aged person in a minimum wage job, I feel very sympathetic.  At that age, you SHOULD have somehow aquired some non entry level skills.  Anyways, it is totally possible to LIVE not comfortably or like a baller, but to LIVE on minimum wage.	1

Only then will we have be able to live in a free paradise that we all long for.	1
0	He's a bit kooky, but how is he racist?	1
1	I'm all for Sanders, he has my vote. But even if he were to win the presidency, he's only president. He is still going to have to fight tooth and nail against billionaire bankrolled senate and congress.  Don't forget those votes too. If you want real representation by the people, for the people, get corporations out of office in all branches of government.	1
0	Except that Sanders is window dressing for the Democrats to kthe  attract intelligent voters' attention.  Bait and switch. Hillary is the golden candidate, and she will be the "Democratic Leadership Commitee's" choice. If she dies during the campaign, they will present Biden in her place.  Candidates whom the majority of Americans could morally support will have no more chance of winning than Robert Kennedy had in 1968.	1
1	don't be rediculous.  Of course we americans deserve proper leaders.  The current status quo is horse shit.  We've deserved better for forty years.	1

Build your message and response from there. If you're good enough, people on /r/politics will support you and spread your word. You have the power. Shoot, you can even turn down super PACs and just have reddit send you a few bucks a month because anonymous people on reddit love and support your message, and they want to promote you. Put ads online, on TV, on the radio. You can do it.	1

1	Earth science is a core mission of NASA.  That's why NASA does so much Climate Change research.  The oil industry/Koch bros want to kill anything the gov't does toward that end to minimize the public's knowledge of the truth and the possible use of any evidence to back anti-green house gas regulations (say, by the EPA which has been in their crosshairs for years).  Remember, the Koch bros. are funding the GOP election to the tune of nearly a BILLION dollars.  But hey, the parties are the same.  So, stay home.  Don't vote.  /s	1
1	Dude, I'm taking about time travel for the purpose of deliberately fucking over the country... What part of this screams "in-depth analysis of the factors attributing to the 2008 economic collapse"? What drives you to be so defensive over Bush that you rush to defend his name over an absurd joke poking fun at Cruz and his absurd statements?	1
1	You keep saying that the Feds should give "back" the land to a state that never owned it in the first place.   I think that's part of the conservative propaganda. Take out the word "back" and it's just red states begging for more handouts.	1

1	This is a perfect example of everything that is wrong with this country right now. This guy would rather wage his "war" on Obama rather than work work across the aisle in any capacity. When your only reason for not confirming someone is that you don't like the guy who appointed him it's time to resign and just go home. Politics has become akin to a sports rivalry where people just root for their favorite team. It's stupid and it's not how it's supposed to work.	1

1	&gt; billionaires start making contributions through his online site  They'd be limited to the same 2.6k limit as everyone else.  But you're right that Bernie can't stop someone from forming a PAC on his behalf. It might undercut his stance and be counter productive, though. He'd be instantly labeled a hypocrite.	1
1	I do think he has a chance, however small it may be.	1
1	This. Bernie himself has said many times that people need to get involved. He knows he will be outspent and that the media won't take him seriously. But he believes, based on his recent travels around the country, that there is great potential for a true grassroots movement, and that is what he needs in order to have a real chance. The key is that people need to get actively involved.	1

1	I see a complete breakdown of trust in the police in the US.  It is the job of the police to make sure that trust exists. It is their fault and their fault only that it doesn’t. If you have a monopoly over violence making sure you are trusted is one of your most important jobs, one that police in the US constantly fails at.  And all they do is whine and blame others. Really. It’s comical. Making sure you are trusted is your job, it’s the job of the one legally wielding the baton and the gun.	1

Someone who disapproves of some of the actions we have taken? Unless there's someone who runs for the literal physical destruction of the U.S. or on physically harming Americans. I don't understand how a politician could be Anti-American. Or to say if someone has painted you a picture of someone's policies as Anti-American it's probably just an attempt to dissuade you from viewing those policies out of fear of you agreeing which them and threatening their bottom line. I would be Anti-those-Americans.	1
1	I'm fairly certain you understood the point of my post, but you completely failed to address it. I'll ask again, with just a tad bit less snark.... What makes one religion anymore legitimate than another? Every religion is convinced that their story is right and everyone else's is wrong, so what makes any one legitimate than any other? With regard to religious freedom, why should my sincerely held beliefs be treated any different than yours?	1

Also, Hillary has not disclosed the money she has earned in that same time period. (Likely to be more, but she doesn't want the people to know she is backed by the banks)	1
0	why are you obsessed with "everyone"? It works for 95% of people. That's good enough. The rest can get roommates or move. We're not basing our policies on exceptions.

You're not allowed to bitch about it anymore.	1

0	I'm not a1%er and that all sounds good to me.   Those Republican policies sure have made a mess of Baltimore.   They've been running Baltimore since 1967.  Oh wait, that has been liberal Democrats with liberal policies. Great schools, 99% of high school students graduating,  higher incomes for everyone, ... of course it's the exact opposite but Obama claims he "now"- just now -  has come up with the solution. It's "more money!" Does it change the fact that massive amounts of spending have done little in the war on poverty? Duh....	1
1	Sure, but one of his biggest platforms is climate change, and has been for a long time. It's not like he wants us all on fossil fuels. Think carbon caps, tax relief for solar power, tighter EPA restrictions, way fewer tax breaks for big oil. At least, as much as a President can help those things. He's been one of the biggest enemies of the keystone pipeline in congress.	1
1	For all real world purposes yes.  It's put into hedge fund securities, insurance hedges, and forex arbitration systems.  It keeps the assets mobile, untraceable, and outside any individual governments influence.  In a market that deals in purely virtual commodities, as a way to hoard about $20+ trillion of the worlds wealth.  It's the reason there are a hundred islands around the world with 12 drunk fisherman and a 'bank' moving a billion dollars a day.	1
0	Haha, this was genuinely hilarious. Without cause, he decides you're a kid. Then when you're much more experienced than he is, he calls you grandpa. The ironic part is that he was questioning your age, and all of his submissions are to video game and TV subs. What a clown. Haha	1
0	I'm just not going to support someone who has no chance in a general election.   His voting record on trade, reproductive rights, healthcare, and many other issues earn my profound respect, and I think he is a brave, brilliant man.   But we live in a country with people who believe that a President who is a fiscal moderate and a war hawk is a socialist.  Realistically speaking, Senator Sanders is going to be spending other people's money on a campaign that was doomed before it began.	1

0	Me too. Personally, I think there should be a cap on any contribution, whether personal or corporate (though corporate donations should be banned). As we all have but one vote, we should all have one amount to give. It's ridiculous that campaigns are business ventures now.    I'm glad I'm looking at things from the other side. You see the flaws in your own arguments and see your own biases.	1

0	&gt; This is where it has lead us. And THIS is not a good place. We need dramatic change. We need massive paradigm shifts.

Absolutely - but overall, particularly being an American, is pretty sweet to be honest.	1

1	When you cuff a man's arms and legs then drive him around for 40 minutes, while denying him medical care he repeatedly requested, without a seat belt, that's pretty culpable.

0	This *repeated* claim is simply untrue if you spend some time thinking through the economics of it.  https://www.economy.com/dismal/analysis/datapoints/253947/Government-Assistance-and-Work/  "Unfortunately, there is little basis to claim that most public assistance programs benefit employers. "  Also, if someone *really* believes this to be the case, why don't we eliminate these public assistance programs? Surely if they are just going mostly to help corporations, there would be not large outcry if they were taken away, since corporations will simply pay more...right?	1

That cannot happen in a homosexual marriage. Which spouse gets to see the child? By law it can only be one since two men and two women cannot naturally conceive. If you want to create parental rights simply by marriage, you would see straight couples ceasing to get married.	1

Police had said Gray was arrested for possessing a switchblade, but Mosby said Friday the knife in Gray's possession was not a switchblade and was lawful, and said officers "illegally arrested" Gray.  He was illegally arrested and killed.  I commend the State Attorney's office for uncovering the facts and not participating in a cover-up.  It's a shame that this course of action is not the norm.	1
1	Seriously, it was the top story on Google news, it's not just reddit.	1
0	Good on Bernie for making a big deal about not breaking campaign finance law! We should praise him for being exactly like every other presidential candidate since it is illegal to coordinate with SuperPACs as a candidate.	1

1	I hate the comparisons to Ron Paul. Please stop making them. Paul had numerous positions that did not survive having light shown on them. As soon as people saw them, they wrote him off. His failure was in part due to the "establishment", but a very large part was also his own positions.  Sanders should be broadcasting *all* of his positions to the country as often as he possibly can. His voting record and vision for the country really resonates with most (young) people. Paul's didn't past the surface.	1
0	Obviously. But do they need to? If all we're finding out is politician A and politician B are fiddling each other, then it would be better to remove surveillance to increase relations while reducing costs, or subverting those resources somewhere more beneficial.	1

Keep people poor so that they are willing to fight in our bullshit wars for a paycheck.    Keep people poor so that they are miserable and turn to Christianity.  We can use Christianity to manipulate them for votes.	1

From bush jr claiming god spoke to him, to Michelle Bachman just reinventing history, to Cruz and David duke ..jeez the list goes on forever..it is scary crazy. It's scrazy. it hasn't been about politics for a long time for them. It is about religious fundamentalism, racism, and fear-mongering..And somehow they are in charge...	1

0	That may be true, but Baltimore is predominately controlled by democrats so it's a pretty far stretch to blame republicans for what happened there.  I think the real problem is lack of police training/internal controls and the culture that lets them think they could get away with arresting someone without cause and then intentionally not putting a seatbelt on the guy.	1
1	Which worked out so well in China.	1
0	For one university, it's not the increase in students. It's the increase in student demand. If the demand hadn't spiked, then a university that raised their tuition would have a lot less students (all else equal). All those business majors are hired because A) schools don't know what else to spend all this new money on, and B) schools don't have shareholders to return excess cash to.	1

That'll have more effects than anything else. They are wealthy and there is nothing wrong in using your influence. Washington, Jefferson, Madison, FDR, JFK were all massively wealthy, and used a lot of soft money . The Koch brothers aren't household names outside of the politically in tune class of people. I dare you to find someone on the street who has any Idea what they look like or what their business does. This is political grandstanding at its worst.	1
0	Of course. And if you'd rather have someone like Rand Paul than Hilary if Bernie isn't nominated, vote for Rand!	1

0	I don't believe that chart for a second. So you're saying that Obama, who passed Romney's plan, is more liberal than LBJ, who basically established medicare? It's well documented the US has shifted right since Reagan. Do you really think Bill Clinton is more liberal than Jimmy Carter?	1
1	I just realized how much Bernie Sanders sounds like [Larry David's George Steinbrenner.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJtDt10fRqw)	1
1	Hillary is lying. Don't believe her and support Bernie.	1
1	This reminds me of the time I posted an article about how Mark Cuban doesn't approve of net neutrality and they removed my submission. Then I contacted the mods and asked why to get a 'we don't allow articles about specific individual people in /r/politics.' So I linked to a search within /r/politics which clearly demonstrated the hundreds of articles with "Mark Cuban" in the title currently posted. No response. Nice.  *Keep it liberal, or keep it off this sub.*	1
0	Baltimore shows us what happens when Democrats win for 50 years	1
1	It's clearly a case of blaming the policies of the earlier president for one period and blaming the policies of the later president for the other. It's a shoddy, inconsistent argument.  &gt;How is this relevant?  If Carter is relevant in discussing 78-82, then Bush is relevant in discussing 08-12. Don't act like that's not obvious.	1
0	I agree with the first sentence and mostly agree with the sentiment of your comment. The second sentence shows that you need to read the point he is making more carefully.	1

0	&gt;If you say that you don't feel people are responsible enough to exercise their rights, you are saying they shouldn't have them.   No, I'm just saying I personally feel most people are not responsible enough to be gun owners. It's like how I fully support your right to call a muscle bound biker all sorts of names, but think you shouldn't... I'm pretty sure the outcome is going to be really bad, but support your right to make your own poor decisions.	1

0	I wouldn't doubt it. But at the same time Ahmadinejad had some crazy conspiracy theories too, so it's not to loopy to think that this general has just bought into what the Steel Beams crowd is saying.	1

0	[It's a myth.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-hoff-sommers/wage-gap_b_2073804.html)  It doesn't make sense that it would exist.  If it were true, cheaper labor from women with the same skill sets would quickly crowd out men's labor.  If I'm a business owner and I could get the same quality labor from a woman at 3/4 the cost I would lay off all the men and hire women.	1

0	Are you saying there are no black guys who have been in leg irons and gone home? I must of been mistaken during my stay at LA County. Most of those people I met didn't have life sentences and I am sure they all didn't die. They also wore leg irons.	1
1	That's really not true. There were lots of rules that allowed special interests to donate, and many candidates were just as bought and paid as they are now. CU just put it in the open.	1
1	Anything is better than Hillary.	1
1	It's a theory that's well supported by evidence; just like gravity is a theory that's well supported by evidence.  You are free to launch bricks into the air above your head, but to make doing so, government policy is idiotic.	1
0	I love how the level of discourse in politics for you is "I'd prefer that their name sound like cock."  Seriously.  This is what it has come to.  Dick jokes.    Embarrassing.  Look at /u/misnomer89 below you.  "I much prefer to say boner."   Sometimes I think there should be a test for voting.  Not really.  But maybe.  To keep the people talking about dick jokes, instead of policies, out.	1

1	Isn't that the idea?	1
0	Exactly. I'm pretty fucking sick of being told that it's my fault nothing changes, because I don't vote in favor of everything staying the same.	1
0	You absolutely should. Like I told Asmatic below, Sanders brings some good stuff to the table that Clinton will be forced to address. I'm not saying you shouldn't vote for Sanders or help with his campaign, I'm saying you shouldn't go around saying that he has a realistic shot of winning the presidency or blaming his low poll numbers on "the media" or whatever scapegoat you want to use, when the reality is he's just not a statistically good candidate.	1
0	&gt; Let's face it...he has rebuilt America, and Americans are greatly benefiting. &gt;    Race riots and racial tensions, which seems to be getting worse, and fake economy, based on money $trillions in printing and artificially low interest rates creating a massive stock bubble that will destroy more of  the middle class, are nothing to brag about.	1
1	Ha, we will be doing well if they get a transportation bill passed. These guys can't pass gas.	2
1	So it's not about helping labor and the middle class, it's about electing a "Democrat"?  Thanks, I'll pass.	2
0	Yes, wouldn't want him to become a taker.	2
0	She was also a Barry Goldwater fan. Is it hard to think her position on American foreign policy changed over 30 years? Hell, mine changed in the past 10.	2
0	I believe you just proved my point. And there are just as many democrats pissing and moaning and screaming for the removal of our rights.	2
1	Sure, if you want a Republican to be the next President go ahead.	2
1	It's more that he's asking what this country could be, and quite frankly it's about god damn time.	2
1	It's deceptive because it's only showing large contributors. It's not showing all of her contributors. In total, Hillary received far more in small donations from retired folks than she did from Wall Streeters:  https://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/indus.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00000019	2
0	Wtf are you talking about? If 6% of eligible voters are undecided and 6-8% of likely voters are also undecided... then HOW THE FUCK does the distinction matter?	2
1	I can tell you if he moves to Massachusetts he would be eligible for  Romney Care.	2
1	This is ugly, oversimplified, poorly worded, biased, and flat out wrong. One example: Hillary doesn't support affordable college? Pretty sure she's saying that she wants to make college free.   Sincerely,  A Sanders supporter.	2
0	You suspect incorrectly. Read the article, then we'll talk.	2
1	&gt;there's absolutely no one in the GOP that can win a debate against Bernie.  Probably, but the GOP wins popularity contests with one-liners ("That answer's as clear as Boston Harbor!") over content and besides the media will tell them who won, if they look at all.	2
1	My problem is I still feel bad for the guy and wish there was healthcare available to him even if he made his own bed. I guess that's the real difference between the left and right.	2

1	My and my families condolences to the Biden family.	2
0	You're failing to support yours by offering a comparable situation. You argued if Bernie wins the primary, he'll lose the general. I asked, "Based on what?" You said past candidates. Then you offered no comparable candidate (a liberal democrat who wins in the primary but loses the general). I didn't even ask for a candidate from a recent election, yet you've failed to provide any evidence for your ridiculous claim. Have a nice day, moron. I'm done.  You may want to read up on who burden of proof works in argument.	2
0	The difference between Hillary and Sanders is that Hillary will be on the ballot in November, 2016.  Sanders won't. When the Democratic primaries start up next year, he won't be seen as a viable candidate.   Sanders' role is to generate interest in the race. They're looking for you to react exactly the way you just did: getting excited about the political process.	2

1	Same data set on opensecrets shows that HRC got $82,000 from the Plumbers Union, $43,000 from the Operator Engineers Union, and about $40,000 from the Laborers Union. This graphic is a little "apples to oranges" given the different scales of their previous campaigns.	2

1	No I want Bernie Sanders	2
0	&gt;Gay marriage? She's all for it,   Now that it's popular enough she is.  I don't think it's vary admirable that she waited for public opinion to come around before she threw her support behind it.	2
0	Sorry, that was republican only. Regardless, all of them say around 6-8% of total likely voters were undecided. So the distinction between eligible voters and likely voters is still irrelevant.	2
1	"See I did it and I didn't need shitty obamacare"	2
1	but is she TRULY for gay marriage?  Whatever the fuck that means.  Does Bernie Sanders officiate gay weddings or something?  For me, the most damning thing about Hilary is how she literally organized protests against Vietnam when she was younger, but then voted for the Iraq War.  That vote was either her eviscerating her beliefs to pander to popular opinion or admitting she doesn't actually believe anything at all.  I'd vote for her over Paul and Cruz, but I'm hoping there is a serious Democratic challenger.	2

How the US is allowing Virginia's Appalachian population to be sick and pregnant with no access to the drugs and care that they need unless you fall into a very narrow margin to receive it for free.

Not that they are destined to, as he claimed that “any person in this county…can become a middle-class person, unless he’s mentally or physically disabled.”  What an ignorant man.	3
1	You know, even if he doesn't win the Democratic Primary, I'm glad he's running because he's shifting the conversation to places it needs to be, and hopefully that will pull other Democratic Candidates more to the left.	3

1	Whoa whoa whoa. Jesus rode a dinosaur!	3
0	So Bernie Sanders wants to ban unions and interested groups (UCS, AFSA, IAVA, etc) from backing candidates that support the sciences (UCS) or veterans (AFSA, IAVA)?  Dark money is a problem, but banning organized groups from advocating their position and the position of those they represent is wrong.      Sunlight, mandatory transparency is the only viable option.  /gotta love downvotes for being a not-stupid-liberal. ya'll ignorant fools need to graduate from college and get your shit together.	3
1	Well, come on. He had cornrows. /s	3

0	Oh don't go. What will I ever do without you?	3
0	No wait, local school boards are the YouTube comment section of governments. Local and county governments are the 4chan comment section of governments. State governments are the /r/conservative comments of governments.  Or something like that.	3

0	Was pointing out your misguided judgement that they aren't giving up on abortions or gay marriage. Yeah. We have.	3
1	Yeah but this would never work in the U.S. because of some bullshit excuse the right wing media will come up with.  ^^But ^^it ^^would ^^really ^^work.	3
0	Right, because black people are too dumb to have a state-issued ID or something, right?	3
1	Yes they were, but workers weren't also treated like expendable trash like they are today.  As for the rest, this was before all of that.  I'm no Hillary fan, but the hamfisted stuff that gets posted out of context to bash her is so much like Swiftboating that I'm sure if it's the Sanders contingent here that got militant *fast* or Republicans pretending to be liberals.	3
0	What about my comment was confusing to you?	3
0	&gt;“people who receive government benefits tend to vote for people who support those benefits.”  Or, people who receive government favors tend to buy the government that will give them those favors.	3
0	They said the same thing about Bush and Gore and voted for Nader.  How did that work out?  You think Clinton and Paul, and by the way why do you only refer to her as Hillary but to Paul as Rand Paul?, will have equivalent Supreme Court nominees?  You think Clinton would sign a bill neutering the EPA?  Or stopping abortions?	3
0	You could get one of the 10,000,000's of Muslims who reject what happens or the one who is as crazy as Geller. Get the crazy one and then hope your dim-witted viewers assume he speaks for ALL Muslims.  And on the killing gays, I can link to christians who feel the same way.	3
1	Even if every democrat that voted in 2012 gave Bernie $5, it would still only be 300 Million.   The winning candidate will spend over 1.5 billion in the next election	3
0	&gt; Punishment serves no purpose.  I hope you mean this in this specific case, and not in general - because that would be *madness*. Human beings need to carrot AND stick to ensure they behave well; providing only the carrot will not overcome the natural laziness of human character.	3

1	I'll be voting for Sanders in the primaries; if he wins, it's evidence that he can (and probably will, given the GOP field) beat whoever the Republican nominee is. If he loses, Clinton wins the presidency anyway.  Really, it comes down to the fact that the GOP field is so god awful that even their own base doesn't want to vote for any of them.	3

1	Politifact: Our ruling  Huckabee said he "raised average family income by 50 percent" during his tenure as Arkansas governor.  Once you account for inflation, Huckabee is incorrect. Income in Arkansas increased 20 percent, not 50 percent. That increase trailed nationwide trends.   The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.	3
1	It isn't scary if you want a Democrat to win.	3

0	If your argument resembles something like islam is an inferior culture and the west with it's noble and more advanced moral beliefs has the right to bomb islam countries, then you are no different than those who advocated colonialism.  See [G Greenwald's criticism of Sam Harris here](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/03/sam-harris-muslim-animus). I have yet to see any defender of Harris refute Greenwald's points.

About 20 years ago we banned semi-autos, autos, brought in other controls, you need a gun safe bolted to the floor etc. Before this, we had a similar number of shootings, but since the controls, not one mass shooting.

1	No ones saying a child conceived of that situation is evil. I assume you're being hyperbolic.   The reason people are upset at this disregards a women's right to choose what should happen. The statement upholds a narrative that says women should be happy to be pregnant, no matter how they ended up that way.  If a women keeps a child who's a result of rape, she should be commended and her choice respected. However, it needs to be her choice.	3

1	Tall, like me, adorable brown eyes, a cute but shy-looking smile. Metro haircut, tan skin, the type of skinny I've wanted to be for years. Effeminate, but not ridiculously so, might be gay, but that's not always an indicator. The first asian I've ever crushed on, so obviously he's doing something right. Great golfer apparently  Sometimes I feel like he's interested, but sometimes I feel like he doesn't even know I exist.	7
0	The problem here is that the teacher is basically forcing a student to do something for a grade that she isn't comfortable with. There is no reason to impose this, as I very much doubt learning genetics requires an actual coupling.  Besides, in this scenario, there's a zombie apocalypse happening. That's a hypothetical. If that hypothetical exercise can take place, then why can't the girl hypothetically combine her genes with a same sex partner? It's not like there's actually a baby, and we're pretty close with technology that would allow two women to conceive a baby without a man's sperm.	7
0	what was his name?	7
1	It could be your subconscious telling you that for you to find a partner you'll have to come out. Coming out may not be the best of the options and certainly won't gain you a relationship straight away but it will make things easier	7
0	So basicly eurovision is contest about what country have okay song and what they did in past year , cause it seems like that. Eurovision, where viewers vote for you not based on your song but what your country did in past decade. (Lets not forget that Germany had 0 points and they didnt have worst song)	7
0	Greens should of let Caroline Lucas be their leader.	7
0	In the match between TSM and fnatic i was rooting for TSM. But i'm not caring for any team. It was a one time deal. :D	7
0	&gt; It's a bit weird and forced if you actually watch the show and see Mordecai pining for Margaret all the time  Because someone *totally can't* be attracted to guys AND girls...	7
0	uh huh. like i said, thats how you say hi in my school. nothing sexual. its all just for fun.	7
1	If it sounds like he's serious, which I think he is, just talk to him about it. Next time you see him, just bring it up casually and ask him if he really meant it, and see where it takes you. Who knows, you might end up getting a boyfriend!	7
1	Not really hypocritical... But anyways, those are two completely different situations. You can't compare one to the other because one is human behaviour and the other is human nature.	7
1	Man, I should get out more.	7
0	Facepalm, Really schools? What you did is perfectly fine in my books. Do you have an image? :P	7
1	My face is as smooth as a baby's bottom. Hooray. I am not looking forward to facial hair.	7
1	Kinda defeats the purpose when they ignore the information. Was the workout right after filling out the form or a day or longer since, as in did he have time to read it before hand?	7

1	"Take them off" 10/10	7
1	Sounds like a lot of built up sexual tension. Go uhhhh do something about that.  On a side note: You are probably just crushing on him so hard because he is going to be graduating and will be leaving, and you will be alone. That's normal I guess. The best thing I can think of is to stick around here and find some friends to talk to. You are going to have to let go of your crush.	7
0	TL;DR: I'm lazy.	7
1	&gt; He knows I am supportive of trans genders people and subtly asked me to explain for everyone. I told him to shut up (basically).  ...why? You had an opportunity to soapbox without looking like an asshole. Take it.	7
1	I'd say Troye Sivan and Caspar Lee.  Yeah I'm not very original	7
1	Well, my max would probably be +5-8 years and -2 - 3. (dunno why but I would feel weird going out with a 14 yo. I am 18 atm).  BTW, legally you should wait another year to be 18.	7
0	Humans still have homophobia and sexism in their minds it's so fucking disgusting... :S   I just looked at my country's list of can't donate blood. It's only for men... Fucking human beings are so disgusting! I'm tired of being alive. FUCK!	7
0	He might just just be experimenting.	7
1	The most important thing to remember here is that sexuality does not need to have a label, and that it is fluid as hell. Only you know what you like, and if you want you can say your orientation is what you want it to be if you talk to anyone about your orientation.	7
1	Let him come out to you. He is still pretty young, so who knows if he is just curious. My parents used to always try and hint that they knew, which pushed me block those conversations.	7
0	Your brother is mentally ill and i suggest you find a doctor that can help him.	7
0	I'm pretty much opposed to the whole system for my own reasons, so I'm not voting for anyone.	7
1	You look like Troye? I have a marriage certificate for you to sign right here ;)  Seriously though, the whole of TRXYE is awesome, you should check it out if you haven't :)	7
1	Only go for it if you just want to have a fun time for a bit and if you know yourself well enough that you won't get too attached. Cause long distance sucks. Also, in my experience, going for someone mostly cause they're gay and maybe have some stuff in common can turn out mediocre. But I totally get where you're at and right now you're probably a little head over heels and that's alright. But maybe let that cool down a bit before you make any big decisions.	7

1	I agree with her most times and she doesn't seem like a bad person, but I must say her pretentious slam poetry is obnoxious. I can't watch her either.	7
1	Okay, I'm starting to worry that this entire sub has resorted to writing fanfiction to compensate for the sheer thirst contained within. Well, I can't really deny that I enjoy it, but wow, there's been an awful lot of crazy sex stories lately. Lucky fuckers.	7

1	Thanks. Yeah I know I'm old enough to make my own choices, but mom still treats me as her baby and has a lot of control over me right now. I don't want to risk making her uncomfortable for my sake but I also want to be treated more like an adult.	7
0	No it isn't! I totally get where you're coming from :)	7

0	oh ok then :) so this is good then	7
1	Dont be bitter... Just get better ;)	7
0	I'd just advise you not to risk it. There is no point pissing away a friendship over a *very* unlikely relationship that won't last long.  I've been through it and it isn't pretty.	7
0	No, no. That's the ideal crush, to be honest. Having one can suck (of course not literally, this isn't a fairytale). Everybody should remember to be their own at times. I hope I'm making sense	7
0	I dislike people that won't vote. Theure a waste to society. Like do your part  Be educated and vote.	7

1	Yeah... she obviously doesn't care about your room :p try tidying it, then see if she pulls another excuse. Besides, shouldn't you be allowed to decide if you wanna take your bf into your room? I'd go off on one if she tried to stop me doing that	7
0	Just in case there's any English people reading, in the next vote I'll be voting Green Party.  Also if you don't know much about Englands politics I recommend The Trews, this week is politics week.	7
1	Well.Not really a crush anymore since I've been crushed but he was my last crush and I'll say this, passionate, had the fire in his eyes to compete, adorable ski jump nose. Small eyes. Decently big lips. A huge smile which produced these adorable dimples, introverted yet hilarious, was a really good friend too. Our friendship may have ended abruptly and his thought of myself not on a positive note, but, hopefully it won't stay like that forever. Surely I'd love to just be his friend all over again. And make new memories. My crush was one of a kind.	7
0	This is a great answer. I went through a phase not too long ago when I got so bothered every time I saw flamboyant gay guys around me. I would always wonder, "why can't they just be *normal*?" But I realized that by thinking that, I was allowing society's homophobic standards for an "acceptable" and "unacceptable" gay person to justify judging someone for who they are. If we truly want equality, we can't let anyone try to tell us that "oh, you can be gay, just not *that* gay."	7

0	Being educated and voting aren't the same thing (why do Labour get any votes?). Also, we all have the right not to vote, which is inherent of the right to vote.	7

1	Lol, so I just sent my dad a picture of something that was on my computer screen (I was too lazy to find it on my phone) I just realized that if you pay attention you can see the tab open right next to it says "WE GET IT, YOU'RE GAY."  That'd be an interesting way to come out now wouldn't it...	7
0	I've been told since I was very little that I was a boy... Turns out I am XD	7
0	She and her partner could choose to copulate with the males before they are killed off... but that still doesn't address what will happen with all the inbreeding that will be required to repopulate the world.	7
1	You have to go through the LGBT process first, don't you know?  You have to get the seal of approval from:  * **L**averne Cox  * **G**eorge Takei  * **B**rad Altman  * and **T**rinity K. Bonet ~~(Shameless plug for RPDR)~~  *smacks lips like Alyssa Edwards*	7
0	I hope you all vote Green or Labour as they're the most committed to LGBTQ issues! And in my opinion they're just the best options we've got.  It's most important that everyone eligible bothers to vote at all, though. I voted Green this morning.	7
1	Take him off the pedestal. That solves a lot of things.	7
0	It wasn't at his expense? He made fun of me... The sexism just made it worse	7
0	But it is no reason for this rule. As you should be checked anyway. No matter if you are a man, woman, inbetween, neither; gay, straight, bi, pan, demi, ace or any other variation of whatever. Thus that rule is bullshit [PERIOD] The people who believe in that rule are idiots.	7

1	Embrace the longstanding human tradition of saying "fuck nature" and doing it your own way.	9
0	Ok what exactly did I say in that paragraph that pissed you off? This is what makes people shy Tories. Because they are vilified by left leaning people who either don't listen who buy into to the shit about right wing people being heartless bastards who are rich, so they don't reveal that they are Tory because the left wing voters are so annoying about it.	9
0	I'm not sure (not the person who suggested it) but the soft cup is softer and disposable.  Soft cup is very different from a regular menstrual cup, so personally I would say you should just jump in with a menstrual cup if that's what you want to use. I've heard of people having issues with the soft cup and not the diva cup, so I would hate for you to be turned off by soft cup issues when its very possible you won't have those issues with a diva cup.    But you can also just try it because it's cool and apparently you can have sex while wearing soft cup!	9
1	IKR?! How much hairspray goes on in just one of those videos?	9

0	Just for the record, I misread the "might" in your original comment. I apologize for that.  I know I am lucky because my family can help a little. That being said, the rest of the help I receive is available to anyone who qualifies.	9
0	Hahahahahahahaha. Sorry I know it sucks but if I could do this to my gf I would too. What you do is tell him you will get him off in other ways, do a Strip tease, blow him, tell him wait when he is about to burst, say "let's try anal" (if he asks why now tell him you need him inside you no matter what right now), and then get all lubed up, get him lubed up, get just the tip touching, then make a huge wet fart all over his dick and laugh.    He won't bother you for the rest of the week at least.	9
0	well, i think keto is restrictive while being lenient within the confines of the diet. you absolutely cannot eat a great number of things (carbs, sugar) but everything else is fair game. for me, the difficult thing was ascertaining precisely what i could and could not eat, which was really just a matter of looking up nutritional facts online and downloading myfitnesspal.	9

1	Everyone seems to love that sub but I must need an eli3 version. The advice seems pretty straight forward, but I never understand *why* they choose what they choose....	9
1	Epicfailer10's point was that you didn't have to list out that actual information instead of saying "hey, based on your post history I now know what you look like, your face, and _____." Listing out that information so anyone browsing this now knows her info because you so nicely summarized it for them.   You need to change your original post and remove her info. It looks like it's helpful, but it's not based on the info you included. That's doxxing. No bueno.	9
1	Right?! It feels like when your DVD player used to go out of sync, but on a constant loop.	9

0	I was asked to be the Maid of Honor at 20, going to school part time, and working full time. I agreed because I thought it was just a title, and had no idea the responsibilities that came with it. 0/10 Would not do again, unless I had a million dollars and no other work to speak of. Neither of those things will ever happen.	9
1	I had to do this and you know what? It was amazing. Going from a hostile environment with someone who mistreats you to an environment with someone who cares about you was the greatest thing for me. It was a rough split but I relied on my family and one or two close friends and got through it.  Good luck, you gotta take care of yourself :)	9
0	Oh, dude, coloring is cathartic as hell.  I used to do it at work in between 911 calls.  My sister did it all through medical school.  You just zone out and make things pretty.	9
1	It's a shame women don't wear their wedding rings on their middle finger as it would allow for an extra message to be communicated when showing it to people giving unwanted attention.	9
0	Why would you think that?  Making fun of small dicks is encouraged among women and society in general	9
1	Try hair clippers!! They even make *~girl~* razors that have those on the other end of it. I just sit on the toilet and trim it down before hopping in the shower to shave the rest off. It's so easy since I discovered that.	9

0	Why are you here?	9
1	Couldn't you replace 'women' with 'redditors' in that sentence and actually be correct?	9
1	I legit thought that was a Halloween/prop costume from the thumbnail. That's a fashion trend that won't happen even in "ironic" circles of Portland/Austin/Nashville/etc. Like, if I wore that people might not notice period stains, they'll just think I slaughtered someone and waltzed through their remains. I'd rather just be the natural bleeding woman.	9
1	I will! Just...timing and feels :(  More than that, I would love to let my Dad live with me when he is old if I ever have a huge house or something, but I don't think he will ever leave her, even if she leaves in her RV and they're "still married."	9
0	Acknowledging paedophilia as a sexual orientation is not the same as condoning child abuse.   I acknowledge heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality as orientations, but I'm still not okay with them raping whoever attracts them.	9
0	Yes I can't stand it. I'm not a bitch about it nor have I ever forced anyone to shave. If other people are making up random assumptions instead of asking more about my opinion and how I handle, that is 7 kinds of not my problem. Didn't realize I needed to defend myself.	9
0	It's going to be amazing. Either you'll see something you love, or you'll be able to start making a list of non-negotiables! Win-win!	9
0	I also agree but the "you're way overweight" thing also irks me	9
1	"Good idea! Maybe when he gets home from work I can bake him an apple pie, hand him his pipe and slippers, and then go puke in the bathroom so I can slim into a snappy new dress to!"  But no seriously, Doctor/Vet combo sounds unbeatable. Saving the world from all the things!	9
1	Oh yeah, I know boys and girls that were straight up abandoned/kicked out for coming forward and saying a relative or friend of the family molested them; it breaks my heart. My brain scarcely comprehends me or my parents ever being that way, it's just a level of cruelty beyond reckoning.	9
1	That's cute! I wish that would be our world as well.   On a similar note last week I was sitting on the toilet and saw that I had gotten my period, but had no pads or tampons near. So I called for my bf to bring me a small pad and he came to the toilet with EVERY pack of pads and tampons (arms full) I had in my drawer and said "I didn't know which you wanted so I just brought everything". So sweet.	9
0	sad "white man" is like a curse word now. downvoted to hell.  was just sincere question. nevermind	9

1	It was both of ours first time. We both plan on trying again, but I was just wondering if there was anything I could do to make the next time successful. We both knew it was supposed to be slightly painful, but it seemed that this was far too painful for her to be practical.	9
1	Haha, oh god, that is a great analogy. The funny part is that it came up because I told him about a guy who actually made a living on social media by posting crappy memes &amp; stuff, getting popular and then getting paid by sponsors to promote their crap. His response was he wouldn't want to deal with the SJWs... .wait what? THAT is the first thing you think of?	9
1	This is just further proof that you're an engineer at heart! And congrats! My best friend was one of two women in that graduated civil several years ago. It took her 5 years just to get the one degree, so that's incredibly impressive! I know just one can be stressful so you're awesome for taking on two!	9

1	What was so arousing about it?	9
0	Never said he purposefully disregarded it, but accidentally is still a problem--it makes no difference to your vagina whether the poop covered dick was there intentionally or not. I also didn't say to never forgive him--I just said to make him feel bad, meaning that as soon as he does actually feel bad, OP should then stop making him feel bad and move on.	9
0	I don't know, I thought ROK was an MRA/MGTOW/TRP type site. "Manosphere" sorts of things.  Then again, I guess I'm not that well-versed on the minute distinctions.	9
1	Huh, they skipped over 2000s...	9
0	That....was actually funny and really on point! They also made a version with no f-bombs for educational purposes; that's awesome! If I do a sex ed program/lecture/conference again I'll definitely work this in somewhere (with credit to the creator of course).   Thank you for this /u/The_Vork!	9
1	Aaaaaaaaaand racist. Can't say I didn't see that coming.	9
1	Or in the case of OP, they won't accept "I'm taken" because "I don't like the guy you're dating, so you shouldn't be dating him."	9
0	Yeah, it's a bit of a stretch to sell a movie (produced, written and directed by men) starring a **straight-white-cis-man** that saves women from their lives as **sex slaves** as some piece of feminist propaganda; no matter how scrappy the lady sidekick is or how many feminist authors consult on the supporting characters (read: human MacGuffins). If this is Hollywood pandering to women's rights, just ug.	9

0	They had a shitfit because people called them out on their shitty attitude  And theeeeeen they went off the deep end, threatening to kill themself because they were getting downvoted  Just some major histrionics	9
0	Go read the other side of it again.  She said he wasn't a bad guy, just fucked up and she still considered them friends.  This wasn't your call to make, it was hers.  You took that out of her hands by drama-bombing the entire thing.  &gt; I have this handled just fine  Fucking over strangers on the Internet?  Seriously, aside from the original issue, the hypocrisy here astounds me.	9

0	Yeah... plopping down a 2 weeks's notice with the heads up that you've been offered a job paying more elsewhere will have a magical effect on the purse strings. They will open like the horny legs of a teenager on prom night.   The way to get a raise is to be willing to _leave_. Either the company you're with finds the money or you jump into a job that already does.	9

1	Despite living in the south (Arkansas) I really thought it was sort of an isolated problem.  My parents certainly never used it, or said anything racist, nor did any of their friends.  I remember one incident when I was in 8th grade where a kid made a derogatory comment about the way the black people smell.  It was like a huge deal and he got suspended.  But that was really my only experience with racism until then.  I'd never even heard the N word except for on TV or whatever until I started taking my niece places and occasionally someone would call me a "nigger lover."  It was a shock to me.	9

0	I don't get why people are getting so upset here. The dude clearly was shaming women with pubic hair (I've personally heard drunken rantings of a guy who said this) and OP simply heard that he has a penis on the small side, and she is just tickled by the irony that HE is JUDGING women when he himself is not "perfect" and clearly OP's friend was no satisfied with his abilities, small dick or no.	9

0	While this isn't popular among a younger generation, I always try to respect the traditions of whoever is having me over.  For example, I might not agree with another religion, but if someone asked me to take my shoes off at the door of a temple I would.   You can always have different rules in your own home :)   I'm also assuming some level of context here- if they are telling you this as though you should be agreeing with them, well, react accordingly. But if it's general advice for where to sit, especially in more traditional settings, it's still true.	9
1	Thank you!  I'm sorry your family did this to you as well.  I'm probably just being overly sensitive about it, but it stings a little.  I'm the first person in my family to graduate college, so I thought they'd be excited/proud! Maybe not.  Oh well, I'll be excited and proud of me!	9
0	TBH, I feel like unless you are making her cum pretty often, you can't really complain about not enjoying sex as much with a condom on, though I do agree that I hate condoms, they smell bad and irritate me, but from a woman 's POV, it's a silly argument.	9
1	Can we just talk about how awful it is to not be able to use tampons? I couldn't for yearrrssss (until I started treatment for my vulvodynia, which spell check is telling me isn't a word, *wtf*).	9
0	I think they still could've done it. Not like they aren't rolling in the dough there.	9
0	I personally dont disrespect people, and if I find myself in situations causing me to lose my cool then that means I should rethink subjecting itself to those situations.	9
1	If there were a lot of negative comments in the thread, or if I were feeling uncharitable, or if he had a bunch of additional comments telling us how ladies be on their periods... Why do we do what we do?	9
0	The people that don't grow out of their dumb get worse, it's true.	9
1	Hey cupcakes! If you're buying from Lush, the whole no animal testing, minimal animal byproduct, and safe synthetics in minimal amounts thing is the reason you aren't finding more musky/masculine smells. Occasionally we try our hand at the safe synergetic musk... But it's to make our candy scented holiday shower gel. :S if you're looking for something more earthy and gender neutral try Big Blue, Granny Takes A Dip, and Blackberry (for starters). :) you can also find more interesting scent combos in the bubble bars- they just won't fizz like the bombs.	9
1	Assholes. Didn't even see who it was as he slipped into the crowd. I first thought it was my husband and when I said like "hey, come on we're in public" and he didn't know what I was talking about. Then I'd realized what happened and felt embarrassed and angry, and people around us must've seen it. It wasn't really super crowded. Still makes me kinda feel gross all over all these years later.	9
1	ouch ouch ouch ouch squished boob alert 0_0	9
0	Can't brain anymore. :/	9
0	This is the gif I needed in my life, and that is a super uncomfortable situation :(	9
0	Sooo many well spoken, tall women commenting in this thread. And they're all complaining about things I'll never experience first-hand.  Like, never.	9
1	Unfortunately this depends on the policy you get through the marketplace and is not an Obamacare-wide thing.  Nuvaring is not covered on my marketplace plan :(  http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/08/22/342400717/insurers-refuse-to-cover-some-contraceptives-despite-health-law	9
0	I dont get the downvotes, there is a healthy way to do this in moderation. I use opiods regularly on a recreational level. Really helps me relax and be a better person.	9
0	I would too. Minus Jennifer Lawrence.	9
0	Am I being paranoid or is this post (in the context of the backlash against menstrual cups post earlier today) seem a little bit corporate.   Why are you specifically talking about Divacups and giving very excellent user advice..    /R/hailcorporate	9
0	Until he was on it though, it's a worry, not a given.	9
0	This! I was first introduced to this kind of sexism from Beauty and the Beast, and once I learned how to notice it I started to freak the hell out. Now I can barely watch tv and movies anymore because of how much sexism there is. It's literally all over the place! (example: look up the Bechdel test, it's surprising how many movies don't pass it)	9
0	It's things like this that's always made me relieved I was straight. So much less relationship drama. My friends liked to play six degrees of sexperation at parties. (My friend group included one or two very complex poly relationships and just about every type of gender and sexual identity and persuasion there could be. Being straight and identifying as your assigned gender was a rarity. I think there were...three of us.)	9
1	You'll dye your hair for a random stranger when Santino wins a sewing competition and Visage wears a fucking turtleneck! Toots for the Bianca reaction gif, always love seeing them here.	9
0	So do I! They have some really awesome things you can't get anywhere else.	9
0	Past 12am on Thursday, so it seemed ok...?	9
1	Did you know that the female rapper in that song is actually Positive K with a higher voice? I was kind of impressed when I found that out.	9
0	bruh.. s/he's giving you genuinely helpful advice, you don't have to accept it but you don't have to act like a teenager either      that gif belongs on /r/shittytumblrgifs lol	9
0	Am I the only one that sees no problem with this? Its just a seat. No one is saying that you're less of a person for not being the male head of the household. They are just saying that this is his seat and not to sit there. Sure, its super traditional but I don't see an issue.	9
0	I think that's inherently part of it but doesn't negate that it's still a good "subconscious sexist assumptions test."   Consider this scene: A father and son are in a car accident and the father dies on scene. The son is brought to the hospital.  End scene.  Where does your mind go? Does your mind allow the thoughts of 'oh, the mother must be so sad losing her husband and son!' ? Mind does. Point being that the mention of the word "father" can sometimes make you think of the corresponding mother, and not just make you only think of men. It all depends on context.	9
1	Yeah, I'd never put nair in that area. I used it once and it burned a spot on my leg, so I'm really not a fan of that stuff.	9
0	Surely your sister is the one who will be mad at you for shaving your head?  Aren't you going to be in her bridal party soon?	9
1	I have to disagree. OP made her feelings clear - that she didn't want to pursue a relationship with him-and he responded by disregarding her boundaries and getting pissed about her polite decline of a relationship. At that point she's entitled to tell him to GTFO, in whatever manner accomplishes the goal.  His subsequent meltdown proves her instincts were correct on this one - burn that bridge with fire.	9
0	Always. :) &lt;3	9
1	I've had a pixie for almost six years now. I highly recommend it to everyone. Any decent hairdresser will be able to give you a cut that flatters you specifically.	9
0	I think it's standard in military and police, but other than that...	9
1	You did the right thing!	9
1	Gelato, but with chocolate mousse!	9
1	Yes! Me too! Everyone always laughed when I didn't want to hold a baby, like I was making a joke.   I really don't. Not only do I know I'd drop the thing and it wouldn't land properly, like a cat, but I'm pretty sure they don't have souls yet.	9
1	Just try to imagine the most racist things someone could possibly come up with in their wildest imagination to say about a white woman who dates a black man.  Then realize that whatever you just imagined isn't half as fucked as what the actual urban dictionary definition says because there's no way you're as racist as whoever wrote it.	9
0	Might be because no one plays like this, guy or girl. Talking in PvP is already pretty rare, let alone the amount of trash talking these supposed "male gamers" do. Wouldn't this be more appropriate to troll the trolls rather than just "male gamers"?  Furthermore, the footage is from Xbox yet she's using a PS4 controller that's not even turned on. Huh.	9
1	I decided that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was my hero when I saw her nodding off at this year's State of the Union address. She later admitted she was dozing off because she was a little bit drunk. I was proud of her for doing what she was going to do and not giving a fuck about it. One day I hope to also achieve the precious glory of not giving a fuck.	9
0	Ah, so a condom can't ruin a moment but a women condom can?	9
1	To sum it up, it's a slur for a (rich?) white girl who dates black guys to piss her parents off.	9
1	Am I the only one who thinks "when are you having kids?" is a super personal question? Like, damn homie take a step back away from my ovaries! Ugh. I hate it.	9
0	actually, _you're_ can be a contraction of "you are" _or_ "you were", since both end in -re.   In an ambiguous context like this one, I generally find it best to avoid using the contraction for exactly this reason, but it's not incorrect.	9
1	http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m16f82acbY1r7tqfmo1_400.png  Me as I look through the website.	9
1	Awww; you should still get one at some point, screw nana! I know it's not much consolation from some internet comment, but I *know* you can rock a good dress and look cute!	9
0	For me it sounds like a great way to end up vomiting everywhere lol	9
1	If my husband cheated on me and I didn't find out just because ”ehh,” the other girl didn't ”feel like it”... I can't tell you how much more pain that would cause me. It would be incredibly easy to do, and it could save another wronged woman that much more heartache.	9
1	&gt;I need sauerkraut at the end of the day to go with all that sausage.   Can you be my sister?	9
1	[So moist](http://www.ruralramblings.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/02-08-10_llama-face_8175.jpg)	9
1	"I'm not interested" once wasn't enough.  "I'm not interested" twice wasn't enough.  "Okay you've annoyed me to such a degree with your delusion that you force me to be honest. I'm not attracted to you" (I find your body type disgusting)  You push and push and push someone, and they'll snap back. Come on now.	9
0	Why *I* decided to "stick my nose into something that's not my business?!?"  Listen to yourself.	9
0	It doesn't matter.  Don't underestimate these animals.  This isn't Disney, they are not your friends.  They are not friendly or happy, they just are.  Especially the Lemur.  Do everything the zookeeper says, no more, no less.   Good luck.	9
1	As a Brit, having Chris Evans holding my breasts is not an attractive selling point.	9
1	Welcome to engineering.... =/  Man, I used to think I was smart until I started engineering!	9
0	I read that years ago!	9
0	Using male/female is vaguely dehumanizing. "Females" applies equally to women as it would to hens. Woman directly includes "human" as part of its definition.  Mixing the other way around has the same effect applied to men.  Using BOTH female and male is vaguely dehumanizing, but equal, so probably okay (but honestly kinda weird anyway).	9
0	ugh why do people do that? it's fucking downright mean! does no one follow the golden rule anymore?!  he was an ass	9
0	It's the best feeling ever. I love when my boyfriend plays video games and I get to watch. It's so much better than tv!	9
1	Both times I read Kajiji as Kajiht. I think I have a Skyrim addiction.	9
0	Oh buu-huu. I haven't had any friends in over a decade now. Don't worry, you'll get used to it.	9
0	Noooooo! I hope the relationship falls apart by itself since you aren't in a position to do anything.. Should stick to drugs without physical addiction :/	9
1	Update: the son of a bitch just informed me he's actually married. I would have liked to have known that.    Debating re-activating my profile just do I can screenshot his and send it to his wife who I just found on FB. They have a baby too.	9
1	I wasn't either. I didn't even know what some of that meant, but I think that's for the best.	9
0	Well, they said he had a strong campaign performance as leader, which isn't quite the same thing.   Christ, what a spot for labour. Can't appeal to Nationalists because UKIP and the SNP are eating their lunch, can't appear to the White Van Man because they still get painted as elitist, can't appeal to middle and upper classes because they're not taxy-cutty enough... I'm not extremely knowledgeable about British Party Politics, but Imma go ahead and blame Blair for abandoning the idea of a Labour party being for workers, and they've never recovered.	9
1	&gt; I....I just can't.   That was my immediate reaction. The level of stupidity and naivety is just beyond me. She's a goddamn teenager! She was walking home from *work* at 6:30, which isn't even that late, on a bridge that isn't far from a busy road. But how dare she, right? Obviously the solution is a curfew or maybe even the removal of women from the world altogether. I just don't think we're doing enough to shelter ourselves from psychopaths.	9
1	&gt; men whose index and ring fingers are similar in length tend to be nicer to women.  [Perhaps, but on the other hand...](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/MensHealth/penis-size-linked-finger-length/story?id=13999229)	9
1	Well, at least she's got a good excuse to always be allowed to ride shotgun in that car from now on instead of having to get in the back seat.	9
1	Pro tip: TrollX hates sentences that start with "as a guy". Plus your flair is kind of offensive, unless you're actually trans.	9
1	There's always going to be some idiot holding us back.	9
1	Beer nerds love to deny the fact that sexism is prevalent in beer culture. Like, no, that shit is everywhere. It doesn't have to be a naked woman on a bottle of beer to be sexist, but that happens as well.	9
0	I'm not really into cuddles anyway. My FWB is and it kind of freaks me out, cause I don't think of him in any cuddly kind of way, but even when I just let the spooning happen... I dunno, I just disconnect the entire thing from my emotions I guess.	9
1	&gt; I thought girls were supposed to be nice.  That WAS nice.  You don't know what I wanted to say.	9
1	I totally agree. I really wish we'd focus on the horrible things fedoras like this guy do rather than mocking them for their appearance. I get that it's cathartic sometimes and I'm not saying by any means that they don't deserve rudeness,  but if we're just perpetuating other forms of oppressive behaviour when we're calling out oppressive behaviour, that doesn't achieve much imo	9
1	What's taboo for guys is to be emotionally open and supportive, so that's what there is a lot of in TrollY.  When it's looking for sympathy when something bad happens people call it a pity party.  When it's looking for a high five when something good happens, people come in and accuse it of being a bragging sub.	9
0	Secretly I was hoping for the Ontario near LA... Why does it have to be the real Ontario? *cries for the unpet foxes*	9
0	Welpppp Im done with the internet for the day	9
1	Awww; may it rain dildos and vibrators with little parachutes over your dwelling. &lt;3	9
1	If we all hate each other why are all the lady-centric subs and internet spaces so friendly and supportive?  Oh wait, I forgot we're all backstabbing two faced bitches.	9
1	"I enjoy spending time with you a lot and wanted to know how you feel about us becoming exclusive".  It's really not as painful as you're psyching yourself up about, I promise.  You can bite the bullet and do this, you're strong, you got this.	9
1	i mean this in the nicest possible way:  can you please just get fucked?  i'm sure you will soon.	9
0	So he's not your ex-boyfriend yet? Kudos for being a forgiving person.	9
1	People shouldn't buy homes because it's just asking to get robbed	9
0	as though reminding you of this fact will make you more aware of it? jesus, how unnecessary.	9
1	[Like a boss.](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/03/09/article-1364750-004EA27000000258-403_634x338.jpg)  But seriously she's sort of awesome with the horses. [Here she is ](http://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/royals/2011/05/31/photos_all_the_queens_horses/gallopingsurprise.jpeg.size.xxlarge.letterbox.jpeg) on a race horse in 1961.  And [here she is](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01841/queen_1841224c.jpg) riding with Ronald Reagan.	9
1	My iud was covered 100% by my insurance. This should have come sooner. I only wish Obamas bigger health care laws had been passed.	9
1	&gt; Delusional of him to say that he refuses to believe that one person can have feelings for someone without them feeling the same way back.  It's also incredibly narcissistic and disrespectful.   "MY emotions nullify you as an adult capable of making your own choices. My emotions automatically dictate yours."	9
1	pro tip: get some scissors and trim it a bit before you start to shave! makes it faster and less painful after not doing it for a while	9
1	Dude, yes. Or you get a bitchin hand cramp	9
0	Don't worry, it probably didn't actually happen. OP had another post 5 days ago about how she met her bf in  an online bondage forum. So either that was a lie, or this is. Or this is just something she grabbed from r/niceguys, which also means it probably isn't real.	9
0	From one of those women, I'm sorry. I'm under 5'2" and my SO is around 6'4".	9
1	Arsenic is all natural. Sounds like this guy could use a dose! See how he feels about "natural" stuff then.	9
1	I think its because tumbler really restrictive rules on gif uploads. (No larger than 1 MB, no wider than 540px)	9
0	Oh I will be, I'm so blessed.	9
1	You can just tell her it's like Tina Fey's diary.	9
0	Guy here. Saw this and me and my overwhelming sense of curiosity for all things medical looked up a colposcopy procedure on youtube. Now I just have another thing to add to my list "Reasons I'm glad I'm a guy, because I'm too much of a wimp to put up with anything women do."	9
0	Did you blame him for how he acted in your head?	9
0	I respect your opinion but I think we don't share it.   You're right, he needed to change in order to find love,  and he did.  But come on the part when she saves him from the pack of wolves back in the castle he blames her for the attack, whaaaat?   then he tells her that the library is all for her *if* she stays, umm OK.	9
0	I do feel that this is a pretty hasty generalisation as plenty of guys treat women well	9
1	It's not really our place to judge what other people think romantically about obese people. Her saying he was disgusting didn't come out of thin air. This was clearly about romantic boundaries, and someone can certainly find another person disgusting because of their appearance.	9
0	&gt; douche  Also an option	9
1	You basically described my man. Although he cries when I bring it up though...	9
1	It is pretty freaky. The dress code for women says "Clothing is immodest when it is sleeveless".	9
1	You're beautiful. Also I don't know how [this went over my head for so long](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/reverse.gif)	9
0	And the Hitachi Magic Wand is literally a muscle massager! But lets be honest here, we're among friends.	9
1	Every time I see that banana i feel like its flapping its little peels!	9
1	Don't worry /u/iRayneMoon, there are dozons of us! 😀	9
0	Really? I guess it doesn't come through here but I was thinking this more in a half funny, half serious conspiratorial tone...like "hey this is a serious issue, but here's a way to deal with it that might be a little fun for you since you had to go through all that." Clearly completely hysterical over here.	9
0	Hell yes! The copay on mine was like $20, I figured that was more than reasonable for 5 years of babby repellent.	9
1	My mom is going to therapy (I hope) for things that happened to her as a child. She didn't even realize she needed it until I told her over Christmas.   Take your time, but most therapist you'd see are SUPER nice and understanding and you don't have to take any medicine you don't want to. Not that they would suggest medicine, but don't let it stop you.	9
0	The vagina is acidic which is why I was talking about acids.	9
1	My sister posted this email that someone sent her. I think the dude is some sort of psychologist? That's what a Facebook comment said.   We had a good laugh about it, especially the college bit. I'm a lady engineering student and am so vastly outnumbered in my classes that I need sauerkraut at the end of the day to go with all that sausage.	9
1	[Fuck yes!](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/01/tech/12-inspirational-quotes-from-women/)	9
0	SAME. I love my sweet TayTay. Also I'm so glad I'm not the only one that calls her that.	9
0	I think you're giving a lot of people too much credit by assuming such an implication is intentional.	9
0	I didn't really care for how they damselized her in the latest movie...	9
1	Hmm... Pretty sure that's ducks.	9
1	I thought that I'm at college to get my degree and educate myself. Recently my friends informed me that they go to college to find a husband. I didn't get a memo. Too bad.	9
1	And when you check back hours later and there's no reply... fuuuuuckk	9
0	In England its not that scary to go to uni, student loans pay for tuition, everyone gets extra for living etc. We don't have to pay it back until were out of uni and earning over 21,000 a year, and even then its only 9% of your wage. I think that here, its more because people think its unlikely that you'll find it hard to make a wage from your degree and you'll end up wasting it and working in something unrelated.	9
0	I know but you can still be tricked into giving pizza.	9
1	This is the worst. I was on a spring break weekend last year without my SO and a few guys wanting to hit on me said things like "he doesn't know, right?" WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?	9
0	Aaagh, title typo! Well... it doesn't matter. I look freakin' FABULOUS, and this will hopefully stop the nervous peeling.	9
0	Get the fuck away from me, creep.	9
1	Blasphemy! They're only perfectly sweet when lightly spotted ^^^dick.	9
0	yeah totally. it's a reference to brutal prison rape. people don't like knowing that words mean things beyond what they want them to.	9
1	[Body shaming sub?](http://imgur.com/fq2c2ZA)	9
1	He is so delightfully tan in person. I secretly wondered if he tasted like a cinnamon latte.	9
0	I'm curious, why you go for FWB and not straight up relationship?  And it's just my personal experience, but in exclusive FWB settings feelings tend to come up eventually, so be careful about that. Either by not being exclusive or setting good groundrules, you could avoid that, though.	9
1	Context? You mean like the century+ that the word has been used as a derogatory insult and way to dehumanize and demean a group of people to support their systemic oppression?	9
1	Lol I find that fascinating because people talk about doing that and I'm such a heavy sleeper that the idea of farting myself awake is...weird. I think for me to do that, it would decimate my bed and maybe take out a couple walls. Your SO sounds *adorable*!	9
0	But, you have a wife. Why go out? Isn't that the point?	9
0	Why is this comment not at the top yet?	9
0	True, that is how the conversation was _supposed_ to be going (which is an _entirely_ different debate altogether), but it seems like everyone took the non sequitur and ran with it. Even though the headline isn't what the main point of the discussion was supposed to be, the man said it on the national news. It cannot be ignored.	9
0	Idk, but it makes me want to gag.	9
0	Sure, linguistsplaining, since annoyingly explaining word usage is a common characteristic of linguists.   Or tumblrsplaining (if I was actually on tumblr) since explaining oppression is a common thing tumblr people do.   Explaining vaginas is not a common thing trans people do, so the splaining has nothing to do with her being trans.	9
0	yea same here, hoped that this place would not be so sexist. Now when its on + i regained my hope for that	9
1	I would kill to look like Samantha at 52 wowzahs	9
1	If my Catholic mother found out the horrible things I get up to in the bedroom, I think it would be easier to move country than to ever see her again.	9
1	no no semen--&gt; vagina, not urethra. you cannot PEE OUT semen!	9
1	Ugh, idk why I do too. Maybe its because I want their lavish lifestyle minus the cameras. Lol. I remember I used to watch the hills, real housewives, the....i should stop typing now.	9
0	I first saw this ten years ago on the Internet, and I facepalmed. I still do.	9
1	You look so cute!! The shorter hair just looks fantastic and I can totally picture you with a pixie cut! You are so owning that look!	9
0	You aren't ordering a meal here, these are people.	9
1	That's when you just hang up and block. Because nobody has time to deal with that bullshittery.	9
1	Right? Don't you people have shit to do.	9

1	Do you have a different Victoria's Secret than the rest of us? Not only is all their advertising geared towards men, but their bras are also built for aesthetics rather than comfort or practicality, their employees are not trained in how to properly fit bras, and every one I've ever met has been extremely rude.  Oh, there's also the fact that VS was actually created with men in mind in the first place. The whole point was to make a lingerie store where men wouldn't feel awkward shopping.	9
0	Oh good else the excitement would be confusing...	9
1	And don't forget, if you are interested and respond too eagerly, you're a whore!  Whatever the outcome, you're in the wrong and there's a shitty name for you.	9
0	Like I said, I don't intend to put his job down, I only mentioned it to show what he was doing.   I don't know why people keep mentioning the money. I get that typically artists are known for living in borderline austerity, so maybe people are trying to say his work is better because he has money?  My work will involve re-socialising people, helping people with depression, possibly helping to avoid suicide. Honestly I would call that work more fulfilling than repair work. Maybe thats just me.	9
1	Trust me, if I had the money to wax I would be all over it	9
0	Nice!    We've been 9 years pill free here.  Vasectomy is awesome.  (his choice...)	9
1	You said that really well, I'll probably steal it. I agree 100%. I always laugh when people talk about "unnatural chemicals", like wtf is an unnatural chemical? Everything comes from something, they just only extract the parts they need and mix it with other things to get the desired results.  I don't know if that made sense.. I'm so tired I can't words.	9
1	I always like to think that those kind of statements reflect more on the person saying them than the person they are directed at.   If it were me, I'd totally to the brush-off approach. "Why do you care so much about my eating habits?", "Wow that was rude.", and "Yeah, stop obsessing over my food habits, it's not cool."	9
0	I haven't actually read Pride and prejudice. I can give it a shot tho. I bet someone else did it already....It was like, a thing on Twitter yesterday. Hash tag clickbaitbooks	9
0	When I was an undergraduate and needed something ironed I'd do cutesy puppy eyes at the nearest woman and helplessly flail around with the iron in front of her until she stepped in and did it for me.  I'm actually competent and quick at ironing, I just prefer making cheery small talk while watching someone else to actually doing it.   In my defence, I was cute enough to get away with it and that doesn't last forever. Make hay while the sun shines and all that.  edit: Still got it! Did bwinky bwinky eyelash fluttering at wife, persuaded her to wash my duvet cover.	9
1	He does this if I'm distracted. We're watching TV or a movie and he gets us a drink or snack, and I hold out my hand while still watching TV. Then I feel balls. He's all pleased with himself.	9
0	You are a reasonable person. For a lot, not the man but his money is very welcome.	9
1	Honestly, I think that's better. Men need to learn that there are reasons other than "belonging to" another dude that we're not interested in them. I usually just say "no thanks." When pressed I say "I"m just here to hang with friends." When pressed further I say "I am not interested, please leave me alone." And finally comes the "dude, just FUCK OFF."	9
0	Quick! Someone fire a TrollX invite to the author, stat!	9
0	"white men" was in the title , an not needed detail put there. i asked the OP , and they replied with direct answer. so why you are going on is beyond me. sorry to be rude but I'm going to ignore you	9
1	You are a superstar and someone will love you again and treat you like the princess you are. Remember that.  Now, see if you can use this sucky sucky heartbreak as a fire to keep you motivated. He already hurt you, don't let him rob you of good marks too!! Throw yourself into this work and prove how much of a strong lade you are by aceing your projects. I believe in you!!	9
0	I'm guilty of doing something like that (but hopefully not as aggressively). When a girl says she's not interested, guys can sometimes change her mind and get her to give him a chance. Everyone knows that couple that's perfectly happy but the girl rejected the guy the first time. But when a girl says she has a boyfriend, she's taken and there's no way you can change her mind.  But that's just how I feel about it. Maybe most guys do only respect women if they're another man's "property."	9
1	HE'S SO BIG. WHEN I MET HIM HE MADE THE COFFEE CUP HE WAS HOLDING LOOK LIKE AN ESPRESSO SHOT. LIKE HOLY SHIT. OK IM DONE.	9
0	That's super sleezy.	9
0	No one benefits from you being an asshole either :D	9
0	The thread was specifically about genital mutilation. The article  happened to focus on women, but that doesn't mean genital mutilation of all kinds has no place in the discussion.   You're mad because you think men hijacked a thread that was "supposed" to be about women. The way I see it, you went to a thread about genital mutilation and got mad that someone posted about the *wrong kind* of genital mutilation. It doesn't make sense to me.	9
0	I've gotten a lot of answers to my question but this is probably the most fair answer.  I mean, a lot of the other ones made good points, but this is the most unbiased assessment.	9
1	You need to pull a "Hey I just met you, and this is crazy..." on him!	9
0	YEah, it is. Nobody wants to see that shit.	9
0	Best way to put it.	9
1	I may have screamed a little when I got to the baby otters &gt;.&gt;	9
0	I've only seen this once by a lady at a bar. I think she'd had too much to drink.	9
0	What does this mean? D:	9
0	It's because no body wants to listen to rock music from the 80s. It's literally garbage.	9
0	I'd use "boy toy" over "faux bae." The latter sounds too young for me. But do what you want. :)	9
1	Yay Rudy! Does Build-a-Bear make clothes for all the animals? I only had a bear. If so, you should let Rudy rock some kick ass outfits and shoes.   And yay you! Take care of your lovely self and remember that you did what you needed to do *for you*, which is all that is important. And us trolls are always here to support you.	9
1	Kim is a goddess. No shame.	9
0	I'm just so confused what OP was thinking they'd see. Her in saris? Bollywood outfits?	9
0	You've never accompanied them to work.	9
0	&gt; that sadly lost her little boy, I'm surprised she's not banned from here.  It wasn't anything against OP, just the commenters who decided they had nothing better to do than attack the way I expressed my condolences. :/	9
1	Guys "get" the girl in movies and stories and all that when they "prove" their love, whereas girls are "won."  It's a weird trope when you think about it for a second.	9
0	There's wanting to be treated like a human and then there's #killallmen. Pick one.	9
1	But blues a boy colour.	9
1	Life will be so much better now!  This sounds just like the 8 year marriage I had in my 20's.  It took awhile to deprogram myself..  but it's all a fuzzy faded memory now and life is better than I could have imagined for myself.  And some good comes out of these terrible relationships ya know, because we learn what we will never ever put up with again, and we also learn just how strong we are for getting out because that's the hardest part.  Then you can channel that strength into something awesome!!  I am really happy for you!  Breathe easy and be yourself!  &lt;3	9
1	Oddly enough, drilling into the actual product page reveals that apparently everyone except for people who wear size M have bought it. Although maybe they only made like one of each size.  [Here's](http://www.ae.com/aerie/browse/product.jsp?productId=7495_9096_178&amp;catId=cat5020120) the unfortunate thing.  Also, a mini PSA that the 7 panties for $27 is a thing right now.	9
1	Sometimes, the worst breakups, you do all your mourning and \*aching-for long before you cut the cord.  Sucky to lead up to, but it's pretty much sweet freedom from that point. :D	9
1	I'm not sure what US brand you wear, but 30F US for a lot of brands is equivalent to a 30E in UK sizing, which you can find for much less than that and with free shipping online! For example, [the black version of this bra](http://www.amazon.com/Cleo-Womens-Minnie-Balconnet-Orange/dp/B00JR9TY8E/ref=sr_1_41?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430533638&amp;sr=1-41&amp;keywords=30e+bra) is only $16 right now, with free shipping and returns (though Cleo bands run somewhat tight, especially compared to US bras, so you might want to try a 32DD as well).	9
0	Thankfully you have the option to open links in your inbox, so, eh.  If I get an imgur link in my inbox with few other words, or "Do you wanna see my PUPPY?" yeah, I know better.	9
0	You can even have it on consecutive days, maybe. Just not the same day if that's not your thing!	9
1	Those spaghetti holder need to be colored in blue. That would be amazing.	9

1	If I were this girl, it would take every inch of my will not to send this guy a snapchat video of me getting absolutely plowed by this Alex guy. It would be the perfect burn.	9

1	I am the manager.    With most industries, I'd agree with you, but I work at an independent bookstore.  Even with both the owners working for free, we barely break even. Every time they scape together a bit of a raise, I'm thankful.  We're having an unexpectedly fabulous year, hence the 10%.    Edit for typo	9
1	This troll understands the ins and outs of okay!	9
0	/u/shittywatercolour - *she* is British.	9
0	If you, a woman, has a straight, single, male friend... they want you. At the least, they want to have sex with you. It's as simple as that. Sometimes this applies to non-single guys too!	9
1	OMFG I nearly spit out my coffee.	9
0	Ugh, I hate when that happens! My ex would just be dismissive of my feelings as "emotional reasoning." Like, what?!	9
0	I'm sure you have a better insight on her personal life experiences than she does.	9
1	I put some purple in my hair and sent a picture of it to the guy I'm seeing asking if he liked the color purple. His response was "Yeah but the important thing is if you like it". I was actually taken aback, and then immediately got super turned on....	9
0	But they're not married.	9
0	&gt; UPDATE #2: It's just come out that the girl's allegation was false. No explanation as to why since she apparently hadn't named anybody, just provided descriptions. Hell, it's not even clear if she was the one who filed the complaint.  This should really be the top comment.	9
1	firstworldpolyproblems: Since I'm open about being polyamorous, saying I'm engaged doesn't mean much. I just have to ovary up and tell them no. As someone who hates confrontation and 'being mean' it's really hard! It's valuable for everyone to learn to do, though...	9
1	I can still appreciate a funny or excited post even if I can't relate. Usually the ones I can relate to I find funnier, though.   Idk, if everyone could relate to everyone else about everything, it'd be really boring. I'm glad I can't relate to everything. I get introduced to new things and get to see things from others' perspectives.   We're all humans. At least we can always relate on that note.	9
1	I'm graduating from veterinary medical school next week and I'm in contract negotiations for a job as a doctor. My school I wanted to go to the big university wide graduation with all the undergrads in the stadium that lasts all day in the hot sun. I straight laughed in their faces.  I have no time to get shitfaced with youths. I've got adult things to do like eat myself sick with my family at an expensive restaurant.	9
0	Cept they sex her up to over compensate her bad assness, like every female super hero :&lt; don't even want to talk about power girl. Yeah the guys look sexy too but their actions aren't using their sexy against people. Idk, just annoys me.	9
1	I always thought "not interested" to be the best reason. Reasons like "I'm not ready to date right now" are much more disappointing because they make it sound like it could have worked if it was a different time. At least with "not interested" it's like "Okay, well that's just the way it is".	9
0	Congratulations! Your doing fine.	9
0	And I'm one of those people who is **disproportionately** bothered by those on Reddit, who don't actually know either way, but must come shit on things by claiming them false, because gut feelings?  The desire to shit on things?  Kind of like how this woman shit on this little girl in Disneyland. This sub is my Disneyland. Why do you have to shit on it?	9
1	Look, so far as I can tell social norms today are "don't talk to any strangers because God forbid you meet someone" so I think I can safely say I don't understand them and feel pretty good about that.	9
0	Where does it say show me boob for pizza?   This looks like being used for pizza, not being tricked. And I'm against it. But used and tricked are not the same. The guy is using her as well and paying pizza for boobs is a pretty low price.	9
0	Whereabouts are you headed to?	9
1	11/10 perfect freaking response. I'm still feeling the sting from that BURN.	9
0	You are the best! Thanks so much for the link. See-ya I'm going shopping.	9
0	Why didn't you cram the makeup case into a bag or a box? Losing that sucks!	9
1	So if I have little boobs, will I be like a T-rex?	9
0	Talk away!  Sometimes this is the best therapy!	9
1	Yes, but no one should be held to the shit they did in the past for all time. I think the feminism thing is because her last video (and by last video I mean last one I saw because I have no clue what's cool right now) she kind of played with the media image of her being boy crazy and also just crazy and I think she might have said some things recently that would indicate she's cool with feminism.   I could be talking out of my ass however!	9
0	It will be a lot of late nights and help of the secret literary elf squad, but yeah :)	9
0	If I had to pay for four weddings I'd want to make it as cheap as possible too.	9
1	I LOVE that the "war on men" is like, not dating them and/or expecting them to pull their weight in relationships, while "the war on women" is passing legislation to restrict what we're allowed to do with our bodies. Same thing though, right?	9
0	(happy cake day, also yes I agree downvoting doesn't really help a situation at all)	9
1	Rudy gives zero fucks about other people's opinions and so should you! Internet hugs!	9
1	Shut up before I eat you.	9
0	But then you spent the next long while discussing it and getting congratulations about it	9
1	&gt; I don't think liking T. Swift and being feminist have to go hand in hand at all.  I know, I was just making a reference to the "also not related to feminism at all" quote from Mean Girls:   &gt; Irregardless, ex-boyfriends are just off limits to friends. I mean that's just like the rules of feminism.  If someone accused me of not being a feminist because I don't particularly like Taylor Swift's music, I'd have a good laugh, and then gently inform them that the two are not contingent on one another at all.	9
1	How many math classes at your university did you not take? I feel like this list would be shorter.	9

0	I think at this point it's considered a badge of honor here. Brave be our sisters who venture out of the safe zone of TrollX.	9

0	Removed for:  &gt;No posts about other subreddits, threads, or users.	9
0	Well... I mean, the love-story side plot isn't really for no reason and it was in the comics, just with a different character.  When you see AoU you'll see why it wasn't Hawkeye.	9
1	Yeah, don't you know that she used to fuck OP's boyfriend? That means that they're still having sex, so he should date Allie instead!	9
0	I think in some of the stories, stockholm is a lot more plausible (most of the stories have a lot less sentient furniture).	9

1	I just watched it yesterday too! IN 3D. I was so overwhelmed in the best way.	9
1	:( love you trollsister. Im sorry sweetie. *hugs*	9
1	The problem  is when the "status quo" includes things like men being ignored/not being taken seriously as rape victims or victims of domestic violence or the massive stigma  of showing emotion.   Equality shouldnt begin  with insulting and ignoring issues on the other side of gender inequality.  Gender issues impact both genders. This rampant ignorance  from both  sides doesnt help anything.	9
1	Clearly she is talking about his head. ;P	9
1	Why would any one think that's okay to ask?	9
1	I'm pretty sure women in the past, before stuff like Midol/general pain relievers, were like "god damn it, I wish there was a pill or something for this shit".	9
1	I'm pretty sure that not liking Taylor Swift is the first sign that someone is the anti-christ.	9
0	How rude. If the situation were different, I might tell his friends about his small dick, but there's too much potential for danger to do that.	9
0	Just think how fabulously thin the starving children  in Ethiopia are and how great it would be to look like that.	9
0	&gt; No shame in having a small dick. Not like it's his fault.  Shame? I don't know, that's kind of personal. But it's certainly much more important than whether a woman is shaved or not.	9
0	You're missing the point. It's not about comfort but more what's suitable for kids. Thongs wasnt't invented for comfort, it was invented for women to look sexier. Kids shouldn't look sexy, not even close. It's the same with high heels and make up. It's not suitable for children because it's not MADE for kids, it's made for grown women.	9
1	I wonder if I have ever been that happy?	9
1	Yeah. I don't drink or anything, and although I do wear makeup I've never been in a relationship at all, and I can't use tampons- but I do love lurking where people are talking about stuff I can't experience. It makes me feel like I'm missing out on less. You get to learn a lot!	9
1	Hah, the first thing he asked when he turned on the lights was "Are you on your period?!". But I'm on the pill, so I only ride the crimson tide when I choose to - and nights when I'm staying with the SO are not those nights!	9
1	Would likely make great pjs/house dress for shark week though!	9
0	OMG that alone would have made me rage! Nothing like a sexist asshole who reverts to age 6 when confronted. I would have loved to point out his behavior directly. "Why are you rolling your eyes? Wouldn't you consider that disrespectful if a student did that you to?"  Good for you for fighting the good fight.	9
1	Hey I just met you, and this is crazy, but your bum looks awesome, so call me maybe...	9
0	Sex is pretty stress relieving, but building up to it can be stressful, yeah. I don't place any value on virginity myself so I don't think that would be a bad way to lose it at all, but I understand if you do and want to save that moment for someone you're really into!	9
0	Yes this is the answer. ARE YOU HAPPY NOW GUYS?	9

0	I paid $2 delivery from Quality Foods and the groceries were priced the exact same in store like WTF. Get with the times, not everyone actually *can* leave the house and get food.  Like elderly people who are still able to live alone but aren't allowed to drive, and other disabled people. Ugh.  My excuse was I didn't have my license at the time so I had to bet delivery. Now. I just don't want to go out and deal with the bullshit.  Also makes it easier to judge the budget when you can *see* the total in the cart vs the OOOH look cocoa pebbles!	9

0	All words are invented; I'm just tell you how they are currently used in the community of people who use this particular word.   I'm not a prescriptivist so go ahead and use it however you want.   I'm a descriptivist so I was describing it's common usage.	9
0	its that very attitude of "fuck you and your expectations" that is taking average Americans nowhere. Your belief in an "individuals first" attitude is leaving people without the manners, looks or skills to function in a profitable workplace and thats why so many "alternative" people have to get alternative type jobs.	9
1	What's funny is I had been talking to my roommate about how we'd never farted in front of each other before that SAME day. He later told me that he thought he had in front of me, because on two separate occasions when I was sleeping over he farted himself awake.  he's a gem	9

0	It's ok to objectify female models and other people being hired for sex appeal? Funny saying that amid hundreds of posts in this damn subreddit saying how gross it is to do such a thing	9
1	Get out of here with that.	9
1	Omg I thought I was the only one who did that!!!   It's so silly, but I can't help it! I mean it'd not like he knows whether or not I look at my phone, but...Actually I'm not sure of the logic behind this.	9
1	Well they like to blame us for not taking every precaution imaginable to avoid being raped or assaulted and they like to tell us we can't be "paranoid" and just suspect that someone pursuing us is a threat, so, yeah, can't win. Guys could just not stalk us/creep on us, but let's not go blaming the people responsible now; that's just crazy!	9

0	I can't identify him as a feminist because he chooses his label, I don't. I tried telling him that he is basically a feminist, but he said that he is just a rational human being who doesn't think women are inferior. He shouldn't be forced to put the feminist tag on himself. (his words, not mine)	9
0	That's why there are abortions. Problem solved.	9
0	I LOVED the series. I was referring to the fact that the ships are alive and can pretty much sail themselves.   If you had a hard time with that, you probably don't want to hit her Rainwilds Chronicles. You get a decent amount of that with the character Thymara, but there IS a lot of empowerment, and regardless of the self pity, those two sets of books (Liveship Traders and Rainwild Chronicles) remain some of my very favorite books.	9
1	Holy shit yes. I have bigger thighs but a smaller waist, so I typically have to get a bigger size, for my legs. So then I need a belt.   If it's too tight, I get a muffin top, too loose and I get this popping sound when I walk, where the material rubs together on my legs and it kinda sounds like weird little farts. I can never get a belt that's just right.  I feel like goldilocks, but I can't find baby bear's stuff.	9
0	Men?  What about just this one.   Don't generalize please.	9
0	But vinegar and soap do kill germs.   I mean, it doesn't mean that they kill all germs, but I have never gotten sick from going ass-to-mouth as long as I cleaned out really well beforehand. The risk factor is there. I guess that is why it is sexy?	9
0	It is I insist on only receiving oral sex until I am married.  I am doing my part.  jk	9
0	I have this sinking feeling that you're Indian.   Edit: wow, I asked because OP said she isn't Middle Eastern, and I know a lot of Westerners mistake Indians for Middle Easterners. I was not trying to offend or imply anything.	9
1	I mean it comes from the ground, but honestly so do most medicines they're just refined or recreated in a lab. Sooooooooooooooo "yeah bro I was crying on my living room floor earlier. This is natural enough for me fucker."	9
1	You misunderstand. I'm not denying the problem I just don't like to be told I am responsible for some asshat to get away with something. If I can help I do but I will not sit here and be told that I'm the problem.	9
1	From one language geek to another, your flair is amazing...	9

1	You know how to pick 'em, literally.	9
0	If you don't feel like continuing the conversation, I'll cease it.  It seems like we have two different approaches to life. I look at everything through the individualism prism. To me, an individual is more valuable than a group as a whole.	9
0	Haha, my husband has a bit of a problem with this, so we made an agreement to keep his phone in the car while we're on a date. I'm going out to interact with him more, dangit!	9
0	Don't know why you were down voted. There a lot of people I don't respect because of the choices they've made.   Myself, for one. ;)	9
1	Yikes,that sub makes me cringe..	9
0	Yeah... there are several possible explanations for that. I suppose the most benign of them is that he is a twin himself and finally has someone who understands the weirdness that comes with being a twin.  Far more likely is that he thinks if he scores with you, it's like he got to see two women naked.	9
1	Nothing wrong with him having his own standards, but, yeah, that would be a "let's just be friends" moment for me. I couldn't imagine going over a year with no sex while dating someone, much less waiting until we're married to see how they are at it.	9
0	Yes, Urquhart would instead manipulate a chain of obligations and blackmail into causing the person to either jump in front of the train themselves or have a unwitting patsy do it. Or he'd arrange for them to be *driving* the train when it runs over an innocent disabled man, wrecking the opponent from the inside.	9
1	Yeah my Paragard implant wasn't that painful but really uncomfortable; physiology is everything. But it can be so painful that women pass out; I've heard that more than a few times. So it's not something to take lightly at all.	9
1	[Shhhhhhhhhh](http://i.imgur.com/m0kJ5Jl.gif)	9
1	I think often times a lot of guys don't know how to pivot in a conversation.  Coupled with the idea that they've completely disregarded the possibility that the other person isn't interested and you get this situation here. They're left flat footed and cornered animals tend to lash out.  Being able to show confidence when someone says no and continuing with pleasant conversation is a skill that a lot men aren't taught. That and learning to be comfortable dancing.	9

0	My guess is a dye job, but the lighting is so different between the two pictures that I'm not sure.  EDIT: Or did you get it cut? It looks shorter on the left. Which one is the before picture? I'M SO CONFUSED	9
1	Really depends on the kind of anime you watch. It's like saying: books don't know how to tell proper love stories because twilight doesn't tell a good love story.	9
1	Nice! Any recommendations for what I can do to keep him comfortable while he heals?	9
0	If you feel like crying, go ahead and cry.  Women's tears are like men's kryptonite. He will feel embarrassed and helpless, which frankly is already what you feel, and then you can be brave and rub it in his face when you find someone new who magically does not make you cry-- a task that he failed at, like a big stupid failure.  It's not manipulative, it's exactly how you feel.	9
0	Are you doing my dishes in return?	9
1	I love this, my husband does similar stuff as well and its always when I am gaming and trying to focus on something intense.  Sometimes he will just walk up and put his balls/dick on my shoulder and be like "whats up? whatcha doin'?". Or he will been standing off to the side, just where I can see out of the corner of my eye, and pull it out and start trying to helicopter it.	9
0	I've sorta done this in that I needed to stay up all night, and one of my activities to pass the time was chatting on Tinder, so I'd be like "you need to entertain me so that I stay awake".	9
0	So wait, do you get like, a special discount? Just have a personal preference? Are much wealthier? Is there any particular reason he doesn't buy them, or does it just work out like that?	9
0	I just get so sad, when the size of a community governs "what to talk about". I mean, we should be able to talk about whatever! But I guess that's "group mentallity" :/	9

1	Agreed, it's possible that he made some nasty shit up about OP to prevent them from talking.   But, even if she knows the whole story, she may not want to talk to OP. Situations like that are just awkward and difficult at best, it's understandable that she might want to avoid conversation.	9

0	That's awesome! Did you used to have problems getting an orgasm or getting it consistently?	9
1	Looks great! I think a pixie would look great on you.	9
0	Darling, that's a pretty dubious line of reasoning you're operating on.   You're imposing a very arbitrary distinction between when it is and isn't one's right to complain.	9
0	Okay killer, take it easy. :p	9
0	Because I am right? And people keep arguing shit I'm not talking about? Like now? I'm not arguing a complicated concept, here. You're the one trying to turn it into something else.	9
1	Only you can decide that.  Personally "invisible makeup that just makes you look flawless" and "very obvious makeup that makes you like a beautiful bird/clown/flower/beautiful-colorful-thing" are both totally valid and awesome skills. It still amazes me that I'm allowed to decide which or neither I prefer.	9
1	That is awesome that you're taking care of yourself and doing some self-pampering; that is just the best way to move on from that kind of thing and keep yourself motivated and in good spirits. I'm proud of you!	9
1	Total side note but it irks me that when a woman says she's not interested, it's never enough of a reason. So women say that they have boyfriends because another man will more likely respect the man she's dating rather than her own wishes. I know he didn't respect the other guy either - I just hate that "I'm not interested" isn't enough of a reason	9
1	I actually exclaimed "Thanks, Obama!" out loud the first time the pharmacist gave me my birth control with no co-pay (I had forgotten when it was going into effect).  The pharmacist looked at my like I was a crazy person, haha.	9
0	It wasn't her responsibility to fix anything... I am sorry if I gave that impression.  The admin was trying to sort out the issue and pulled her in because she was witness to several things and was trying to understand the baseline.  Apparently other parents had heard about the issue and called in.  It seems in her school, they acquire information and then deal with the issue at hand.	9
1	I don't know how to invest! I'm definitely going to learn, though. I've been able to figure out how to pay all of my bills, save up to move into a new apartment by the end of next month, and still have $500 of spending/savings/emergency fund left over *every month.* After a few months, I want to be able to make investments like a real adult!	9
0	that might work.  then again it is quite likely to drive her away into the arms of her boyfriend, make her depressed and make her shut down.  she would be much better off using gentle persuasion and maintaining open channels of communication.	9

0	I've been there.  Again and again.  And it gets so damn exhausting going through it again when you feel like you just dealt with all this shit.  I can't make it any better for you from here but I can say that I care and I support you and this shit will pass away.  It make takes its sweet time to move out of your life but it will.  And in the meantime, you are not alone.  If you need anything, just message and we can talk and get through it all.	9

0	I don't have any experience with pedophelia specifically but I just want to point out that people don't get to pick their fetishes. It isn't like the difference between orientation and fetish is that clear anyway, it wasn't that long ago that homosexuality was considered a paraphilia.  EDIT: That said, anyone with a destructive or harmful paraphilia should seek therapy ASAP. Just because it wasn't a choice doesn't make it okay.	9
1	Eh family... Reminds of one of my friend's grandmother who literally keeps a list of everyone that contacts her and those that don't to keep her will updated...  Regardless, CONGRATULATIONS!!! What did you get your degree in?	9
1	The thing with exes is that as soon as we break off with them often times we try and nail them down to one thing. Almost objectify them. Only remember one thing or the last things that happened before we broke up, when the thing that drew them to us is the complexity and how open we could be with them. We saw the humanity in them better than anyone else, and to get reminded of that can be a strange wake up call.  To quote Silent Bob, a little out of context but I think it works just enough to use, "She was a girl, I know that now."	9

A month ago this sort of thing would have sent me home crying (I have trouble separating past traumas from present), but I've been working on my coping skills and I ended up having a really great night and meeting a few nice people. It just sucks that people do that, you know?	9

0	That's cool and all that your parents got a good laugh out of this but as a guy, I would be mortified and feel quite insecure knowing my penis was the subject of an unauthorized someone's laughter no matter how benign it is when they weren't supposed to get the pic. I can't imagine how my parents would react to the reverse situation with a smiley on my GF's boobs or vagina or how she would feel about it.	9
1	So when men lash out at women, we should quietly walk away. Why couldn't this guy do the same thing when she politely declined? Before it got ugly on either side?	9
1	Some people refuse to understand that humans are a part of nature too... There is no "detachment" from nature. We are cut from the same cloth as all other living things and have made our environments suit our needs. Taking human medicine is a natural remedy. Synthetic things are natural. Being a douchebag about people taking NSAIDs is arrogant, smug, and ignorant.	9

0	When wasn't there a choice? Because, I'm pretty sure there wasn't a law that forbade women from keeping their name that had to be overturned, plus there is a long history of women who kept their family name. If feminism = choices, I'd rather choose liberation, thanks.	9
1	I'm not sure of their exact reasons, but it could be to avoid the group of people who inevitably feel the need to say things like, 'awww, you look better WITHOUT all that' or 'What a waste of money!'   &amp;nbsp;  Sometimes it's nice to have a community of just like-minded people =)	9
1	It's not that they're never warranted, it's that the unwarranted ones are excessive.	9
1	Tried, he claimed he did so I was going to follow up on facebook because I can't trust a word he says but by the time I tried they had both blocked me. I could probably find another way if I put a lot of effort into it but I'm just so done with him and anything having to do with him.	9
0	It's not a 100% damsel in the sense of what it used to be, but she still essentially had to wait around for someone to come rescue her. I am NOT denying any of the positives of the character or what came out of the movie, but it troubled me that both female characters had a moment closer to a traditional damsel rescue than other cast members.	9
1	Feels. I'm full of parental issues in general - I still don't know how i feel about my dad dying either. He wasn't the best parent but he did try to be better for my younger brothers, and we weren't in contact when he died for various reasons.	9

1	Well it depends what your aim is or how perceptive people are. If you're going for a natural look with natural colors and shades it can be hard for someone not experienced with make-up to tell weather or not you're wearing it. On the other hand if you're standing there with purple lips and golden eyelids (don't ask me to color coordinate) and someone tells you they can't tell that you're wearing make-up I'd either question your make-up skills or that person's eyes.	9
0	I'm sure its also a hassle for whoever has to clean up the mess. Its not their fault there's no proper way to dispose of sanitary product. I'm sure they don't want to unclog a toilet or be ankle deep in dirty water because its so inconvenient for you to switch hands and wipe. Its not hard. Wrap it up, sit it on the floor/back of toilet wipe and flush. Then carry it to the trashcan and wash your hands. I'm glad I could clear that up for any of you girls struggling.	9
1	Thank you for your comment, it made me laugh which I haven't done at all since shopping. I needed that. :)	9

1	Oh. I was trying to make a joke about the gay remark. He can't be gay cause blue is a boys colour type thing. Bad joke.   I have a 7 yo boy, and I let him do whatever.  Sometimes, he watches Barbie on Netflix. I don't care.	9

0	I get that that happens a lot (from all sexes/genders I might add), *I'm just agianst that it's so assumed that's how it is*. Especially since all we know from that sentence is that the husband doesn't like it, we don't know anything of how often he does it despite not even liking it or if he expects to receive oral himself.	9
0	your eating food, that could be used to feed me so your saying it is ok for me to yell at you to protect my life!	9
0	This guy is totally absolutely in the wrong and it would infuriate me too. But is it really appropriate to come at him for his weight? That just feels like stooping to his level, and kind of a low blow.   Edit: You know, downvote all you want but I can't understand how personal attacks are only condemned when misogynists make them. I'm a female, I'm a feminist. I don't attack another person's appearance. I don't want my appearance attacked, so I don't do it to other people.	9

1	Thanks ladies. Big blanket fort in the living room! I'll bring cookies. ;~;	9
0	Yes, it's the ease and accessibility that's different now. I don't disagree with anything you've said, really. But just because other people double-date doesn't mean it's acceptable to lie (or omit) about sexual activity with others.	9
0	I really don't think putting Nair in someone's shampoo or conditioner is dangerous and illegal. Are you someone who sees the world through an extremely legalistic lens?   Now, if I had advocated that she use violence against him, then yes, I could see where you were coming from. But my original idea was not dangerous in any way. You can't laugh off the bucket.	9

1	My mom was born in the 1950s and I remembered her telling me how much she suffered before the first pain reliever for cramps came out (1970s?).

0	Guy here too; definitely considering buying a ticket and skipping the movie.	9
1	Uh. She let him down very politely, and he responded by being a twat. She took the high road once, but she's not this dude's emotional caretaker and I think it's absurd you would expect her to continue to be polite after this guy has been insulting her, her relationship, and the dude she's dating.	9
1	Showed my husband this, he took it to mean he doesn't get stuff. I guess it's true?	9
1	It seems like she's owning it now that "everyone knows."  We already have a problem with abortion being something to gossip about.  Good on OP for taking back her agency to share this with us.	9
0	Ah ok, yeah, that can just kill libido. I hope you get your roommate/finals/other issues worked out soon so you can have fun! &lt;3	9
1	Alright, here is what you're gonna do.   1. Throw yourself into work. Studying, homework, projects, whatever. Take on extra. You will have NO EXCESS TIME to think about this piece of shit who broke your heart. NOPE.  2. Delete delete delete. Delete him from everything! Facebook? BYE. Twitter? PEACE. Tumblr? SAYONARA. Get a friend to delete his number too.  3. Hot shower + sweatpants + netflix.   But in all seriousness, this super sucks but you will get through it!	9

1	I don't know why you're getting downvoted, people are allowed to be (or not be) attracted to different body shapes.  50 pounds is quite a bit of weight to gain.  A physical attraction can be independent of emotional attachment.	9
1	Not 100% related, but when guys come to me for advice on how to pick up a girl I tell them to complement her hair or clothes. She tried harder on that (usually). Also, it's a lot easier to not answer that I have a SO when someone tells me my hair is awesome.	9
1	I forgot to mention that this friend I asked out is still one of my best friends and in fact I think we're closer than before as I'm not constantly wondering if she's into me anymore!  In hindsight anyway it's kinda clear that we'd not be right for each other, her boyfriend is a much better fit for her. And I've found someone who suits me too!	9

Maybe it's because I'm a man, maybe it's because I'm unlucky, maybe it's because I worked a drive through late nights for years on weekends and got a lot of drunkards, and so maybe I'm missing out on the bond.  Honestly though I can't think of many creatures more annoying than a drunk white girl. So many attempts at free food, loud, naggy, and they invade personal space.	9
0	One time, I made some super duper hotwings, with jalapenos and stuff.  I wiped down the counter and tossed the wet rag into the laundry.  Well come time for sexy times I needed to wipe down a bit.  WHOOPS.  HOLY SHIT...like yeah I feel  you...seriously I remember that burn all too well.  A little capsasin is okay to get the blood flowing but that much..just nope	9

0	No, but I wouldn't take it as a command but rather as a suggestion. Enjoy what you have now because tomorrow the peace could be broken and everything you hold dear could be up in flames. That life's too fleeting to not appreciate every day you have. Don't look at them as just old farts babbling about how good you have it but as survivors of some great trauma who are trying to impart wisdom in perhaps not the most effective way.	9

I've got a stricter curfew than Cinderella.   eta: HOLY SHIT I was making a joke about myself and my long term relationship habits. Sorry that you all seem to think I'm attacking you for some reason.	9

0	Ummm to be fair I would ask the say the same thing as the guy. Not cause your a girl because it is actually Really hard!!! I think Your just looking for sexism where there isn't in this particular case.	9
0	There are of course, high earning artists/designers etc, but for the most part, I would say that the world has a very particular view of artists (think the bohemians in Moulin Rouge). When I left school and went to uni I had no idea what I actually wanted to do, how I would earn my living etc. so I went to uni (in England we were just kind of steered towards it) to do the one thing I love and spend all my free time on.	9
1	My rationale is that my pubes are a part of my genitals, therefore, need to be covered. With that in mind I always pick up bikini designs compatible with them.	9
1	I feel the exact same way! My first love and I broke up about 3 days ago and I feel so great. I'm still sad cause I feel like I'm mourning something that was once great but now I'm just excited to take on the world and not be dragged down a relationship that had obviously run its course. We're gonna be okay :)	9

0	How is it derogatory? Not saying you should do it but derogatory is a bit harsh for such a little thing	9
0	I think we've already reached broad definitions of sexual orientations when shit like pansexuality and sapiosexuality are taken seriously.  Downvote me all you fucking please, I just hope you don't take yourself seriously if you agree that we don't have broad definitions of orientation that pedophilia can fit into, but somehow a bazillion different other orientations do fit into it and aren't worthy of an iota of criticism.	9
1	What I like in this sub is process, more than content.  I kinda wish less of our conversations were about periods for example, but that's likely because at my age they are such old news to me.  What keeps me coming here is the atmosphere of respect and empathy.	9
0	They allow their males to use keyboards?  (joke, my boyfriend is a writer)	9
1	This actually works. Some girl dropped an unused tampon in the middle of the hallway back in high school and the boys all walked single file, pressed into the walls around it. It's like a force field, or something.	9
0	Where did it say *anything* about "professional" in this post? It didn't. It's talking about dress codes being applied to girls and not boys. And yes, it's *exactly* this thing that perpetuates rape culture. Read some.	9

1	Ugh, Evolution doesn't breed anything. And there is a way for boys and girls to compete without ripping each other apart; sports, grades, games, and competitions. And I want to make it clear the distinction between "playing with each other" wrestling (which still shouldn't be encouraged at school) and "beat the crap out of each other wrestling".  I don't get what prison has to do with this but I don't support reduced sentences based on gender (or race).	9
1	Omg. This is so bad and wrong. Did you guys know that the whole stat about marriage becoming less common in America is actually much more complicated than it seems? Marriage rates are actually pretty darn steady among the elite and college educated. They are falling off dramatically for the poor and disadvantaged. So yeah, its less about changing culture and more about the sharp divide between the lower and upper class :/ I can get some citations if anyone's curious, just ask!	9

0	There are ways around pantylines that aren't thongs. Everyone needs multiple types of underwear.   Besides thongs at that age introduce a whole host of things that really shouldn't be introduced. Are the girls going to feel bad about their pubic hair? Shaving down there is complicated--I have keloid scars from ingrown hairs.  Also, other girls having cute undies made me feel bad about my own more basic ones.  To me the worst part is that the mother needed to ask the Aunt to take the daughter shopping. Like, if its just about different undies then take your own daughter shopping.	9

0	Nor am I. I'm a big fan of talking about the issues calmly and honestly. But I'm also a fan of poking fun at people when they deserve it, and that was just the first thing that came to mind.

0	There's not necessarily much ambiguity, but you did have to change the author's word order, which is a corruption of the author's intention.  It might not be huge, but the Oxford comma allows authors to list items in exactly the order they want, leaving their message intact.	9

0	Well, I think saying stuff to strangers and friends differ immensely. I say some pretty horrible shit to my friends because I think it's funny. I don't genuinely really believe that or feel that way, but it's fun to just say things you normally can't in a setting that I know I won't be judged. You don't say the same stuff to a waiter that you would say to your best friend.   You're right. It's still disrespectful, but you keep it inside of a space and you don't let it get out and affect others.	9

Whats the real difference between us and them besides complex speech? All living things are trying to change the world in their favour.

1	The level of nerdiness in this post, man... I need to get on your level.  Good luck figuring it out!	9
1	Even those you can often see through fabric. T-shirt fabric these days is infuriatingly thin, and I nearly always have to wear something else underneath so that I'm not showing off my skin tone coloured bra. I have a dark green tank top that you can actually see a skin-coloured bra through. *Dark green*.	9

1	Oh lord, I was playing Never Have I Ever when drinking with some friends and one of the more squeamish/judgemental people in the group said "Never have I ever done anal", me and two others drank and the looks we got!	9

0	Thanks! To be honest, your post and recent events in my life have kind of inspired me to pursue a degree in the arts. The people I've been hanging out with more recently are a lot more supportive of that. Lots of acting/theater/cinema majors and just more open-minded people :)	9

0	I feel the same way. I get it from everyone. Especially female friends.	9
1	I don't get it either. When I asked a friend of mine out years ago and told her how I felt, I asked if she felt the same way about me. She said no. And that's a perfectly good answer. I don't get why people can't accept that.	9

0	Transgender and transsexual are really the same thing, but from a different angle. My sex is transverse from my gender, and my gender is transverse from my sex. We prefer to use the word transgender because it doesn't have the negative and fetishistic connotations that have been attached to the term transsexual.	9
1	Chub rub is a legit reason to get back in shape.	9
0	The use of the word "worse" implies that it is already bad.    If you are using the right condom for you, they really aren't that bad.  Trojan's Ecstasy is a good one to try.  And they are a hell of a lot better than HIV, HPV, chlamydia, herpes...  Birth control is not the only reason to wear a condom.	9

0	Don't use "I'm sorry you don't feel that way" on me. If guys don't rinse their hair thoroughly in the shower, that's not my fault.  I've never heard of guys using shampoo as face wash. There are face washes for that intended purpose.	9

1	Long as you have his name and/or contact information, it's worthwhile. A report is a report; it doesn't mean much just filed by itself, but it's very useful for getting the cops involved if he bothers you again and allows for you to establish a restraining order against him if he still persists.  But yeah, hopefully that's the last of that shitheel.	9
1	Thanks, I was seriously having an awesome day before the free ice-cream. I almost cried when the little screen popped saying "Congratulations! You have passed your test!" Then me and my mommy got blueberry pancakes at IHOP.	9

0	why not just have him go to the doctors to get a STD panel done if thats your only fear?	9
0	Ah.    So, because math is hard to some, therefore engineering is totes way hard!    -    Essentially, what it comes down to is   *Engineering is difficult - according to engineers.*    Honestly, not that surprising given their mental capacity (limited) and their emotional capacity (barely existent).    Of course, then again, they're the same imbeciles who immediately brand someone who disagrees with them on the Internet as a "troll"    -   TL;DR:  People shouldn't confuse petty arrogance with intelligence.	9

0	Open for everyone *assuming they can physically perform the task*.  E.g. I'm ALL for lady firefighters, but come on, you have to be able to BE a firefighterto be a firefighter.  Calling for gender equality that will result in hurting the people you will serve isn't the way to go.  (I'm referencing lowering standards for testing to be a firefighter, resulting in letting in more women, resulting in fewer firefighters physically able to carry out tasks expected of a firefighter).	9

0	Isn't "men's rights activist" another subcategory of SJW?	9
0	True. My call is that I want my wife to have great sex with me because *I* make her sexually aroused. I get that I'm not the only person a woman will ever find attractive or be aroused by, but when you're having sex with me, I'd prefer it be because you want to have sex with *me*.	9
1	She needed them to actually shovel real coal to get the party boat away from the port police. It's a scene from the pilot of Arrested Development--if you've never watched that show, you *have* to!

0	Welp, nothing to do but burn your username to the ground and start over.  I'm not sure which is worse, the fact that someone can't get support in TrollY for admitting he made a mistake because it involved someone in TrollX, or that people in real life give a shit about what happens on reddit at all.	9

1	Ooh, same story about my aunt, the only one of three sisters who got bad cramps.  She stayed home from school and had this large workbook of different, like, ballet and yoga stretches she had to do that were supposed to help (only a little) with the pain.  EDIT: and then there was my grandmother and great-grandmother.... in those generations, doctors didn't even believe menstrual cramps *existed*!!!!1!!  You know, because (1) how could they? and (2) you know how women like to complain X(	9

1	Oh I saw that thread, the whole thing was fairly messy and terrible. It was about a guy who started paying less attention to a girl and then she asked him out. Loads of guys didn't seem to understand that what happened was probably A. She liked him but was shy and when he backed off she thought she was losing her chance so she went for it, or B. she liked him but found him clingy and then he chilled out and she became interested romantically. I swear these pick up artist types/sociopaths seem to think they're amazing manipulators when they finally develop the very basic social skills that most people develop in their early teens.	9

So lets bash women to bring up the repressed American male. -_-	9
0	The guy whose work I was talking about is just regurgitating the popular Korean game art style from like 10 years ago. All of the rest of my illustrator friends, male and female, are outspoken feminists and they draw realistic looking armor and physiques. Guess which is more in demand. Yeah. My feminist friends! I'm glad to see the industry is changing for the better.	9
0	OP, you left out the ethnicity of the guy.	9
0	&gt;  Unique genomes can also be found in cancerous tumors  It's these kinds of absurdist arguments that hurt the Pro-Choice side.  As far as determining when personhood begins, the legal determination has been about when a baby can (arguably) survive outside the womb.  And why are you even arguing with me? I was giving reasons for why abortion makes sense legally and why the Pro-Life person OP mention was wrong? T.T	9

0	your personal experience in hiring is worth some note, but you're one of many who hire and there *are* many out there who *do not* look at GPAs. everyone is different, no one should assume you'll be hired because of your GPA.	9
1	Yes... this "logic". I ended up blocking my niece on facebook because of this. She was going on about how she looks down on drug dealers and "haha I've only smoked weed, but that's a natural plant not a drug". I just *had* to tell her that it is, indeed, a drug. Even gave her the literal definition, and she pulled that "it's my opinion and I'm not changing my mind". Rage ensued.	9

1	&gt; learn not to take everything so seriously   Sorry, but racist language *is* serious. Don't say it. Find another word to use please, you aren't funny or endearing, you only think you are. I've heard people say *exactly* the same shit about "faggot" and "tranny" too. Those words can fucking HURT. And when you use them, you never know who it is you're hurting. Not everybody is willing to single themselves out for the sake of correcting your offensive language.	9

1	Right? If I'm fighting through a workday with cramps, I just keep telling myself that at least I'm not a pilgrim woman having to churn butter or run a farm or some shit.	9
0	If he's worth keeping, get him to pamper you after your ordeal. Massage and then you give him one. There are ways to be intimate without penetration- this smacks of a selfish desire to just 'stick it in'.	9

1	To be fair, not wanting to date someone because you are not sexually attracted to them is not unfair. You can't just date someone out of pity. However, one shouldn't be mean about it, right? But in this case, the guy is being rude and thinks he has the right to decide for her who she is or isn't going to date. The guy deserved it for undermining her.	9
0	Awww that sucks; is there something else maybe? Like any medication you're taking or are you anxious/depressed/stressed?	9
0	Maybe I don't get the context, and maybe it's because I'm a guy (not a pig, I swear!) but if I am identifying someone I don't know, I would usually use the most obvious feature of the person to describe them. Not in a judgmental way of course, but if a random woman comes to the table for a few seconds and walks away, and she has enormous breasts, I would identify her as "the one with the big boobs"	9

0	Just in the general sense of being downvoted here, it seems that most things get downvoted first, then hopefully the gals will kick in and upvote you back where you belong.

1	And you're badass enough in your skill set that you got TWO degrees! That's crazy awesome	9

0	Denoting it sets us apart from men doing likewise. We shouldn't need to feel empowered to date someone younger by means of a term.   By all means, call yourself anything wanted. And it isn't being downvoted that gets me, it is why I was downvoted: I politely brought up a point. I don't see how that is hostile enough to warrant it.

1	He can't win because it's not a contest. He's done something douchy has hurt your feelings.   When you hide your feelings from other people, mostly you're hiding them from yourself.

1	Preaching to the choir. I'm terrified of babies. Well, terrified of what I might accidentally do to them. I'm SUPER clumsy, and as much as people pish and posh the idea, me dropping a baby is a VERY real possibility. And there's no coming back from that. There's no appropriately-sized muffin basket for breaking a coworker's baby.	9

1	I have started using "I'm not interested, but thank you" and I can't believe how many guys start countering with their positive attributes. "What? I'm a nice guy, I have a good job and a car, I like traveling and cooking, and I would always treat you right," etc, etc. No means no, not "change my mind", dude.	9
0	She got defensive because everyone jumped on her shit and downvoted the hell out of her for something that she felt didnt deserve it.  At this point, fine, I understand. You dont like how she responded. But do you really think the way to get her to see your opinion is to be an ass about it? Maybe her comments were insensitive, but I dont think she meant harm. The reaction to them, however, was far more sarcastic and rude than she ever was. If you want someone to understand how they were being insensitive, the absolute WRONG course of action is to be an asshole to them.	9

1	Both versions are bad (as jokes or otherwise), but they're not equivalent. She's just asking you to consider the social context of each of them. Like it would be different if a vast majority of positions of power in the US and the world were held by women instead of men. In that scenario, a woman saying "men are beneath me" would be worse than a man saying "women are beneath me". Capisce?	9
1	I may have just fallen in love with your husband.	9
1	The person you're responding to never said that rates of rape are increasing. They were just pointing out that the statistics can be misleading and giving reasons why. You also seem to be accusing them of arguing emotionally when they don't seem to be. I'm kind of confused as to why you would think this subreddit is an appropriate venue for this debate, or how you even got here given that you apparently prefer TumblrInAction.	9

1	For future reference just tell them you're not interested in them specifically. Not that you have a bf or you're not looking to date at the moment or whatever, just that you're not interested in them.   If you tell a guy you have a boyfriend then he might think you're interested but the problem is you have a bf at the moment. Same thing with "I'm not looking for a relationship". To some guys that just means "let me find a way to make you interested in a bf".   This way you nip it in the bud right there.	9
1	Oooh that one's pretty!	9
1	Yeah, but she went back a week later and got the cut and color she wanted for free. She didn't say anything at first because of that awkward "well maybe she knows better and this is what looks better for my face" feeling. But then her husband said something along the lines of "good Im glad she listened to me." So my sis said fuck that and got what she wanted anyways. :)	9

1	To be fair though, harassment and domestic violence aimed at men is desperately under reported so he has a point. Men's issues are certainly important too. Plus this guy wasnt even being a jerk about it. If you truly want 'social justice and equality for all' you can't just laugh at someone asking for attention to be paid to real issues.	9

0	Oh sure, but I get it. Their formative years were filled with rocket attacks, rationing, constant death and destruction on a scale the world hasn't seen since. Then after that came reconstruction and the looming threat of nuclear annihilation, then still later Northern Ireland's fight for independence and once again there was fighting right at their doorstep. Most of their life has been filed with a very real sense of looming danger.	9
0	Congrats!!! I just got married in October so if you want any tips tricks or advice for planning feel free to message me!	9
1	Thank you for asking. No pain intended!  No one calls George Clooney a cougar for marrying a woman younger than himself. In fact, there is no term for a man on the prowl, so the term cougar highlights that sexist differentiation: "normal for a man but weird for a woman so let's give it a demeaning title!"   I have not had coffee so if this doesn't make sense lemme know.	9

1	Christ, calm down. No-one is shitting on you. This is literally a new tool for a subset of our community to use. Just because a magazine misused it doesn't mean you're suffering from erasure. Are people calling for Bruce Jenner to be a Mx?	10

1	I read through his Twitter the other day. He claims he did it as a social experiment to see how people would react to something they deem as offensive. It sounds like a poor excuse to save face. The guy screwed his chance at being a game developer for the rest of his potential career. It isn't often that a game is too offensive to be published on Steam.	10
0	There are not many older trans persons in general because of the lack of resources until very very recently, I only have experience with young transpersons, Perhaps I should have left the age variable out or used it for both groups.   I could find citations if you'd like, but you can google "trans person assaulted or trans person killed" as easily as I can. in the majority of cases i've seen, its been by a black male, again i'm happy to google if you're not willing or able.	10
0	I don't feel like the existence of privilege (white, male, or otherwise) is inflammatory. And if it is, it really shouldn't be.   &gt; What I'm seeing here isn't a show of solidarity with fellow transwomen and transmen, it's promoting race-biased ideological infighting.   I agree with you here.	10
0	really tired of seeing white trans folk write about how they could be killed at any minute for being trans when that's not really what the data shows.	10

0	The catholic church (and any others) do not deserve praise just because one person from their order isn't trying to orstracize trans people while still condeming them to hell. A trans person who calls themselves catholic is either masochist or delusional.	10
1	Then you don't believe everyone has a right to necessary health care.	10
0	Yes. As long as we have "gender", we are under an arbitrary, artificial set of restrictions. Some people never run into those restrictions (bars) for a wide number or reasons. That doesn't mean they aren't there, you just don't "see" them.  They are happy living in a small little box, or they willfully ignore that there is a lock on the door and never try to open it, or they beat down one door and never notice the one farther out.	10
1	And which sex wouldn't Santorum wish Jenner to DIVORCE???	10

1	So happy to see her case is finally moving forward. Victoria is a wonderful person and did not deserve this sort of treatment whatsoever.	10
0	That's how I see it too. Passing means trying to appear cis. In that sense, it  is a  sort  of  deception,  but  it is also something many of  us have to do in order to stay alive.	10
1	Jenner didn't really say what pronouns to use. All anyone said about pronouns was that Jenner asked them to use male pronouns during the interview since it would be the last interview done "as a man." So it's a little confusing what pronouns should be used now that the interview is over. Plus a lot of people were commenting or whatever anytime someone said "she" or "they" that it is disrespectful to change pronouns before a person asks.   I really wish Jenner had specified.	10
0	It's really troubling to hear such a big name misuse words like 'bravery' when they really mean 'courage'.  If you're not familiar, I suggest reading [this article](http://www.differencebetween.net/language/difference-between-courage-and-bravery/)	10
1	I love how poverty was just a bullet point and not a focus.   Racial issues are totally what's hot right now.  Non-white, especially black transwomen are very much visible as topics of discussion.  Transwomen and especially transmen who are in poverty are nearly invisible. I find it sad how this article doesnt even mention transmen at all.	10
1	The soles have been saved.	10
1	Pretty sure the santorum definition was [Dan Savage's work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_for_%22santorum%22_neologism).	10
0	Of course it's not how most people view gender. MOST people don't accept transgender either. And it's better described as an Agender experience. Calling me an ideologue though is an ad hominem argument and doesn't invalidate my point. Besides I don't see anything wrong with "zealously advocating an ideology" that I believe in. I'm not a troll, I'm open to changing my mind but just saying "That's not how their gender is to most people" doesn't hold water with me (or probably MOST of the people on this board).	10

0	No, such changes only affect trans people who are LGB.  So, this is not an "LGBT" victory.	10
1	I don't know how I feel about this. On one hand, this is awesome and I love that this is gaining traction.  On the other hand, could our opposition use this as a civil union of sorts and tell us "you have Mx, that should be good enough that I don't have to call you you preferred pronouns"?  Just my thoughts on this.	10
1	And they're still exclusive to females, now it's just all females!	10
1	The last night in my hometown before I left for surgery my friends had a party at their place.  One of the last things I did before going to bed was to walk out in their back yard (no one else was around),  I stood in the middle of the yard and pee'd standing up for the last time.	10

0	rick santorum stance on lgnt - a simple search yields his hatred of the LGBT community	10
0	I stopped watching it about 30 seconds into the video. The reason is that they clearly do not understand the difference between gender and sex. Gender is defined by what's between your ears, whereas, sex is defined by what's between your legs.   They aren't altering their gender, they are altering their looks and in some cases sexual organs to match gender.	10
1	Here's the thing, that's how the public viewed trans women back then. As mentally unstable men. It's just offensive and insulting. The trans phobic part is when everyone found out that she wasn't a Cis Woman. The crying game scene, everyone's reaction to finding out. The sleeping around with everyone. Ya it's transphobic.   addtion, to be fair the movie is old enough to drink. No wonder I didn't come out then.	10
0	You're right about the speedy trial. But the constitution is right, you can't change it, it's what the country was founded upon. You do not have a right to a sex change, it's a service you pay for. I mean I guess it's different if you're in jail (because you can't make money) but outside of jail you must and should pay for it.	10
0	while some people *try* to pass, some people pass without trying.   passing has nothing to do with intent, it's how your expression is read/interpreted by others.	10
0	Oklahoma is typical of GOP-controlled states:   It's heathcare offers NOTHING to the transgender population toward transition -- zero support.  For 10 years it paid for an aggressive campaign to uphold the state's ban on gay marriage.    LGBT employment discrimination is not protected here either.  So tell me why I'd ever vote Republican again?	10

0	Oh yea, that one's pretty fucking basic. I was dating a girl once who was actually super into math and she was  explaining to me that some infinite sets are larger than others. My stance was that they weren't larger, just denser.	12
1	I'm on the West Coast, and they're running TV ads with testimonials like, "They can fill your prescriptions, but they can also recommend natural alternatives." That's what made me realize something was wrong. So I looked them up online and found this video, where they promote homeopathy as an alternative to your doctor's prescriptions.	12

0	I was always bothered with GMO proponents trying to prevent labelling. It's one thing to not support it, but another to fight it. Maybe I'm wrong but it always sounded to me that they think that people are too stupid to handle that information. This is a great step in the opposite direction which actually makes it more clear for people that GMOs are used in so many places.   I would also enjoy if more of the package would be filled with information, instead of fancy logos and big pictures of happy people consuming the product. For example, as some other commenters are suggesting, information about pesticide use or breeding techniques.	12
1	As an aside, I often see exclamations that Monsanto is basically the devil incarnate, yet every discussion I see has the main points shot down, yet numerous people still act like it's evil.  Does anyone have a logical reason to conclude that Monsanto is evil?  The only argument that comes to mind for me is the moral issue of patenting genetics (or the process that the genetic modifications are done, which I believe is what's actually patented), but that's a legislative issue, IMO. Companies are naturally going to use whatever legal means are available to protect their product and sales.	12
0	&gt; Then the point of our conversation is completely lost on you, since you say one thing and believe something else.  OK. How you drew that out of my acknowledgement that I take aspirin is an interesting question, but whatever.	12
1	Like, seriously. Who doesn't wash their beard?   Reminds me of the whole "uncut dicks are so gross because bacteria".	12
0	I don't care what they do or why they do it. The fact of the matter is that farmers have been cultivating crops for tens of thousands of years. Most of the genetic modifications mankind has made would not have happened without farmers using the seed from their best crops for their next planting. Buying seeds from a corporation is an incredibly recent development in agriculture. Even if the best seed comes in an annual shipment with the Monsanto logo on it, Monsanto does not have the right to tell anyone what can and cannot be done with the life that grows from that seed. It violates a fundamental principal without which a free society cannot exist.	12

0	Not a single one of those things has any bearing on thunderfoot's ridiculous attempt at a "takedown" - I read Carrier's blog post and he specifically mentions consent, which is at the heart of the entire rape debate.  tenderfoot really fell on his face on this one, I can't believe anyone takes him seriously anymore.

0	"The Senate rejected the scientific consensus that humans are causing climate change" Finally some sanity almost returns to Washington. We do affect our climate, but very little. Our carbon has actually helped regrow a bit of the rain forest for example. The quote should read "The Senate recognizes that Climate Change has always been a factor, even before humans, it's in the climate's nature to change in cycles that can not be exactly determined."	12

I mean, come on dude. GMOs aren't dangerous, and flour isn't toxic, but processed foods needing to be moderated in one's diet is old, established news.

0	I answered the point, explicitly, you're just digging your denialist heels in and refusing to face that. Have fun with your 'hah we're so smrt' circlejerk against people who actually rely on facts and evidence over 'fun' narratives. Why are you even in a skeptic subreddit?	12
1	The typical bleach you get in stores isn't pure, if that's what you're thinking. [It's often 8.25%](http://cfoc.nrckids.org/Bleach/Bleach.cfm), and that was apparently raised from around 5% a few years back. 28% is quite highly concentrated.  Also, MMC is administered rectally.	12
0	You are right. I have no idea what you've been through. But I'm also not gonna just lock myself in a box and not try things to learn. Thats not what a skeptic is. Or at least not a good skeptic. Try to understand the whole truth. Not just your little box.	12
1	What do you think, OP? You think global warming is causing earthquakes?	12
1	Depending on what time of the year you ask, a majority of the country doesn't believe in global warming. The poll swings ~10-15% depending on if you ask in winter or summer. Apparently "if global warming then why cold?" is an actual question to a lot of Americans.	12

'The UN Climate Panel is purely a political body posing as a scientific institution'"    What's that saying about stones and glass houses?

It's like a textbook demonstration of how to present total nonsense in a way which some people might accept as facts. I'd love to see a rhetorical fallacy breakdown of the transcript (like [this](http://infobeautiful2.s3.amazonaws.com/RhetoricalFallacy_SameSexMarriage.png)).	12

0	It's a well-established medical fact that whole fruits and vegetables are much better for you than refined and processed foods. That starts with refinements as simple as drinking juice instead of eating a whole fruit, for crying out loud, much less eating a Twinkie instead of broccoli.  The original point of this argument isn't that "natural" is better, it's that the closer your food is to nature, the more healthy it is likely to be. We absorb nutrients in food more easily than in synthesized supplements, with only a couple of exceptions. You are obtusely and aggressively misinterpreting the definition of nature.	12

1	Are they *eating* that shit?   That might explain their results...  Edit - Jokes aside: this survey was produced by the Environmental Working Group, a non-profit which I am not too familiar with.  I look at their [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Working_Group) and found a "Cell phone radiation report", so that sets off some alarm bells.  I don't know if they have a particular axe to grind here. But this [older reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/19ya1r/psa_the_environmental_working_group_ewg_is_not_a/) also rings some bells.  I would recommend still using sunscreen as long as it has the right (anti-UV) ingredients in it until some better studies come out.	12
0	I dislike his use of diciton and what he thinks science is...and the idea that religion isn't trying to be science is just wrong.  Also "Dr. Tolin has also made numerous appearances on programs such as The Oprah Winfrey Show[16][17][18] and The Dr. Oz Show.[19][20]"	12
1	The click-baity headline goes a bit too far, IMO.  The issue here is that Vibram's claims went too far. As the article itself says, we need more studies with bigger sample sizes before we can declare barefoot running itself is "bullshit."	12
1	Reminds me of the [Mythbusters episode](http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/surprise-toothbrush-minimyth/) with the toothbrushes and the toilet, finding that even the control toothbrushes in the kitchen had fecal bacteria on them.	12

0	As I recall they genetically engineered people to fulfill certain roles. They had a large labor force of subhumans. That was the basis of their power. The soma and sex were just entertainment to keep the Alphas and Betas happy.  Huxley didn't have the concept of genetic engineering but Gattica was a sort of proto Brave New World. It shouldn't be hard to construct something like it in  the future.	12

1	Unfortunately, no.  Obama signed an *order* granting funds for body cameras, and police can only access the funds if they match it.  Since most police forces seem anti-body-cam, it doesn't seem likely to do much.  There needs to be an actual **law** requiring police body cameras, and it must include *severe* penalties for cameras that are lost, broken, turned off, out of batteries or in any other way disabled, since they always tend to be at just the right times.  The footage should also be streamed to a cloud server outside the police/prosecutors ability to delete the footage.	12

0	IMO companies like Chipotle or even MacDonald's don't have the onus of public health education. On the other hand, they shouldn't be making untrue claims, but like others have said, calling something healthy is vague at best, a misnomer at worst. But if people just take things they see on the shiny picture box at face value, that's their fault.	12

1	They weren't just randomly measuring babies taints (Yep. I just said that...) It's called ano-genital distance and it's used as a general indicator of  masculinization in utero.  Basically, vulvas are lower down on the groin than penises. So the higher the genitalia are, the more masculinized.	12

I like it when things are described as they are, not as we would like them to be or how we feel it would be a good idea to describe them to get a certain effect in the people we describe it to.   So if it is harmless (which it is) it makes sense to me to describe it that way.	12

My intention was to have a discussion about the specifics of this case, and I don't believe I'm posting low quality content (it's not like I think those in the article did the right thing), so I'm pretty sure I'm being downvoted because you disagree. It's disheartening that it seems "Yeah, fuck 'em" is a fine post, but "There's some complexities here..." is not. This is what turns other subreddits into echo-chambers that can't deal with nuance, where the only acceptable response becomes "I agree completely", and that's not healthy.	12

1	I think the scientific skepticism movement has finally (over the last year) turned a corner on the persistent anti-GMO beliefs.  The larger population will get there eventually but we will likely always see some divide with the true believers holding on tightly.  For this reason I treat the anti-GMO people the same way I used to treat religious people; use them as a foil to make arguments to undecideds.	12

How does this reduce the dependence on GMO on Monsanto's part? What percentage of the seed sales are of GMO products and which percentage of the biotechnology support is dependent on GMO infrastructure?      In other words, despite the breakdown you provide, it's still possible that Monsanto is reliant on GMOs to make their revenue versus Whole Foods is dependent on non-GMOs to make their revenue.	12

(granted unnatural pesticides will also be overcome, but they aren't limited to the FDA's 'organic' list) So I started looking, and there was nothing I could find easily.

He could have easily kept it for the creationist museum,  but he called up some paleontologists  instead,  probably knowing that they didn't share his beliefs.

0	&gt; And I just don't get that.  It's because you don't get anywhere in life being an asshole by disrespecting other people. Faith, belief in spite of all evidence to the contrary, is humanity's greatest innovation. Attempts to pathologize religion are doomed to fail. [Robert Sapolsky on Faith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zby67QFbKmU&amp;list=PLD7E21BF91F3F9683&amp;index=39) Belief is adaptive.

My understanding was that they were rejecting it due to very successful propaganda campaigns spread by western anti-GMO organizations, but this is a skeptical subreddit, so show your proof and I'll be happy to give it a fair shake.  The reason US farmers aren't growing it is simple:  vitamin A deficiency isn't an epidemic level problem here, so why should they bother?	12
0	So, you answered your question:  &gt;I would not say that ALL conspiracy theorists have mental disorders.  There you have it, the raison d'etre of your whole thread.

1	Pretty safe to bet that religious beliefs are responsible for the 2 items that scored significantly under 50% (big bang and evolution questions)  Many of the respondents might be educated about the science, but choose not to believe it, because "god". Not really an excuse, but does that make such people "science illiterate"?   I'm not talking about the, "Then why are there still MONKEYS?! GOTCHA!!" type.  Also, would love to see how journalists scored on this.	12
0	What do you with people who are right for the wrong reasons?  I don't think any of us has figured that out, on any side, of any argument.

0	Looks like someone who works for Monsanto wrote this article.  You can always tell the shills.	12
1	The seminar was at a medical center. The center's lawyers are distancing themselves, but the fact is that by renting him the space and letting him call it a "health seminar", they gave this man credence. The parents may have had reasonable expectation that he was a real doctor.  And it's still not clear if the child was still getting insulin or not, and whether the parents were directly advised to stop treating him. I don't actually see official cause of death in any of these articles (it may be too soon).	12
1	It's not necessarily meat heavy. Atkins or keto is more meat than paleo.  Paleo is no wheat (bread, pasta, etc.) no milk products (cheese, yogurt, etc.) no legumes (soy, peanuts, red/black beans). But carbs like sweet potato, salad, green beans, other green veggies, are allowed.  Atkins cuts these out and becomes basically a carnivore diet.  Still, paleo dieters tend to eat a lot of meat.  There's actually a [pegan diet](http://www.eatclean.com/scoops/pegan-diet) that is vegan and paleo combined.	12
1	That's why I think a more helpful argument is not "do you have evidence for the supernatural" because the reflection off a pane of glass counts as evidence to them... instead "Is there a way to distinguish it from a purely natural phenomenon?" is a more helpful stance.  If you argue that the supernatural is *indistinguishable* from not existing you don't run into this problem.  Or if you do, you just keep repeating the question.  Verbatim.	12

1	I mostly agree with his assessment.  I still like Dawkins, though have disagreed with him on occasion-- especially the more vehement opposition to religion as the New Atheist movement developed.  Hitchens was entertaining, but I saw him as someone who flirted more with controversy than intellectualism.   And Harris... ughhhh... He envokes the ticking time bomb scenario as justification for torture, and then attempts to later write a book about morality? That people give him the time of day is shocking.	12

They're not evil, they're capitalists.  They often place profit over the best interests of people like most corporations.  But they deal in food which is an essential ingredient to our lives, so that profit over people motive appears more evil than people making cars or iPads.	12

1	As I understand it (and someone please correct me if I'm wrong) the structure of their constitution is set up so that all power of the government flows from the queen, or king. So without them there would basically be no law and no government. Getting rid of the royal house would create a constitutional vacuum. While this can be overcome by writing a new constitution, the process would be complex and require a lot of political wheeling and dealing.	12
1	That's the problem in it's entirety.  If you convince people that a hulking California style burrito is 'healthy' because "it doesn't have any of those icky GMOs in it" they're actually more likely to be sedentary because they feel they've already made a healthy choice.	12

1	The OSGATA suit was thrown out of court because it was, in the words of the US District Court, "an attempt to create a controversy where none exists".

Many are choosing the second course.  Whether customers are well informed doesn't even matter as much as what the customers currently think. The company's decisions seem to be based on:  * "Will this increase market share?"  * "Will this build more of a healthy halo around our image?"  * "Will some people feel better about eating at Chipotle if we put up this sign?"	12

1	Uh, reverse osmosis membrane desalinators are proven technology. I used to manufacture them. You can actually buy one to put under your sink.  They have simply been too expensive for mass scale use in the US until now, but places where water is even more scarce than California have been using them for years - Saudi Arabia, Israel, Caribbean Islands, etc.  So what are we meant to be skeptical of here?	12
0	50 years ago, nearly all jobs were male dominated. Women overcame exactly the types of things you mention and most jobs shifted to being less male dominated.  Why have only blue collar, dangerous jobs not seen the same transition?	12
1	Specifically people who have the luxury of that fear.  Honestly this would be less of an issue if they had a viable alternative to combat world hunger rather than ignoring the problem in favor of one they made up.	12

0	You can call it spineless, but really, it's a smart move.  Standing up to them gains nothing and risks alienating them.

0	&gt;Of course a less-sophisticated population can be tricked into believing incorrect things, since environmentalists put their efforts into deceiving them.  This pissed me off more than a little.  Just because these farmers are poor, doesn't mean they are stupid.  They love RR corn, so fuck your stupid conspiracy theory.  They don't want to grow yellow rice, which is a cultural thing.  Do you think green cheeseburgers loaded with vitamins would go over well in the states?  You could push them only at inner city mcdonalds.  Hey poor people, they're good for you!	12

1	No.  This is just a laundry list of bullshit claims strung together by scary buzzwords.

0	Are they trying to prove gravity exists and will continue happening? Funny little man can't grasp the meaning of comparisons awww.  Anyways, here's a hint:  The science of Climate Change is in and its settled. Its 100% fact.  So nobody needs to be funding it anymore. Do they want more funding for inventing solutions? Mmm well I don't think they need those because its already too late.	12

1	It's a typical refuge of the crank: science has its gaps in explainability, or there remain unknown elements of processes even if the overall process is fairly well understood. Therefore the thing that **I'm** advocating which is **100%** untestable and relies on predetermined conclusions has some veracity.  It's basically the same argument as "Well, people die after chemo, so doctors know nothing and you should be openminded to this completely falsifiable New Age bullshit."	12

1	One can troubleshoot their diet without an "ancestral dietary lens" that really adds nothing of value.  Healthy eating is based on real science, not vague guesses about what people may have eaten hundreds of thousands of years ago.  Any diets not based on solid science *are* fads, and have no place in human progress until proven otherwise.  There may be some overlap between healthy eating and the paleo diet.  That doesn't make the paleo diet any less silly.  It'd be like taking psychics seriously because they occasionally give good advice.	12

1	The ignorance of this comment is profound.  Take this single line:  &gt;The problem that many don't realize is that GMO's only have ONE strain of corn or soybeans that are forced upon farmers.   There are 100s of lines of GM corn from dozens of companies.    &gt;What happens when this ONE strain of corn or soy beans fail because a bug has survived because of a mutation? You get possible a region wide or world wide failure of the crop.   GM crops are NOT clones, they come from the same hybrid strains as non-GM (including organic).	12
1	Interesting that she states in the Q&amp;A session that the term "GMO" is scientifically meaningless. It makes me recall the public outrage at the concept of "test tube babies", people were up in arms it. When over time the reference to the procedure was then termed "in vitro fertilization", everyone calmed down. It seems simply the term GMO has conjured up a meme in the public consciousness that is at odds with the facts.	12
0	I don't think so. I think it entirely depends on nothing. Either we defend the worst cases or we allow the worst abuses. In democracy we have no choice...	12
1	&gt; Why did Tom Steyer donate 74 million of his Chinese coal profits to Democratic Climate Alarmist politicians? Why did the Democrat politicians accept it?   I think using fossil fuel profits in order to finance the campaign of climate-friendly politicians is a great idea. In fact, that and directly financing renewable projects are probably the best use for oil money.  &gt;Honestly, sometimes I feel like I'm bowling.  To bad you're only throwing gutter balls.	12
0	Perhaps OP wanted to share the skeptical position of Zen Faulkes, who argues that: &gt;*"having so many authors on one study makes “the concept of ‘authorship’ of a scientific paper meaningless.”*  &gt;*“This feels more like a participation award than authorship,” Faulkes writes in his blog. “A possible solution… is that we need to give up ‘authorship’ and focus on ‘credits’ that are clearer descriptions of the contribution individuals make.”"*	12

0	That's a fallacy of false dichotomy.  You can certainly talk about UFOs without discussing aliens.  For example, you could discuss if they are anomalous or not.  If you're concerned with what is behind the anomaly, you could source them to time travelers, inter-dimensional beings, government actions, autonomous drones, collective unconscious.   There's literally a whole host of other, equally implausible or improbable things that could be behind them other than extraterrestrials.	12
0	Excluding deserts (where, incidentally, CO2 is actually at it's most beneficial by reducing water stress), higher temperatures are good for bioproductivity.  e.g. http://jrscience.wcp.miamioh.edu/climate_projects_05/productivity/images/globalNPPmap.gif  I doubt AR4 makes the claim that CO2 is reducing, or is about to reduce bioproductivity.   Why AR4 and not AR5?	12
1	It's a Gawker blog; its connection to reality is tenuous at best.	12
1	Yeah. And let's remember that liking a politician is not just about counting the number of positions you agree with. You need to weigh their votes by how important the issues are and how likely they are to make any change in them. I'm queer but I'd vote for a candidate against same-sex marriage, abortion, etc. if I thought they could fix money in politics, end the drug war, and stop sending so many black people to prison.	12
1	I'm one of those ~~"on the fence"~~ people who doesn't know enough to form a real opinion on climate change yet, aside from accepting the consensus of the majority of environmental scientists as a fallback position until I know more.  In the battlefield of ideas, I'm the kind of person you should be trying to convince with your arguments. I'm ripe fruit for the picking. But posts like what you've made here (and in your posting history) honestly have the opposite effect. If you're debating in order to change minds, either change your tactics or consider taking up literal bowling as a better use of your time.	12

If you are indifferent enough she will know your opinion and not force hers onto you and leave it at that. Not everything need be a battleground.  Not everything that occupies space in your house has to have a job. Otherwise you are going to be very angry at your adult children in future.	12

1	That's because it's not sensationalism. Cruz and the other Republicans in congress are clearly cutting NASA's funding because they are afraid the agency will continue providing inconvenient evidence that man-made global warming is real, and happening.	12
1	artificial selection, genetic engineering, and biotech are all very different from natural selection. We aren't upset with change, we are afraid of consequences for messing with the evolution of OTHER organisms! You should be skeptical when anyone uses the naturalistic fallacy. Just because nature changes genetic code does not mean we are doing the right thing by doing it ourselves. Logically it would be prudent to claim that "genetically modified" is a general statement, but the colloquial meaning of GMO is reserved for artificial changes. If you can't argue past semantics, you are just a dick.	12
0	No. you're arguing against physics. You're arguing that a cld object radiates as energetically as a warm one.

0	Murder is a sin... but using deadly violence to defend oneself, or another, or the faith have never been frowned upon.  Christians have been justifying killing in the name of religion since at least Constantine.   People who murder abortion doctors do so out of religious zeal, no different than the terrorist jihadis.  There is no act so despicable that   it can't be justified by religious faith.	12
0	I evaluate opinions based on the evidence, logic and reason put into that opinion, not based on who's opinion it is, or what their opinions are on other related subjects.  It's certainly harder than dividing people into groups where you'll uncritically accept or dismiss anything they say, but it enables one to develop a more nuanced and intelligent opinion.  But this isn't about me.  Its about a new paper by Lewandowsky.  Do you have anything to say about that?	12

0	&gt; I'm just not sure that's true. There's a reason why academics don't really accept the concept of a "hard/soft science" divide.  A lot of those who are against it are those who fall under the "soft science" umbrella.	12

It is very frustrating when people "debunk" anything without any knowledge of the core philosophies within said community. I'm not here to get in an argument over what is Paleo, but most people that are involved in that type of diet, are way past the "are tomatoes Paleo" argument.	12

Because temporary preparation (ie a few days in advance) underestimating storm severity is a forecasting problem, hence my comment.

The article doesn't deny global warming, but merely asks that we all be skeptical of some of the more outrageous prophecies of the Climate Alarmists.  This is apparently a big ask for some people, but really should be the minimum for any thinking person.	12

0	&gt; I don't know how proving that no water has been contaminated would even work.  Right.

But long-term throwing of tacos into lakes causing health problems can't be ruled out because we haven't particularly studied it.  Sorry, I just hate that argument.

How unrealistic is it to believe that this may allow unwanted fluids to pass through into other, more permeable rock layers?  Also all of the sources you've given are from writers who obviously don't give a shit about the environment if there's money to be made.   It didn't take too much digging to find you make money from oil. You're the problem.	12
1	This is a tough one for skeptics because it is a science issue that seems to have more to do with political allegiance.

0	&gt; Average citizens in the US are subsidizing it exactly the same way - it just doesn't show up in the US energy bill like it does in the German one - it's hidden in general taxes which get sent to coal/gas/oil companies.

0	Because I'm not seeing any science to poke holes in. There have already been numerous studies that conclude that neonicotinoids are solely responsible for the bee decline. The decline is confirmed by my several beekeeper friends. And I have seen numerous studies funded by Monsanto that claim there is no correlation. What more do you need? The creator of Agent Orange and the GMO company banned by Europe will in fact put propaganda to protect their profits.  The alternative is that someone has a monetarily vested interest in taking this giant out and they aren't looking to profit from it. So I guess they are just throwing their money away.	12
0	Probably because they contribute money to dozens if not hundreds of politicians of all political parties, in the countries where they have major operations?

Energy production is just one of those offsets - reduced maintenance costs, longer mean time between full replacement, the benefits of protected utility routing (no more tree-induced power outages!), displacement of other infrastructure like road lighting and signage, reduced deicing costs in winter....these all add up to reduce the per mile per annum costs of the road.	12

I think, it serves the literary purpose of helping the reader identify with the author/narrator. Ignoring that, the major events in the book are known historical events. The coup, environmental destruction, and corporate callousness in the "developing" world described in the book is real. There are enough bones to hang the narrative flesh on, so to speak.	12

They are unfalsifiable, unverifiable, create more questions that they can solve, they grow more and more convoluted as time goes on, any form of criticism is rejected, no opposing evidence is solid enough and no supporting evidence is too crappy.   They are not meant to shed light on a real conspiracy, they are only useful for mental masturbation, to be able to call other people "sheeple", and as a paper-thin excuse to put the blame on people you hated already.	12
1	&gt; He's just talking about man-made climate change theory.  "Global warming is not taking place," then a mention of cold records being, is a clear indication he was saying it isn't warming, not that it's warming but that it's natural.  You got your evidence, feel free to deny it but be aware it will make you look disingenuous.	12

Also farmers can't keep their seed without paying Monsanto again. Basically they're really corrupt, that's not even getting into Agent Orange. At least that is my understanding, somebody correct me if I'm wrong. Based off Food, Inc I think.	12

1	I've been thinking about this for a while now as well.  How does capitalism continue to work when technology is so good that you end up with far more people than things that need doing or are even done well by people?  Even a basic income guarantee, the best idea I've heard to address this problem, seems like a limited solution.	13
1	Maybe capitalism as an economic model dies as something better takes its place. The first step is a post labor scarcity society, which we are approaching, then a post resource scarcity society, then finally a post-currency society.	13

1	I live in St. Louis and we see people like this every year protesting PrideFest. Churches will hand out water bottles to parade participants with notes attached that are like the signs the people in the video are holding. Or they will smile at you and give you a pamphlet filled with hate. Its disconcerting because they seem like nice people but their message is so hateful.	13
1	It implies violent/criminal behavior. For humans, we usually call it a "group."	13
0	&gt; offensive speech must be protected  Here in Australia we have rules against racial vilification in our Racial Discrimination Act. The government made a move to remove this law as increasingly right wing shock-jocks were being called up on it for making sweeping generalisations about people of a particular race.  I stand for freedom of speech, but this is an interesting case where you are effectively slandering a race. If you said something untrue about a person they can take you to court, but if you say it about a race of people, you are effectively protected.  I'm not sure where to draw a line on that one.  http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-04-30/george-brandis-ill-informed-on-right-to-be-bigots/5375302	13

0	It's just nice knowing how the demographics have changed for the better, but  yes, getting challenged on things you believe is a good thing.	14
0	Whatever, semantics. My criticism is not based in freedom of speech.  It still shows you're scared of an open formum either way. Scared your ideas might get scrutinised and not be able stand upto it.	14
0	Not really, voting on the day would be a pain in the arse. I'd only have about an hour and a half in which me and my missus would have to alternate going to the polling station, or get a babysitter.  I'd have a different view of in-person voting if voting was accompanied by mandatory paid time off work to ensure people could get there without penalty.	14

0	By saying we're in control of our own currency you mean that we can print more and take confiscate wealth through inflation? They stopped cuts because they are unpopular, that's the problem with politicians, they can't do what's needed because they have to get reelected.	14
1	Just over £30k and pay ~£100/month (old scheme)  Not complaining at the wage in the slightest, I'm incredibly pleased with it. Just pointing out that paying student loans back does make a difference.  New scheme is effectively a 9pc tax on salaries over £21k. Saying it doesn't make a difference is incorrect.   The debt fear factor does have an effect and to deny/ignore it is causing some potentially brilliant minds not to fulfill their potential which is ridiculous.	14

0	Is it?  I've never experienced it.  I wonder how many Muslims could say they've never experienced Islamophobia, or Jews anti-Semitism?  But crime committed against non-Muslims because they aren't Muslim already constitutes an aggravated offence.  If you think it's sufficiently widespread to warrant being named and recorded separately, write to Miliband and suggest it.  But I shall remain unconvinced until you can produce some statistics suggesting that the number of crimes motivated by 'kuffarphobia' committed by Muslims against non-Muslims is at all comparable to the number motivated by Islamophobia and anti-Semitism committed against Muslims and Jews.	14
1	&gt;looking to get fucked up the arse?  I doubt we'll see a second Tory term.	14

1	Was he that fat that you coulnd't possibly walk around him? Do you feel intimidated when "asian blokes" make eye contact with you?  He's not doing anything wrong. There's a LibDem guy outside my polling station doing exactly the same thing.	14
1	Typical Telegraph inaccurate headline. She isn't saying the only reason she's unpopular is because she's an immigrant, this is the actual quote:  &gt; She said: “I’m standing here today as a migrant, as someone who came to this country and chose to make my life here.  &gt;“And today I’m here to take a stand against those who seek to demonise me and those like me for making that choice.”   She's making a broader point about demonisation of immigrants as a whole and merely pointing out that she speaks as an immigrant herself.	14
1	The crux of the problem to my mind is these groups assume they have total moral superiority; that those nasty Ukip people are all bigots and therefore they can do whatever they like to them.	14
1	Well at least we can all agree Hodges is a complete Prat.	14

0	Hence why you are pressing people in this very thread... It's your typical approach.	14
1	I don't think pure PR could really work unless we had a fully-federalised UK. But if there were something along the lines of Single Transferable Vote, I could see that being a lot more fair.  Still, kudos to them for getting behind electoral reform even though it would halve their numbers.	14
1	It's David Coburn. He's not worth much.	14
0	UKIP in Scotland just need to sit back. Everyone else will just be tearing shreds out of each other in the coming years. Getting in the middle of it won't help. Just sit back and let the voters slowly come to you.	14
0	Because japan is doing so well with its impending economic crisis and demographic issues. Japan is not a model. Australia is experiencing a mining boom and is highly dependent upon trade with China.   A rebuttal would be nice, as opposed to downvotes.	14
0	The concept of human rights is flawed, danger to potential victims should be more important. In practice victims are sacrificed to protect criminals.	14
1	If this poll is accurate it doesn't matter who they voted for, the Tories couldn't have been kept out.	14
0	Yes, but in a situation where the Greens get 21.5% and the Conservatives get just 14.8% I fail to see how the Greens could get so few seats, especially when excluding countries outside England. FPTP tends to exaggerate the larger parties, and in this case the Greens qualify.	14
0	&gt;I don't know why you think it's up to you to not only say people aren't allowed to identify as European  There's no such thing as a European identity. What do Finland and Portugal have in common? Denmark and Malta? Latvia and Ireland? You might as well say that Russia and Burma share an Asian identity. It's complete bollocks.  &gt; but also can't be patriotic unless they support UKIP.  I never said that.	14
0	Haha like Tony Blair? Tony was about as right wing as the Tories, so nothing like Brand. And champaign socialism? what exactly does that insult mean, that he's a rich socialist? So what? Are you calling him a class traitor or something? Get your act together man.	14

1	You're missing the entire point of that debate. I disagree with it, but the argument is --  That the religious text forbids homosexual marriage, or at least there is a large divisive debate about it within the Church, and thus it is not the Government's role to intervene in Church affairs.   Now - what you SHOULD be complaining about is that the state of being married is more privileged than Civil Partnerships, and the fact that straight people can't even get Civil Partnerships.   It's not as if you believe in marriage anyway, but please focus on what the real issue is.	14
1	The Torygraph has gone down the shitter, really down the shitter, in the past years.   I'm not asserting that there is absolutely no corruption in the EU, obviously in a body of its size, with so many organisations there are bound to be some residual levels. But for people (like in this thread) to assert that the corruption is endemic, like that of a post-Soviet state, is absurd.	14

0	Your just reiterating tory spin, Labour didn't build call centers,  Labour didn't kill off our long dead manufacturing industry, and all parties and the majority of the public were actually happy with how the economy was going, if Labour did something to contribute to the recession it was in deregulating banks that allowed the UK financial sector to become vulnerable to the US mortgage bubble.  Also, having a low defecit does not equate to fast recovery from recession, look at Italy, they essentially borrowed and spent thier way out of recession and are now in better shape than before the crash.	14
1	If the polls are true, Miliband is going to feel like a right lemon with that big ass stone tablet	14
1	Staying up for McVey, Farage and Clegg.   If it's confirmed early-ish that Cameron's out, I may crack open a bottle of something and pull a sickie, but I fear that may take a few weeks.	14
1	Imagine espousing the virtues of rEVOLution for years, then endorsing the Labour Party. An an even more timid return to the mean than Owen Jones'.   "DON'T VOTE! SMASH CAPITALISM! So vote in a party who have no intention of doing that at all." I swear, people just make up in their own mind what they think the Labour Party stands for, and then just vote for that rather than what they actually say they'll do.   Also, probably a bit late now for the young disenfranchised who he convinced not to register to vote.	14
1	Peter is horribly wrong about somethings and spot on with other things.	14
0	Sorry love, I've read the UKIP manifesto and I still don't like the party.  Also 'UKIP can't be racist, they have ethnic minority candidates' = 'I'm not racist, I have a black friend!'	14
0	Thank God there's not	14
0	Are honestly trying to argue that Thatcher increased spending on public services?	14
0	Doesn't hugely matter if the referendum mentions it in the question or not, it will be highly implied by the result, if it passes. And there will be plenty of opportunistic people willing to push for this - including the Greens, UKIP and the Lib Dems who will likely benefit most out of a switch to PR.	14
0	I know zero. I've just seen several doctors and nurses say the same thing, I also ask when I'm there. Seems to be a general point of agreement there are too many managers. If it was privatised, how would the private company make money? The NHS should do that.	14
1	Y'know I think the neighbours have a dragon we can borrow. A Fucking Dragon!	14
1	The thing is, if 20% of the country are voted for a party some may consider stupid, racist blah blah blah, who are we to tell them that they have no right to make their voice heard?	14
1	Probably because it's very unpopular in England and he knows it.	14
0	&gt; Political and legal rights are different to economic policy.  You don't think they're linked at all? That what the government chooses to spend money on, has nothing to do with social justice?	14

It wasn't a founding principle of the sub and the sub would not have grown if it was known this would be the case and there were other available options.

1	Thanks for taking the time to post this.  &gt; I don't mean to complain. I get over £800 per month in benefits effectively for free, as well as free healthcare from the NHS which likely costs thousands.  You have every right to complain. As someone who has paid into that tax pot, I *want* you to get those benefits, and the free healthcare, and I don't want you to feel remotely guilty about getting it.  Have as good, productive, successful a life as your able. You deserve it.	14
1	&gt; unsettling when politicians try to have banter with the people?   No. I prefer politicians that act human, instead of PC robots.	14
1	It isn't. In the 40s, 50s and 60s this whole country was socially conservative and economically left wing. You had the death penalty and a nationalised coal industry, prison for homosexuality and milk prices set by the Government. Now we have the opposite.	14
0	Australians have similar contempt for their Labour Party. They won on criticizing the Howard Government's Pacific Solution (where boats of migrants were turned back onto islands to be processed), decrying it as RACIST! But of course when they gave the green light to boat people...more boats came and tons of people drowned. They didn't care though, they just wanted fast breeding voters.	14
1	&gt; You clearly have to assess people who are going to be claiming money from the state for disability, I'm interested as to how you think this could be best achieved? &gt;   Why? Isn't the most qualified and best informed professional to make this decision the claimant's GP?  &gt; Also if you dont mind disclosing, what is your condition? I find it pretty shocking that ATOS would claim you are fit for work if your prognosis is not to live past 35...  Why would you find this shocking? Numerous failed claimants don't live to see the end of their appeals.	14

0	&gt;You could apply that to any politician.  Can you give an example?	14
0	The cultures aren't hugely different, Farage constantly makes the point of these countries being ex-communist. These people just want to get their heads down at work, not try and overthrow the government and oust out all private enterprise haha.	14
1	Their behaviour on this issue over the last Parliament was astonishing. They said they supported it, then criticised Clegg's bill as a mess, said they still supported it but only after a referendum, then indicated they'd vote against it as presented (without referendum), then said the Tories were the obstacle to reform.  FYI, their current plan is to introduce an elected HoL without a referendum.	14
1	Obviously this is utterly unacceptable, self defeating aswell as they have become the fascists themselves. UKIP are no more dangerous than the Greens, I don't know why people get so riled up about them.   It did get me thinking though, what would be acceptable if an *actual* fascist party started to rise up the ranks? Despite the open debate, their vote share started to rise. If the Nazi party were given platforms as any vocal opposition was itself fascist. At what point is it acceptable to start with civil disobedience?   Just a shower thought, I can only assume this is what these people think they are doing.	14
1	The vibrant, peaceful multicultural paradise of cohesion and tolerance strikes again.	14
0	As someone who's grown up through the labour years I have developed a view that labour will do nothing but ruin the steady path to growth that the conservatives have led us on, I don't argue that the recession was there fault but they will do little and may even hurt our recovery.	14
0	Lol -  looks like you're one of those people who shout their opinions very loudly and then start screaming insults the moment their authority is challenged. A bit like Cartman from South Park.  Btw - I was taught about logical fallacies at school, more than 20 years ago.	14
1	It's just a habit I've picked up.	14
0	Are you actually being serious? I mean i'm a Tory, but I recognise the Telegraph has a pro Tory slant, because i'm not an idiot. I don't actually read rags like the DM but I hear that is too. The Sun depends on the election, maybe it's ok with you when Blair hasn't slept with the owners wife and it supports Labour. Are you trying to suggest the Guardian is neutral? I'm genuinely intrigued. This isn't something that is usually debated. It's usually just acknowledged as fact.	14
0	&gt; I believe that people don't need to be told how to behave in this country to make a fair society.  Do you think society was fairer before things like gender and racial equality legislation and the LGBT rights movement?	14
1	There are plenty of politically minded 16 year olds, and I for one believe that if you can be taxed, you should have a vote. The population in general is ill-suited to making informed political decisions, I don't see why the arbitrary age of 16 should mean that you're too stupid and naive to have a say in things. If you can pay tax and raise a family, then that qualifies you to have a voice in my opinion.	14
0	&gt;moderation  Boooooooo, hissssss	14
0	Way to boil down the massive complexities of the Australian election to a ridiculously reductive simplification that's completely inaccurate.  But it's great to know exactly where your xenophobia lies.  EDIT: /r/darkenlightenment poster. Makes sense now.	14
0	Where were you under Blair and later Brown?  Do I really need to explain this or have you been living under a rock?  The labour party are the enemy of freedom judging by their track record.  But who cares, they'll abolish the bedroom tax right?	14
0	Not a lot of condemning going on though. Most over on /r/Scotland think they did absolutely nothing wrong.	14
0	As a way of getting at Islam, which kind of backs my point up! Neither of you are exactly feminists are you?	14
1	I don't get upset by such questions. I'm glad there are people who don't understand what I'm going through, because no-one should go through this shit. I don't berate, I simply answer because that way people's opinions change.  You're right it is indicative of the problem, but I think by explaining why that reasoning is wrong rather than reacting badly to the question, we can change more minds. (Or at least I hope so anyway).	14

0	Honestly, I have no idea why the Conservatives and Labour even bothered trying to keep Scotland in the union, they went from "they are an integral part of this country" to "the Scottish Problem is going to ruin everything for everyone" in a space of a week after the referendum.  What a joke.	14

0	Even the IPCC - the central authority on AGW - acknowledges that global warming has "paused" since 1998. You're just denying the science. [Source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24173504)  That "97% scientists agree" figure has been proved false btw. It was just taken from an online poll. Regardless, consensus in science is not a proof that something is true.	14
1	So that's Indy, FT and Economist coming out in support of Tory-LD coalition.	14

0	I used to think I was sympathetic to proportional representation but then I saw your list of how the parties would fare under the system.  No way do I want an extremist party like UKIP holding the country to ransom with their simplistic claptrap.  I'd rather stick to first past the post.	14
0	Why not both?  It's bullshit in any case.	14
1	As amusing an idea as it is, I think it's about as likely as Katie Hopkins deciding she doesn't want any more big piles of money and leaving the country if Labour win.  Especially considering how much free content a Labour government will give her, she'll be able to write even more spiteful bullshit about everyone for money!	14

0	It's only more expensive if you follow the U.S. process where it takes decades to execute someone, have appeals, get it done in a year.   Barbaric is allowing serial killers to remain alive, even if in prison. It's no more barbaric than where the meat you eat comes from.	14

0	Or maybe our food is insanely expensive because of government meddling and protection of prices.	14
0	Your stance is kind of idiotic. There's considerably more to democracy and democratic legitimacy than just the odd referendum. If the people wanted out of the EU, they should've formed a party that would take them out. And look, they have! And that party is going to get barely any seats!  Case closed.	14

0	Very good point, but my feelings over independence are still likely to prevent me from ever voting for them. Although this campaign is not about independence, and I very much believe that to be true, ultimately it's short-sighted to believe that it's not their main aim in the long run. That's what would stop me from voting for them in most circumstances. But if a push for PR had been one of their headlining policies, it would likely have been enough to win my vote.	14

1	&gt; how much do you think your pain at carrying out tasks is down to simply you're not used to doing them?  this is entirely indicative of the problem of a welfare system that allows people who aren't medically qualified to assume that people with serious conditions are feckless, and make decisions that affect their lives based on those assumptions	14

0	My article is aimed at Labour supporters in Oxford West and Abingdon, a Con / Lib ultra marginal in 2010, who might be persuaded that there is merit in voting Lib Dem, but it is applicable to (among others) Camborne &amp; Redruth, Cheadle, Chippenham, Eastleigh, Harrogate &amp; Knaresborough, Mid Dorset &amp; North Poole, Newton Abbot, North Cornwall, Solihull, Somerton &amp; Frome, St Austell &amp; Newquay, St Ives, Sutton &amp; Cheam, Truro &amp; Falmouth, Watford and Wells!	14
0	Well the alternative to SNP irrelevance is doing a repeat of what they did in 1979. That's the two choices they have. Which one will they pick? Irrelevance or team tory?	14
1	We have a Tory party making gains by scaring English voters with tales of scottish MPs having an influence on the British parliament. I htink independence is the only way this can end.	14
1	The worst thing that could happen in a Coalition of Chaos?  Khorne tries to pass his BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD bill, but a rebellion of Slaanesh backbenchers sink it. Furious, Khorne dissolves parliament and the country descends into turmoil... just as Tzeentch planned.	14
1	Hahah, this made my night.	14
1	I hope they get a few firsts too!	14
0	The Guardian? That lefty rag? You'll need a better source than that.	14
1	Not money. But if I'm wrong I'll change my flair to "I &lt;3 Nigel Farage" for the remainder of the month. If I'm right... you have to do the same with Natalie Bennett. How about that?	14
0	And the world leader in the cause of pollution. It isn't good enough. The world isn't going to go "well, since you're trying, I'll just stop dying". It's either the world polluter or it isn't, that's all that matters.	14
0	Brilliant. This lady should be a UKIP candidate.   More people like this and less people like Roger Helmer and Louise Bours is what UKIP needs.	14
0	Scotland (93% white British) still has plenty of crime....	14
1	Wow well better start drinking our sorrows looks like we have been obliterated.	14
1	Except that reddiquette reserves down-votes for comments that are unproductive or merely insulting. This is one of the cases where a down-vote is completely appropriate as it was little more than 'you are UKIP supporter so you are bad lol'. I'm not a dyed in the wool purple, but every time I see bullshit like this I'm pushed ever closer to voting for them.	14
1	Yeah having a nuclear capable country with a very sophisticated military and the best special forces in the world is a bit of a drag.	14
0	You really haven't been reading the news for the last 15 years have you?  There has been a never ending litany of cases where foreign criminals rights have been placed over the rights of British people.	14
1	Why is it that the host gets away with implying that UKIP must be racist thats why his family were attacked	14
0	Thanks. God knows what Iran have been up to.	14
0	I'm guessing the author probably only decide to write this attack article, because he wanted to demonize her, because she's an immigrant.	14
1	Even council elections? You really are keen :P	14
1	I really wish the Queen would bang their heads together.	14
1	This is just hilarious. The EU has no ambitions for an EU army they said. Now they say that they think it is a rather good idea. The people of UK Politics.	14
0	I'm fairly much in favour of the Lib Dems, but I want to see him hung out to dry for his treacherous hot air, and dirty dealings.  It's a shame that he's fucked up the best chance that the party has had to count in what is clearly looking like a hung Parliament.  He may hang on to his seat - but where's his mandate? More to the point, if he gets lucky, where is his party support. A nasty party suckler is not not what we want.	14
1	It's perfectly possible for immigrants who can't read the English language to be able to speak and understand it. Especially if you come from a country where the alphabet is different.   I can speak a tiny bit of Hindi but have absolutely no idea how to read it.	14
1	UKIP Logic:  If a group of (assumedly) left winger idiots knock over a UKIP stall or harass Nigel Farage:  "Has anyone noticed how the left are the actual violent/fascist ones" "The actions of this small group of people represents everyone who doesn't vote UKIP"  UKIP Candidate threatens to shoot someone dead:  "Just one bad apple" "Not representative" "We got rid of him now so it doesn't count"	14
0	I never understood decriminialisation: it's illegal, but you aren't punished for it. It undermines the respect for law.	14
1	You can't barrage the Farage	14
0	You clearly just called anyone who leans far left on the political spectrum as "intolerant thugs" and portray them as irrational and violent, and for what reason?  Because their are examples of unpleasant incidences which happen on any side of the political spectrum? Because you simply have a different political view to them, so feel the need to demean them with cultist mentality?   I don't understand how anyone could make such ad hominem attacks to an entire political spectrum of people and get so many positive ratings on their comment. Absolutely ludicrous. The same generalisations said about UKIP, and the comment would be negative rated beyond record low temperatures of the Antarctic.	14
1	Excellent! *takes a look*  &gt; Muslims, Muslims, EU, Rotherham, immigration, Muslims and Farage  Nah you're alright.	14
1	For Labour, I've always felt nervous about the more authoritarian "monitor everything", ID cards etc. instinct. It's no worse (indeed, in some respects better) than the Tories' own policies on the same issues, but both parties leave a lot to be desired in that respect.	14
1	[No. I'm not.](http://i.guim.co.uk/static/w-470/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350656296348/UK-budget-deficit-and-par-008.jpg)   As you can see, there is a definite pattern in the data, the only outlier being the financial crisis in 2009 - where most economies in the world were massively affected.  edit: [exemplified more as a %](http://www.debtbombshell.com/images/uk-budget-deficit.png).	14

1	i'm a proper leftie but fuck me was that twat annoying   why is it disgusting that a bloke's worked in porn? bet you if a green candidate had been a pornstar and a UKIP candidate had called them disgusting and immoral he'd be screaming and yelling that they were a prude   for fuck sake	14
0	Loughborough University "Good At Sport, Crap At Everything Else"	14
1	Seems like a perennial problem with QT audiences (plenty of people complain about it with left wing activists doing this- this would just be the other side of that coin).   I don't really like the QT format at the best of times (I don't make a habit of watching the standard episodes), because audience-driven questioning is just too easy to game. I'd much rather a proper debate (where the candidates can cross examine each other) or a standard interview.	14
0	Yeh I'd just get rid. She doesn't have a clue about British values. In a bit love.... do one.	14
1	They were asked by the democratically elected Scottish Parliament to do so. It would have been immoral and anti-democratic to not have a referendum.	14
0	A referendum never settles an argument forever.  The very fact that a referendum has been suggested on an issue shows that there is enough support to make the question worth asking.	14
1	Last time we really helped them bomb shit out of and invade a few countries it didn't really work out too great did it? So perhaps it might not be such a bad thing if we're not the first phone call any more.	14
1	I don't think it's an issue, Cameron's performance was strong and commanding.	14
0	A tiny island the size of France?	14
1	Laugh if it was Danny Alexander	14
1	&gt;Nobody argues that Labour caused the crash  Clearly you missed that bellend in the Question Time audience. Although he may just have been in denial because he works in the financial sector, it's still true that at least one person thinks Labour caused the crash.	14
0	Farage is a member of the East India Club which is men only.  I presume he finds this equally outrageous?	14
1	Gosh, you've just described exactly how it has been for me too. I really wish there were more disabled people telling their stories, sometimes I feel genuinely shocked to hear that I'm not alone in these feelings.	14
1	We can't deport him to a country he doesn't even come from..	14
1	I admit AV has it's flaws, but better some reform than none at all - FPTP is why this election looks to be such a mess.	14
1	It might stifle the Long Term Economic Plan.	14
0	Not a single person in the UK voted for him. Why is he telling us what we can and can't do.	14
0	You picked the show. You are now debunking your own link.  As I said numerous times. I'm not going to watch or listen to a link.	14
0	If you are skeptical, then why not fact check the article and put your doubts to rest?  You speak as if the article is written by a Tory MP, when it is actually written by author and journalist Toby Young.	14
1	You watching an election or looking to get fucked up the arse?	14
0	It's one, small, vote pandery thing which is admittedly shit but won't have any real ramifications, I think it's quite a small thing to completely avoid voting for a party.	14
0	I read the news daily, social media not so much. Mostly just racists bashing Muslims.	14

0	What's the point in trying to be a smart arse? You know exactly what point people are trying to make.   Nobody in the UK ever voted for the EU system the way it is at the moment and nobody in the UK ever voted for these people that dictate what we can and can't do.  Do you support reforming the UK voting system so that you're better represented?	14
1	Oversensitive much? Grow up.	14
0	Don't you dare!	14
1	I dont see how you're saying they dont know how to spend money, they have a budget, they spend it on what they see fit, they are managing to keep within that budget...	14

0	God I hope you're not right =/	14
1	She was never actually 'pregnant'. They were just building the first Terminator to lead to the defence force for George. That's why they weren't worried about a stupid name.	14

0	Lib Dem and Conservative: Twin cheeks of the same arse.	14
1	I personally wouldn't, I think it is wrong. But it is the logical extension of what you originally said.  &gt;I think you should be entitled to legal recognition of any relationship between consenting adults.  How and where do you set the bar? I mean from a legal point of view.	14

1	I have no idea why labour let the lib dems and the tories sell this narrative for so long. Was it just incompetence?	14
1	Piers Morgan left for america as promised after a no vote in the indyref, my advice is don't do it unless they promise not to come back.	14
0	Ex-Communist immigrants with AIDS, who support Labour. Maybe UKIP just hate the colour red.	14
0	So if threads and posts about Israel were getting deleted and one of the mods was an Israeli, you wouldn't think that was noteworthy?	14
1	Think about it like this:  People say "wasted vote in a safe seat" but if they all used their votes it becomes less of a safe seat. People notice.  People say "wasted time spoiling the ballot" but if they all spoiled it then some candidates from major parties are going to get fewer votes than the spoiled ballots. People will notice.	14
1	&gt;mentions her Judaism in any way whatsoever  &gt;\#hitlerwasright  &gt;If you had it your way you’d send the £ to Poland/ Israel.  These are pretty specific ways, if we're being honest.	14
1	I think most of the hatred towards Islam is very much based on sensible arguments but the media spin it towards phobia because it suites their agenda.  This is a religion and a doctrine not a group of people. It should be subject to scrutiny.  Hating Islam for being anti gay and anti womens rights is not a Phobia im afraid.	14
1	There was precisely one non-white person in the UKIP manifesto, and it was an African villager standing next to the UKIP foreign spokesperson (who wants to cut foreign aid).  Edit: downvote me all you want, but you can check the manifesto for yourself, right here: http://www.ukip.org/manifesto2015	14
0	It's irrelevant what I think, but I do know that [the Naval Base Commander thinks he requires an explosives safety policy](http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/lockheed-group-to-manage-uk-nuke-installation/) to govern outsourced and non-government actors interactions with them. I'd like to see Westminster OK that proposal if these nukes were housed underneath parliament.	14
0	Haha, damn it you got me! That was a complete failure though.	14
1	Maybe some people also genuinely want to stay in the EU?	14
0	Sure, but your argument is contradictory.  If debt (not deficit) is to grow at the same rate as GDP then when GDP falls so must the debt, which means during those times there can be no deficit (you need a surplus) since the debt must be paid off.  How does this reconcile with constantly having a deficit of 1-2%?  Maybe I'm missing something in your comment, could you clarify?	14
1	The "rub the right's nose in diversity" quote is often used, but this is just some random isolated quote isn't it? Unless that person let the whole facade of the conspiracy slip for a moment. If it was deliberate, it doesn't seem to have worked.	14
0	You're from ROI. Why does what Scotland want concern you?	14
1	I'm happy to defend my positions and those of UKIP. Which of my views or UKIP policies would you describe as 'delusional idiocy'?	14
0	Now there's a smart cookie.  Why don't we have people like him in parliament, it'd be worth it just to see the outrage on Twitter.	14
1	I do know this place was massively brigaded at one point. Whether that changed the rhetoric I can only assume.   I do know that the left or right bias is up to the users, submitters and commentators here though.   That's not for me to judge.	14
0	Well thats because UKIP is a coherent entity with a singe goal. British Muslims, not so much...	14
0	Just like Cameron you mock and laugh at him. Unwise I think. As much as you don't agree with him, he is very influential with certain people and his changing his tune from not voting at all is a positive move. The more people are encouraged to vote and become involved in the political process, the better.	14
0	Ok, maybe it doesn't so I'll reword what I said to, "Scotland doesn't contribute as much to the Union's coffers, per head, as the other 3 nations"	14
1	We're not talking about public spending.  We're talking about the deficit, which is the difference between tax revenue and public spending.  As I've said, you only need look at the figures.	14
0	&gt; Despite a net-contribution to the economy of immigrants (and the fact that the average immigrant contributes £2,000 more to the welfare system than they take out,  Only if they leave before they get old enough to be a burden on the nhs.

0	Doesn't need any extra detail. It's quite clear and you"re not stupid. Stop playing the dumb devils advocate card.	14
1	That's a very odd comment. I'm not a Liberal voter but I imagine Tony Blair's reaction to such tweets would be to frown, walk into his office, wonder why everyone hates him when he is so nice, and rage about enacting some legislation to stop abusive comments on Twitter. (Which we seem to now have anyway).	14
0	Thank you for your response.	14
0	I'm sure both the Parliament channels regular viewers agree.	14
1	But when Democratic parties such as the Lib Dem's get a chance to at least change it slightly, the whole of the media - both left and right - persuade them it's a bad thing and they listen.	14
1	there are a lot of people who don't have a clue what they're talking about for every age group though.	14
1	Not providing a platform for someone else's speech isn't censorship. They are free to post their own videos and comment sections.	14
1	Yeah their stances on nuclear and stem cell research are more or less my only issues with the greens.	14
1	At this point it is biased toward everyone and a circle jerk for all Parties.	14
0	You reali**z**e that the Suez crisis ended the idea of the United Kingdom being an independent superpower?	14
0	That'll be why stocks of fish like cod have returned to record levels then....	14
0	Not liking Islam: developing a critical analysis and presenting an argument that can be addressed and challenged, is one thing. A phobia is an irrational fear or hatred of a thing, though, so yes that's ignorance based.	14
1	Ugh, fuck Michael Gove	14
1	I really wished Farage had just asked him "Oh so you have never watched pornography?"	14
1	Even signs? I wasn't aware of that, what if you live next door to it and put a sign in your window?	14
1	The Guardian sure has a knack for pushing the buttons of its left-leaning audience with titles like this. Maybe a cartoon of Dave Cameron snapping Tiny Tim's crutches in half would be a nice addition.	14
1	But then things will go to 98p :(	14
1	It blurs the line between newspaper support and actively campaigning (for which political parties need to be accountable to the public for excessive expenditure).   Also the BBC follow the news agenda (they brought over 74'000 copies of the Mail last year, so if you are rich you have more influence over BBC agenda than license fee payers.	14
0	&gt;Eddie Izzard has condemned "aggressive, violent" Scottish Nationalists   This from Izzard, patron of the UAF, whose entire raison d'être is to use violence and intimidation to silence political opponents.  What a fucking scumbag.	14
1	I think "their track record" is the one thing the Tories are actually using as a selling point in this campaign.	14
0	&gt; Would you prefer I just shut up and said everything is rosy?  I'd rather we didn't have every topic devolve into how muslims are terrible people	14

1	Yeah, I distinctly remember a lot of people last summer saying "Excuse me my dear chap, would you awfully mind fucking off?"	14
0	"Shoot" as in heroin?	14
0	Yup, pretty much. All three main parties are polluted by Yewtree. You can find the list of names online if you try hard enough. 10 sitting MPs/Lords from all parties, 40 MPs/Lords total and a number of other high profile civil servants.	14
0	As someone who has witnessed the changes on this sub, do you have any thoughts why it changed from far left to practically far right?	14
1	It's probably more that he knows Greens would be a wasted vote in most constituencies. He says there's stuff he disagrees with Labour on, but we need to get the tories out.	14
1	I would like to pull my trousers down, bend over and show my arse to /r/ukpolitics. Thank you.	14
1	Instructions not clear, postal vote got soggy.	14
1	LOL. I was responding specifically to a bit where you said you had thought she had a posh London accent, did you get that from studying the Green manifesto you pretentious bellend?  &gt;I read a lot.  So you keep saying, and while I'm really impressed, I don't see how it's relevant.	14
1	&gt; The far right or extreme right is a political label used to identify parties and movements based on fascist, racist and/or extremely reactionary ideologies. Officially those on the far right embrace the concept of the "inequality of outcome", meaning that one group is naturally better than another.  So your assumption is that UKIP voters feel superior to immigrants? a very disingenuous assertion.	14
1	Nobody is saying they're a bad thing, jsut that they're symptoms of a bad thing.  Similarly, medical insulin is a good thing. Diabetes however, is not.	14
1	It's not really. I'm as far from a UKIP or Green supporter as it gets, but disenfranchising 20% of the population is simply unfair.	14
1	Though it's worth noting that the Tories were calling for even looser regulations.	14
0	Thanks for reminding us all.	14
1	Dracula has risen from his grave. IDS has been keeping a low profile until now.	14
0	They seem to be getting criticized a lot so not sure where you have this idea.	14
1	Willing to bet on it?	14
1	He is unlikely to be right. Why do politicians make these  rash predictions?   Jim Murphy has previously predicted that Labour will not lose a single seat in Scotland :O and Michael Gove today said that the Tories will win more seats than Labour........in Scotland!  it just makes them look foolish  if they are wrong,  and there must be little benefit in 'talking up' their support. Daft.	14
0	Do you know if theres a legal definition of Islamophobia?  What would you consider Islamophobia? Do you think it would be much different from the legal definition?	14
1	It's not your money you fucking parasite.   I'm wealthy because, besides my own work, I have taken that money indirectly from decades of state investment in the middle class. If I keep more than a small fraction of that, it's theft and oligarchy. Same with anyone rich.  Everyone who can pay tax should pay tax, and the wealthier the more tax. It's the price of civilization.	14

1	A Tory name that decribes what Tories do. Superb.	14
0	Wow, thats some weapons grade hypocrisy right there...	14
0	No facts make you wrong.	14
0	That's what I thought as well. I looked at the picture thinking, "I don't see how the woman is *segregated* from the men."	14
1	The problem is this poll doesn't address how vocal each group is. Ideally it would be number of supporters weighted by number of posts each one makes.  Or alternatively just see how many comments have the words "Muslim rape gangs" in.	14
0	You're worrying sometimes.	14
0	got a link? The EDL are apolitical far as I know other than being concerned with the rise of Muslim extremists in the UK and the whole thing with Muslims pack-raping British children on an industrial scale while it's all brushed under the carpet and the authorities do nothing.	14
0	That last statement is definitely incorrect, you would never find that level of homophobia in lib dems, green or labour.	14
0	If [the majority of] people didnt accept it, they would vote for those who are against mass immigration, the surrender of the sovereignty to the EU and the enforcement of the unreasonable human rights. They dont, therefore they accept the current politics.	14
1	Pricks. That's not a political statement, it's pure vandalism and destruction of property. Criminals.	14
1	&gt; I can't get my head around why he refuses to work with the SNP.  Because its a political trap on both sides of the border. Why would anyone in Scotland ever vote Labour again? Vote SNP get Labour at WM. NS then tries to take credit for the best policies (and would get it in Scotland because of trust) and the SNP aren't daft enough (nor really have the opportunity) to do anything unpopular ala Clegg.  In England, the right wing press will continuously call his government illegitimate.	14
1	No, you see, taking the piss/claiming when you don't need to  **is what benefit fraud IS.**	14
1	You get the impression the "activist" just kind of expected to be able to shout his misinformed rantings at Farage while he and his entourage scurried away as is usually the case with hecklers.  I imagine he hadn't really thought past that point and realised he was way out of his depth the moment Farage stopped to address him.	14
0	If it said only 32% want in, yes. The UK in reality is roughly split. Don't know's aside, In/Out is within 6 points of each other. If people are not deceived the don't knows/undecided along with those swinging from side to side would vote for just trade. So many people have fallen for the line of renegotiation. It means something different to everyone. But mainly and overwhelmingly  comes down to immigration controls and where our laws are written/made.	14
0	So after all that we've got down to calling me racist then?  I answered all your questions in a genuine and honest way, I provided sources and links to where I was getting my information. I asked you to clarify things when I didn't understand what you were asking.   And all you can do is shut down discussion with the same old shit: "well you've got a bee in your bonnet about race" - End of chat.	14
1	That is the point - Islam sees itself as beyond criticism and uses Islamaphobia to silence its critics. I'm sure you already know that of course. Look at Salman Rushdie for how well Islam and its proponents tolerate criticism.	14
1	Have you considered moving to a country where comedians/the public aren't allowed to make jokes about politics?	14
1	Thatcher 1983 increased her majority, but she was facing Michael Foot...	14
1	How long before a Labour cry of Islamophobia and racism?	14
0	But we are not other countries. Our system is rather unique as we only elect about a 3rd of the government. So I think public pressure and tactical voting will end any minority government before it begins.  No elected head of state, lords, privy council these have massive amounts of influence on our lives we have NO control over.	14
0	I'd agree it's depressing. And slightly worrying we might be looking at another bloody labour term.	14
1	not so much the far left as the far stupid	14

0	What I think doesn't matter and will never matter.  In 200 years Britain's population will consist almost entirely of what are now ethnic-minorities and there will be hardly any "Caucasian European" people left.  This will not be the case in Africa or Asia.  In my opinion, that is a shame.	14
1	And there we have it, the other shoe drops. South Yorkshire police have been absolutely abysmal on dealing with CSE, threatened the [central government researcher  in 2002](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/09/researcher-rotherham-abuse-feared-for-life-police-visit), and consistently failed to act when information was passed to them. [Even when Sheffield council begged them to act](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31859931), and gave them funding for the investigation, they managed to do nothing meaningful.  Because they were riddled with abusers themselves.	14
1	The Pirate Party are polling at levels in Iceland that they'd do very well with under FPTP. The only real difference is PR gave them 3 seats that enabled them to show they had a working alternative.  What you're essentially saying is quite scary, that people being able to see more options and choose the one they think is the best is a "whimsical nuthouse".	14
0	I empathise with people who hold this view even if I don't agree with them.	14

0	The iPlayer isn't illegal.  The license covers TV programs being broadcast. I can watch as much catch-up TV as I like - even on a TV - without legally having to pay a single penny.  I do this because their news is not impartial, most of their programs are crap, and it's an unfair monopoly.  Oh, and Jimmy Saville. That really pissed me off.  Edit: Downvotes. Must be some Jimmy Saville fans in here. :)	14

1	I can put that to rest right now; we've been contemplating new mods for a while, since myself and Ivashkin both have our time constraints, and the increase in traffic has made it increasingly necessary.

0	&gt; There was simply no other reason to single out this one religion from a proposal which covers all of them.  The point is, no it does not. Is *only* covers Islam.	14
1	That's naive. Electoral systems aren't just for fuzzy-wuzzy ideas about democracy, they're about building stable Governments and political systems in the societies they serve.  Shrugging your shoulders at the prospect of a Neo-Nazi party entering Government in a society where that is a real possibility is stupid.	14
1	Well, doesn't that make your position the better one? I don't even like UKIP and I'm calling that an utterly stupid comment.	14
0	&gt; Using that information to profile Pakistani throughout the country is racist....  I don't care what you call it. There is a problem of abuse not just of children but also of women in those communities.   I wouldn't just 'profile' them. I'd rip those communities apart. Expose everything that goes on - the abuse, the industrial level benefit fraud, the criminal activity, the attitudes towards women.  Once people see how it really is maybe they will stop worrying about things like 'oh its racist'	14

For example, did you know UKIP only have 1 black face on their election manifesto out of a total of 27 faces? It's absolutely outrageous it is, especially when you account for the black population of this country constituting 4% of the total population, and yet they are only 3.7% of faces on the UKIP manifesto. How do they keep getting away with it?	14

1	&gt; Gone against the democratic will of the public and chose a party with a smaller share of the vote.  This is BS. Nick Clegg represented a share of the democratic will of the public. Gordon Brown represented a share of the democratic will of the public. David Cameron represented a share of the democratic will of the public. All the government needed to do was represent 50%.   If Labour + Lib Dems could have formed a government with a majority, that would be all that is needed to see the democratic will of the public win.	14
1	People are so fickle about union activity.   Most people are pro union activity until it directly affects them. Some car manufacturer in Birmingham fires a hundred employees because they're too expensive, people are up in arms supporting them. Fuck business, power to the people!  Then when the same happens to london transport, it's all, "Fuck the unions! I pay my taxes, I show up for work, I pay my dues, they're holding us all to ransom! They shouldn't be allowed to strike like this, something must be done!"	14
0	Yep. Once people see there not only can not be a renegotiation and are given a choice between, trade, current relationship and further/deeper integration/political union then there is only going to be one outcome. So many people have been fooled into the idea that significant changes can be made.	14

0	Its certainly a controversial area. I don't think Miliband gave enough detail to do anything other than attempt to lure in the Islamic vote.	14
1	Stronger as in their coalition partners would be considerably weaker and have considerably less input as a result. Imagine Theresa May allowed to run wild with her nutter policies of ban everything and everything that the DM crowd wants because there is no viable opposition from within.   LD's have blunted the Conservatives so far, I can't imagine it with a significantly weaker opposing voice.	14

I know people laughed (RB included), but Brand being nominated as the 'best thinker' is not a random outburst of madness... he is engaging youth and those disenfranchised with UK politics and he just endorsed Labour.

It is violent and Mohammed was a paedophile" be classed as Islamophobia? Would a person that says that deserve to be charged with a hate crime?   Edit: Also I don't see why "Islamophobia" needs it's own law. Surely all of this is covered under the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 anyway?   What behaviour do you think it covers?	14

0	&gt;  You can already see that it has been partly responsible for causing hostilities in Ukraine with it's expansion plans.   Every single country in the EU has joined through applying for membership on there own accord. The problems in Ukraine actually caught the EU &amp; US completely of guard. Ukraine tried to play a dangerous neutral game  with the rights of its people between EU and Russia, the people responded by showing they had enough and wanted to move closer to the EU. Russia then invaded.   If the EU is a expansionist then  what do you call Russia?	14

There are day one policies plain as day in the manifesto which will make a huge difference to the country such as top rate tax, bedroom tax, mansion tax, zero-hour contracts etc. etc.   Why do people insist that this is nothing substantial when we are working with a very slight mandate, to get these changes alone is an incredibly important thing and has great benefits	14
1	Because that was a promise he made if the Liberal Democrats won in 2010. They didn't. Not defending him on this, it just infuriates me how people don't understand that because not enough voted for him, he couldn't do everything he wanted. Just like i'm sure Cameron has been denied from doing shittonnes of things too.	14

0	UKIP would be a better comparison and the answer is:    Absolutely never.	14
0	Well I think many would argue that drawing the picture isn't a islamophobic act, but distributing a picture of Mohammed with the intent to cause offence would be.  You're acting as if Labour want to ban pork, or force the wearing of a headscarf.   Its not like the want to ban bacon sandwiches, but they do want to ban acts like tipping a bucket of bacon sandwiches over a devout muslim. An act as delicious as it is islamophobic.	14

1	Labour at 239.   Dear oh dear.	14
1	Precisely, you're arguing that a downside of PR is that views you find distasteful or dangerous will be democratically represented. Forcing national politics into a two-party system when it's not what people want is not an argument for FPTP, and democratically representing the voters *even if you disagree with them* is not an argument against PR. Why shouldn't the Pirate Party or UKIP have seats if people are voting for them?	14

I think those 'I am a Muslim' posts were just jokes.  I think /u/Skuld is responsible for the censorship on /r/unitedkingdom, the other mods are just following orders. I don't think he's a Muslim either, just a bleeding heart lefty.	14

Scotland are able to enjoy the idea of immigration in liberal ivory tower fashion because nobody fucking goes there and the few that do integrate well because if there's not enough of you to form ghettos you kind of have to, so they're not worried about that.

I did see a reddit post about this somewhere) of the population may want voting reform but there are so many options which are flawed and have strengths.  5 years?  Well, if there was a referendum tomorrow about reform/change then maybe, but I doubt it.  If the referendum went though on AV then this would be the last FPTP election. Maybe 10 years.	14
0	I'm laughing at Eurosceptics who think this would be an dead certainty. Regardless of whether you think this is a good or bad thing there's a difference in allowing open borders as part of a free-trade zone and handing over national defence.  Just the idea of Junker asking us to join a EU army and every sceptic is up in arms as if it's inevitable that UK will go plain 'ok'. It's not going to be as easy as that otherwise the EU superstate EUceptics are so afraid of would have happened decades ago.	14
1	Yes, exactly.  Scotland pays into the pot, and then it gets some back. Even though Scotland gets more back per head than England, it *pays more* into the pot than it gets back (and has done for over 30 years). So, Scotland is not subsidised.	14

0	"Leading by example" is useless if developing countries realise we have crippled our economy, *for no practical purpose*. They will do the opposite (as they are doing).  We simply don't produce enough CO2 to make a difference.   Furthermore, the predictive power of the theory of AGW is highly suspect - there has been a 20 year "pause" in temperature rise that none of the models anticipated, and Antarctic sea ice has increased to record levels, when the models predicted it would *disappear* by 2013.   A theory without predictive ability is useless.	14
1	If Cameron has pulled this off, it's one of the greatest political achievements in modern times.  I thought the statistic was that no government every increased its vote in an election, it has always lost seats. He has gained a huge number.  Can't stand him, but it's impressive.	14

1	To be fair, this is a qualitative difference. She's an actual Conservative activist masquerading as an undecided voter sneaking in to ask a question designed to catch Miliband out. Farage was complaining about *the entire audience* and went out of his way to criticise them *during the debate*. As far as I know Miliband hasn't whined to the same extent, he's just taken it in his (graceful, podium skipping) stride.   Anyway, I don't think there was any wrongdoing here by QT. They just got played. But its all part of the game.	14

1	That's a really good point. It annoys me as I feel a Lib-Lab coalition would be a decent result. You're right though, he does seem to be cosying up to Cameron much more, even though his manifesto arguably has more in common with Labour.	14
1	How accurate is the YouGov poll historically vs the BBC exit poll? Seems like a big difference at this point.	14
0	It isn't as valid though. That's what I'm trying to get through to you. Simply holding an opinion doesn't make it as valid as anyone elses.  Person A: Stars are balls of gas burning billions of miles away  Person B: Stars are fireflies that got stuck on a black carpet around the Earth  These opinions are not equally valid. Simply positing two ideas does not make them equal.	14
0	I don't like the Greens feminazi bill they want to push through, some of their stuff is a bit odd (bear in mind I have not read any of the party manifestos) But that may just be tabloid news.

0	Not at all. That's what he thinks. He doesn't think we should be able to leave the EU unless all 4 nations agree to it in separate referendums. 1,210,009 individuals were registered to vote in the 2011 Northern Ireland Assembly election. That means 600,000 people could decide the fate of 65 million. In fact it could be even less than that depending on turn out. Who else but /u/Orcnick	14
1	&gt; we get rid of people like this faster it seems than any other party.  must be all the practise. But seriously, UKIP doesn't always remove them. That guy talking about shooting peasants/generally being racist was defended by UKIP on the BBC till he fell on his sword for example.	14

Others get off on feeling superior for having the Correct Opinions and showing how much more compassionate they are than others, some have a kind of masochist fetish about denigrating themselves. There is also a big link with ironic studenty hipsters who fear ridicule in their insular circle more than anything else and far-left views.	14
1	That's so ridiculous it's not even satire.	14
1	I'm afraid it's difficult to answer the question when every point made in it is wrong.  The governments spending not just as a % of GDP but by real monetary terms has been consistently coming down over the past 5 years. The coalition has not decreased the debt at all, it has halved the deficit as a % of GDP, that being the amount that is piled on the national debt every year because we spend more than we make. Also tax revenues haven't really fallen but they haven't grown that much either, a very slow increase nevertheless over the past 5 years.	14
0	Oh look 10 000 journalists working 24/7 to discredit UKIP found another tosspot to glorify for 48 hours straight.  Won't change a single persons mind	14
1	Maybe. I don't believe those straw polls in the slightest, after seeing evidence of them being brigaded by people outside the sub.	14
1	I'm excited for a hung parliament so I can blame lefties for 5 more years	14
1	&gt;Why should printer workers be forced to print ukip hate messages? Are you against freedom?  No idea what you're referring to?	14
0	Bogstandard response to arguments you can't refute.	14
1	They don't have a lot of readers. I used to buy it regularly but not for a few years as it went massively down hill when it ran out of money.	14
1	UK entertainment in general could survive but i'd say the news  and journalism would be worse without the BBC. Although the BBC may be government biased it seems far less biased than most other news sources.	14
0	Better than hearing ''Scrap I EEEEEEE ON.''	14
1	I'm really looking forward to the Labour/SNP supply and demand government discussing the trinity nuclear program.	14
1	No we aren't.  We aren't responsible for people within our borders without our consent.  We are only responsible for their safe protection until they can be removed.	14
0	Yeh ok. Can't argue with your points about looking after your family.   If your neighbours would be 'got rid of' though under UKIP then that means they're either not legally supposed to be here or not of any benefit whatsoever. So yeh, I wouldn't be too concerned about them.	14
1	But the Conservatives said something very similar...  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3026015/Attacks-Muslims-specific-hate-crime-say-Tories-bid-establish-extent-Islamophobia-Britain.html  &gt;Attacks on Muslims will become specific hate crime, say Tories in bid to establish full extent of Islamophobia in Britain	14
0	&gt; please explain	14
0	Productivity is one form as is an increase in economic activity.  The UK got the increase in activity from adding more people. It wasn't a rise in income for the existing population.  Also that 4 million people need infrastructure, which of course requires spending.	14
0	You are far from alone in disliking Brand.  I find him deluded, dishonest, and misleading - providing uninformed people with simplified and incorrect answers that suit their personal feelings of failure.	14
0	Multiracialism and multiculturalism have a large overlap.	14
0	It wouldn't, it didn't last time or the time before. The Labour doctrine is to throw money at things, there's not enough, so they borrow and when everything goes tits up they blame everyone else.	14
1	You got the 2 and the 1 mixed up there.	14

1	I don't want lower taxes. "Common sense policies" is just a buzz word. Give me an example.	14
0	Answer my questions and I'll tell you.	14
0	&gt; I think it means someone angry reactionary on the right wing of politics rattling on about immigrants and the EU.  You are quite possibly the only person in the entire country who would give this as an answer to the question: "What does nuts mean?"   How do you feel about that?	14
0	Again, childish and ignorant use of '1984'	14
1	I'm not arguing about anything.  I'm telling you, as a matter of fact, that Thatcher consistently ran deficits which were (as a percentage of GDP) higher than New Labour's.  Just look at the figures.	14
1	I'm honestly expecting a second general election.	14
0	But I will, nonetheless, respond (only to thank you for your very mature and well thought out debating point).  You must feel very proud of yourself for having come up with this invincible position ...  Congratulations ... I lose ...	14
0	&gt;The knives have been out for Ukip for the past few weeks. Commentators who have only been to the South Thanet seat I’m fighting once – or in some cases, never – have been trying to put the boot in, and in one case using our national broadcaster, the BBC, to do it.   Farage still can't take a joke.	14
0	&gt; And that would indeed be bad if Scottish independence were a bad thing, which is is not.  Well the majority of people in the UK, including Scotland disagree with you.   &gt;Just like Labour is blamed for the independence of India?  Its meaningless to make such comparisons, when the only similarity is an independence movement. I could point to the creation is Israel just as easily to prove my point.	14
0	&gt; why I’m voting Labour  You write for the Guardian.	14
0	"Sturgen should get a say what happens in the rest of the UK, it's only fair"  Non-Scottish guy has an opinion on Scotland:  "Anyone who's not a full blooded Scot should leave Scotland and is not allowed any say at all. Anyone who is English should be banned from voicing an opinion in Scotland"  Hilarious hypocrisy from the nationalist side, and you still try and push the lie to say you're not motivated by national hatred.	14
1	I love the fact that someone from a country known for stupid politics is mocking the UK's politics	14
1	Sorry to ask such a personal question, but what condition(s) do you have? I couldn't seem to find an answer anywhere in this thread and I was interested to find out.  EDIT:  Cursory search showed a month ago you weighed approx. 150kg at 6'6", considered morbidly obese, and said you worked as a 'forensic biochemist'. Interested to see how you've come along.	14

0	You could withdraw labour by quitting... just saying...	14
0	Ahhh ok, I always considered the Lib Dems as social liberalism in the centre. Never heard of it as radical centre before.	14
1	This ethnic based reasoning never makes sense to me, during the referendum the amount of times people would say "of course Scotland is represented, look who was Scottish!" all I could think was how thoroughly ridiculous the reasoning was.	14
1	&gt; What are they suggesting "England" (by which they mean Westminster) will do when it loses patience?   Kick Scotland out of the union, then invade and conquer it and re-impose the poll tax. Then we'll have the great british union without those annoying Scots expecting votes or influence.	14

1	Nah, a lot of University of Sheffield students are in Clegg's constituency including the first year student villages which are 4000 people as well as other very popular student areas for later year students. Think there is about 10000 students who can vote in hallam out of about 70000	14
1	&gt; With PR they would never ever be in power ...  ... in a majority, true. But looking at the polls, if we had PR, we would likely see a Tory + UKIP majority. Labour + Lib Dem is just breaking 40%, greens AND SNP on top of that *might* break 50%. However, Tory + UKIP could break 50% on its own.	14

1	For God's sake, nobody really sees those from Australia as immigrants, it's just a technicality.	14
0	&gt; Every economist will talk about government spending as a percentage of GDP.   What are you talking about? You claimed that labour didnt actually increase spending because   &gt;You can only really call it a massive increase in spending if government spending increases much faster than GDP growth  When stats show that labour did increase spending. Your reasoning that "it wasnt really increase in spending" is absurd. Labour increased spending constantly every quarter since 1997 until 2008 when the financial crisis caused increases in spending to be dramatically slowed.	14
0	Twat he may be, but he's talking about actually dealing with the causes of immigration rather than just pulling a target out of his arse and painting "paki go home" on the side of vans.	14
1	All i've seen on facebook is a bunch of 17/18 year old liberals going mental over UKIP  It's pretty cringing because none of them actually know the bare minimum of what they're talking about. One kid mistook a certain religion's previous homophobic comments to be comments from UKIP.	14
1	If UKIP can replicate 20% across the country.....	14
1	Wrong answer. You were supposed to respond to his tu quoque argument by pointing to statistics demonstrating higher crime rates among certain demographic groups, thus allowing him to respond with false cause arguments about socioeconomics and institutional racism. Any attempt to rebut these arguments would conclude with him playing his "you're racist" trump card, at which point you lose.  That's how it usually works.	14
0	Are you suggesting ethnic minorities would vote UKIP if only Labour didn't write instructions in Urdu? Or that the Conservatives who have little in the way of policy towards poorer people would suddenly have more poorer people vote for the cuts of their benefits?   Are you seriously suggesting that minorities vote for labour because thy are the only people who thought of using Arabic? You must be daft, Labour get votes for them because they aren't a far right party.	14
0	I can't parse this. Can you please include some commas or something? At the moment, there are too many ways to interpret your sentence for it to be meaningful.   For example, do you think that the Tories are not right-leaning? Or that they are a right-leaning party that does not represent government? What does that even mean?	14
1	Don't see an enormous problem with this - no obligation, bigger house elsewhere, money in your back pocket, deposit covered, removals covered. Some people might be interested, others not.	14
1	I always suspected the police were complicit - in these areas with large Muslim populations, a good proportion of the police are Muslim too.  Hence the complicity.   Muslims are more aligned to each other than to British law.	14
1	Hah, this sounds more like a nickname you got your Oxbridge social club.	14
0	Poly relationships are extremely unstable.  The whole point of marriage was *supposed* to be for two people to commit to each other for the sake of their children - but that idea has been utterly ruined.  Children raised in poly households often end up with quite a head fuck.	14
0	I can't imagine Miliband on stage with all the other world leaders. Cringe.	14
0	Because it is the policy of the EU federalists. It is not the policy of UKIP.	14
0	I didn't, I just pointed out labour are reputed for this kind of thing. Doesn't really matter who's to blame, even if labour, I doubt these cunts truly represent the  party.	14
1	All speculation, but fun and somewhat plausible speculation at that. I think a lot of people underestimate Miliband's ability to break with convention, and the promise for a constitutional convention in the Labour manifesto is an immensely exciting wildcard. It could mean...well...literally anything, at this point.	14
0	Indeed, I am certainly a little more discerning than that, I was posing the question as one of the masses who perhaps have difficulty looking past media portrayal.	14
0	...not when they can just print more, no.  This is why we need a separation of money and state, just like we have a separation of church and state.  Take control of the currency away from the government and banks.	14
1	They are, but he's talking about their popular vote count, which stands at about 16%	14
1	Likely a teller if he asked for your voter number. Not illegal at all.	14
0	I just can't sleep easy knowing that there are people (particularly children and the elderly) denied treatments due to lack of funds while we increase our foreign aid budget.   By all means, donate to charity. I do it myself. However, the current aid situation is both horribly mismanaged and disproportionate to how much we can afford to spend. If it were better managed, half of our current aid budget could help more than double the people it presently does. So whilst it's all well and good to point out what aid *does* accomplish, too little attention is paid to its dismal failures.	14

1	Implying that the longtermeconomicplan of putting our EU membership at risk, gutting money out of the public sector, selling all social housing on the cheap and giving away taxcuts so people can inherit a million pounds and not 650k is what will drive our economy.	14
0	Hah alright pal. I thought I was pretty clear with my post about it being politically difficult for Labour to work with the SNP because it would be toxic to their core support. That's the same reason the SNP are ruling out any deal with the Tories by the way. I didn't think that was a complicated suggestion.  From that point you seem to have decided you'd rather talk about the definition of "pragmatism" and "adding" rather than "saying".  Maybe if you just responded to the original point?	14

0	Actually I agree, moving them out of London and inner cities would save a lot of money, if you're living off the state entirely, the state should be able to relocate you, in this modern age it's not like you're going to suffer any real hardship.  Obviously controls need to be in place so we don't create slums or something.	14
0	When I say orchestrated I don't mean they got people in and told them to rape kids, I just mean they told the police not to arrest them because, let's be honest, Asians overwhelmingly vote labour so they give them a free pass as long as they keep voting labour.	14
1	I suspect a fair proportion of Question Time questions are from party stooges, nevertheless facing hostile questions should be seen as an opportunity to put your case forward.	14

0	Well, it was a good reason, I just got the wrong guy, but yeah, you're right, I should use the mod mail.	14
1	Probably Clegg is out if it ends up at Lib Dems with 10, would whomever replaces him want to be with the Conservatives again? Not sure.	14
1	Huh?   He hasn't voted Labour for 18 years, despite writing for them a fair bit over this time. The Guardian backed the Liberal Democrats at the last election.	14

0	I am saying that the tories, Labour, the Lib dems and the SNP all market themselves to all ages and all demographics one way or another even if they focus more on groups that reliably go and vote.  I can see your point about geography and I do like Prop rep, there are just a few things I prefer about AV. I am saying that UKIP market themselves overwhelmingly to the elderly with policies tailored to their point of view and the greens overwhelmingly to the youth with policies coherent with young people's views.	14
1	Labour's diversity strategy working then...	14
1	It's sometimes an incentive.  In some states in the US, they implemented the death penalty for violent rapes.  This resulted in an uptake of murder in rape cases, as there was no differentiation in punishment between them and *not* killing the victim led to increased risk of being caught.	14
0	&gt;So segregation is fine if it's following our cultural rules but not any others?  Not ones that run counter to our own cultural values.  &gt;That's a strong sweeping accusation bordering on racism.  It's an accurate statement that applies to a lot of Muslims and isn't remotely racist or related to race.  &gt;So are Muslims the only ones who enforce segregation with violence or do Christians and Jews as well?  No and probably. That doesn't make it OK and doesn't invalidate criticism of Islam.	14
0	Ahaha, yes you're perfectly right. Yeh I was thinking of Arthur Scargill. Kinnock was involved in the miners strike too though right? Or am I totally mixed up?	14
0	Why is one segregation not comparable to the other? They're both equally wrong. That's why your point is moot.	14
0	&gt;If you were working class you tended to vote Labour, if you were middle or upper class, you tended to vote Tory.  Oh come off it, the Conservatives only really lost the working class after Thatcher. The working class where far more likely to vote Tory 50 years ago than today. This whole thread reeks of the smug self importance of much of today's youth, where they have to convince themselves they are special and not like previous generations.	14
0	You seem to think Cameron is an evil person who goes to work in the morning and goes "How do I screw the poor".  I do not think that is the case at all.  He has a vision for the country and has a plan for what he thinks is best for the country (with an eye on what he will do after retirement - but then if you believe Ed Milliband does not do that then I have a bridge to sell you).   Just because you disagree does not make him evil or your arguments 'good'.	14
1	Here's to another lousy five years	14
0	But spending is in itself irrelevant - its effect on the national debt level is what's crucial here and debt levels stayed stable prior to the crisis and even [decreased from what they were under the previous government](http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/spending_chart_1996_2007UKp_14c1li111mcn_G0t). Are you arguing that debt levels at just below 40% of GDP are unsustainable?	14
1	Please no.  I don't want 5 more years of cuts.	14
1	&gt;A few years ago she got a young lad arrested, convicted and sentenced  So I understand that she may have got him arrested. But how did she get him convicted or sentenced, surely the justice system did that - and I guess that there is no mention of appeal, that the charges were correct? Am I missing something?	14
0	Seems to split into Labour worried and Conservative voters less worried.	14
1	You may not support them or their ideas, but it is tragic for democracy.	14
0	Labour blame the Tories for all the things they did themselves - and some people believe it.   Zero hours contracts - Labour started them. Privatising the NHS - Labour started it. Tax avoidance - Labour endorsed it. Growing inequalities and less social mobility - started when Labour were in charge.   And now they are out of power they pretend that the Tories did all those things.   This is what is so shameful, and the worst thing is that some of the public are so short sighted they believe it.	14
1	From a right wing perspective, he leads the Conservative party yet does not really come across as all that conservative at all- indeed, you kind of get the feeling that he will say anything or be anything that he thinks will  improve his chance of getting into a position of power.   Hence the modernising nonsense.   What's more, it barely worked for him- here's the man who couldn't beat Gordon Brown in the midst of a recession with which the Labour party was implicated.   Actions speak louder than words- he is pro-EU, cuts defence while ring fencing foreign aid, and the bonfire of the quangos didn't exactly happen.	14
0	Men do it, women at festivals do it. Societal norms are bollocks.	14
0	Except there hasn't been a transfer, and it's unlikely there will be one - considering the Tories are committed to one by 2017, and the LDs have been burnt already, it would make 0 sense for them to prop them up.	14
0	All the parties from Left and Right just seem to be attacking each other with, vote SNP get conservative, vote UKIP get labour vote, green get conservative etc.   There is only one truth..... Vote Lib Dem, Get Lib Dem.	14
0	I am employed, but I don't think it's particularly shocking to suggest that Tories are more likely to work than those dependent on government assistance.	14
1	If they're intimidating (genuinely) report it to the police, it's how the Tower Hamlets mayor was kicked out.	14
0	What a joke this guy is...	14
0	Yes I think I would be too. I've always said I became a responsible adult about the same time I stopped driving like a tit.... that was about age 25! Honestly, it sounds silly but I'm not sure thats far off the mark. ( Incidentally I'd be in favour a raising the driving age too)	14
0	The Lib Dems are open for a coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour. The vote share of Labour, SNP, Green and Plaid combined will be less than a majority. Number of seats will also be too. While some Labour MP's will want nothing to do with the SNP at all.	14
1	Except they're also doing pretty badly in Holyrood under AMS, which is a lot closer to PR.	14
0	Please do not condescend to me!  My opinion is as valid as anybody else's, and is equally worthy of consideration.  As for your immediately labelling me "conspiracy theorist" only, at least in my opinion, indicates your own vacuousness, vapidity, and inability to engage in constructive debate,  Perhaps you are led by what you are told ...  For myself, I tend to listen, discern, and than make my own mind up.  That having been said, you have my best wishes in your carrying on to be led ... (And, even your "please" is obviously without any genuineness or sincerity) ...	14
1	Their levels of borrowing were modest by most comparative measures (including compared to the preceding Tory governments). As I understand it an over-reliance on financial sector, PFI contracts and a failure to regulate it adequately were all bigger factors.	14
1	So an actual progressive candidate who has absorbed british values and wants to campaign for the tories is not British enough? I like some of UKIP's policies but this is just wrong.	14
1	Agreed. Not a measure in sight.	14

1	I don't know the context of this so it's hard to comment.	14
0	So is Christianity to a extent. At least the institutions and the teaching are, yet Tories and UKIP protect them. Are they pro-equality, or pro-Freedom of religion?	14
1	I kinda agree. All that noise about keeping Scotland in the Union, then when Scotland starts finding a voice in UK politics the English start kvetching about it. Very weird situation.	14
0	The people doing these things are bad people. They are in the minority. A tiny minority. 99.9% of people live harmoniously with other cultures. If you honestly believe that Britain would be better off if everyone was white, then there's no hope left for you. You're a racist. You might not like being labelled as one, but it's what you are; and it's disgusting.	14
1	I'm a Dutch citizen, but I don't speak a word of Dutch. Does that mean I am morally bankrupt?	14
1	So you agree that banning Islamaphobia is unwise and that the pledge should not have been made?	14
0	Do you suppose a ban on gender segregation, and if so how this would affect the many many gendered clubs such as golf clubs and private members clubs.	14
0	Pretty sure we gave up our seat for the EU	14
0	Thuggish lefties being all superior with their hateful violence and contempt for our democracy	14
0	No, but the majority of Scotland is voting for the SNP.	14
1	How does history tell a different story? The last Labour government ran surplus for a period. If it wasn't for the global financial crisis then they'd have borrowed less than the Major government. You have to look at the last Labour in government in the context of every government of modern times and the truth is that for around 270 of the 300 years this country has existed the government as ran a deficit. Here's a graph - https://i.imgur.com/4jFeqE3.png  Also here's a database of GDP Revenue and Deficit: http://pastebin.com/nBhu5Sqs   Basically, there as credible as anyone else and they're not setting ridiculous unattainable deadlines, so that's why.	14
1	AV+ is my preferred voting system too, it strikes a good balance between the stability of a Majoritarian system and and the fairness of a proportional system. The only problems are that it's rather complicated and hard to sell to the public as well as being an untried voting system.	14
1	This guy doesn't know his history, and one of the socialist groups want a referendum don't they? I can't remember which one.	14

0	&gt; You mean the Irish that willingly exported their food, despite a famine?  No, that would be the English landowners and the aristocrats.  &gt;  Also, it was a famine mainly due to a disease in the crop, you can hardly lump the load entirely on England.  We can fault them for their hand in creating the problem and for their response to it.	14
1	Nigel Farage (PBUH) needs to find a new egg supplier.	14
1	TIL  Is that why we didn't want them to leave the UK?	14
0	I have never supported the Tories and never will.  Just becaus the Tories are hypocrites, does not mean Labour hypocrisy is acceptable.  Why would you even argue that? You are defending hypocrisy!	14
1	I feel fucking sick.... Not 4 more years.... Please.....	14
0	I personally could not imagine living in a country where your vote meant so very little overall to who governs the Union. Even if every single Scott voted SNP it wouldn't make a lick of difference.	14

1	I was at a debate between Peter Hitchens and someone else a while ago on the death penalty. Hitchens' main argument was that it would reduce the number of murders if potential killers knew they might get the death penalty. There is no statistical evidence for this, and I really can't imagine any murderer deciding that life imprisonment is worth the gamble, but the noose is not.	14

0	That's because almost everyone in that country is Muslim   Anyone got stats of unemployed gingers in Ireland?	14
1	My point is that individual views about things may or may not be stupid but calling someone stupid just for expressing support for a party in an election isn't warranted.	14
0	The Tories are the ones who created a referendum on Scottish independence.	14

1	Uhh, since when have they not done this?	14
1	Christ, I'm far from a UKIP voter, but receiving twice the vote share that the SNP received whilst only getting 2 MPs is crazy.	14
0	Ah - in that case, is it true?	14
0	You can call me Mystic Meg.	14
0	Do you know how many solar panels are required to power the whole world? Less than you think. Please read up on the matter.  The green position on nuclear is entirely consistent.	14
1	Labour would call your bluff.  SNP voting down a Social Democratic agenda? What would you try to demand from Labour? What could the SNP possibly get that's not already in the Labour Manifesto? Would the SNP really attempt such brinkmanship, the chance of a Tory majority in the inevitable election (remember Labour's war chest is empty now) with the Scottish Parliament elections next year?	14
1	Remember it could all be so different. You'll have to wait till the small hours.	14

1	The Tories concentrated their election campaign too much on the character and capabilities of Miliband. A year ago it was going swimmingly, Ed did not seem like someone who could lead the country. Suddenly, Miliband is a decent bloke who may just be leadership material, and the Tories have been caught with their pants down.	14
0	That's pretty much what I said. Opposition to fracking is about sticking it to big business.	14
0	You can have her if you want. She can go and declare independence for Northern England or something and we can be left in peace up here.	14
0	I don't understand why this sub has such a hard-on for PR. It removes the tie between MPs and their constituency, reducing local representation in parliament.   It also makes it extremely difficult to vote out a dodgy politician, since his/her only concern is pleasing the party leadership to secure a seat from the proportion of votes the party won. Many countries with PR are terribly flawed democracies with nearly zero accountability.  I understand the flaws in FPTP, I just wonder if people see the flaws in PR.	14
0	But I will, nonetheless, respond (only to thank you for your very mature and well thought out debating point).  You must feel very proud of yourself for having come up with this invincible position ...  Congratulations ... I lose ...	14
0	Thats because its a local issue.	14

1	Haha. Very possibly just doing his usual bumbling fool act. Have you read his books? They're good. It becomes very obvious very quickly that he's no fool.	14
0	Force refers to physical viloence and where as civil law has to be tried in court where it can be defeated and/or compremises can be made for future progress.  The law has gotten women in to the corperate board room 3% to  42%  women. At the moment they are waiting to see if they stay non excuitives (the reason the pay gap hasent been closed in that sector)  or now that they have the experience will they get naturaly promoted.	14
1	Haha, the guy who said "Blaming immigration for the problems of the NHS is a smokescreen", and then without a hint of irony in his voice: "It's a problem of too much demand".  Seriously? Nobody would be that air-headed on TV, would they?	14
0	Actually I do.  Originally common law was solely the customary law of the English people whose evolution was solely in the hands of judges under Case Law.  However parliament came to have an increasing role in the development of Common law via Statute law which was created by Acts of Parliament.  Hence the slave trade and  the British Empire was ended by Acts of Parliament or Statute law which became part of the corpus of Common law.  I'm afraid its you who does not know what he is talking about.	14
1	This is why I hate Labour more than any other party	14
1	He can't hear you. He's shoved a champagne cork in each ear.	14
1	I don't believe I contradicted that. They did indeed raise their flag on a flagpole immediately after a Rotherham type story emerged.  Apparently it wasn't worth putting it off this year.	14
0	We were talking about Somalia, how about you stay on topic and maybe we won't all have to be mind readers, it's bad enough trying to make sense of what you're saying when I've already shot your point down.	14
1	It's easy to sneer, but I think it's good he's trying to speak to people who don't give a shit about politics (which lets face it, is a significant number of people). This Youtube channel gets a lots of viewers, and the presenter seems bright and engaging.   It was quite funny though when he realised the vid wasn't going out until after the voter registration deadline though.	14
1	Except that was not in Election Wipe. That was said in an interview where he has no obligation to be impartial. Not to mention that it's not all he said... He later goes on to individually mock the others.  Also if you watched the episode, you would have seen that it was impartial. All the parties got their fair share.	14
0	&gt; ould be almost exactly the same, what would be the point of leaving....right?  I want to leave the EU. I'm not saying that its likely that we can't get a trade deal, I would agree with you that it is almost a certainty, but we cannot necessarily guarantee that it will happen. A 99% chance is not the same as a 100% chance so it shouldn't be on the ballot.	14
0	That was quick - dont know why he even made the 'no deals' claim...its simply not workable, they have to at least have an agreement that the SNP wont vote down his Queen's Speech. The Queen doesn't gamble - she ain't turning up unless she knows the speech will fly.	14
0	One more time. If people can be honest about what In actually means then I am fine with In/Out. If they can not, then the document itself should be. If current relationship won, then that is very clear. Any further integration would warrant another referendum.   If we vote to leave that will be that. But if we vote to stay it will only be a few years before another referendum will take place. Between a rock and a hard place really. Be honest or risk a second referendum within a few years.	14
1	If the Mili-man delivered all this he'd go down as one of the great PMs. Would just prove that economics shouldn't be the be all and end all of politics.	14
0	Only racists *and backwards immigrants* vote UKIP..?	14
0	Please just go away, you are pretty boring now. It is abundantly clear that this discussion has nothing to do with EU elections.	14
0	&gt; The British government is responsible for the welfare of the British people and no-one else.    So you need to fix this or you might come across as saying something you don't mean.	14

1	This is how it should work, parties compete, the more competition the better the results	14
1	It's just another gimmick.   I still have lying around my flat a labour pledge card I promise to do this and that. Anything they say or promise expect them to do the opposite.	14
0	Because in case it hasn't slipped yours or Russells attention that's what democracy has pretty much always been about in this country. South park did an episode on it,  where the boys have to choose between a douche and a turd. I can't believe someone who is apparently supposed to be a respected political commentator has only just figured this out. That's the game here. Pretty much all Labour has had or needed in most of the country for years is saying ' we aren't the Tories' and now the snp can say ' we arent Labour!' Not many people love the party they vote for.	14
1	Pretty sure that, like Saville, the rapists themselves were responsible.  That particular council (regardless of the affiliation of EVERY member of the council) undertook a disgusting cover-up.  The fact they were run by Labour cllrs. at the time doesn't mean that Labour were to blame.  They were cllrs. of other parties involved as well.	14
1	So, Farage is ok with [an event that barred women altogether](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-attends-hustings-in-south-thanet--boycotted-by-greens-and-labour-for-menonly-audience-10000659.html), but an event with men and women sitting in separate aisles is wholly unacceptable?  Plus I wonder if there would still be the same reaction if it were [a room full of orthodox Jews](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2014/12/28/once-again-ultra-orthodox-jews-delay-a-flight-because-they-refuse-to-sit-next-to-women/) rather than a room full of Muslims...	14

0	Making sure soldiers are treated respectfully and fairly when they come home from duty  Not having money go overseas to corrupt politicians.  Theres a couple.	14
1	That is really quite funny. It never occurred to me that No 10 is listed so this sort of thing would usually be chucked out of any normal planning application anyway. Imagine the headlines when planning is refused but he gets the secretary to overturn it.	14

1	For all its faults the BBC is still a great institution that provides an alternative to the largely bland free-to-view content we get from the commercial channels.  The BBC is a trusted brand around the world and a great advertisement for Britain.  My biggest fear at this election is that the extremists get in and try to dismantle the BBC. That would be the most insane act of vandalism against something that has become part of British culture.	14

0	That is not Ukip policy.	14
1	Horribly plausible - though Jones does seem to miss the fact that convention IS that the incumbent gets first go at forming a government. If the Tories have most seats, they'd have to be defeated in a vote of no confidence before Labour got a go. That's not a coup, that's just how it works.	14
0	Then you're a quarter Danish. There is nothing you can do about that. It's a fact. I'm Cornish, English, and British. There's nothing I can do about that either. Identity is not tailor made. For better or worse we are what we are.  "Never forget what you are, for the rest of the world will not. Wear it like armour and it can never be used to hurt you."	14
1	I think what little IRA support there was (and it was overstated; some British people honestly thought McDonalds were a sponsor) dried up pretty much on 9/11	14
1	He's incredibly steadfast in his predictions. To this day he is *still* saying they won't get &gt;6%.	14
0	No. It can be improved, but anyone suggesting that voting doesn't matter is literally retarded.	14

0	Mr Fletcher is putting the case that the BBC can't move to a subscription model because it has an important job to do. I'm asking him how exactly that job is manifested in most of the shit they put out - shit which could easily be produced by a commercial broadcaster like ITV.	14
0	Thank you for injecting some much needed sense and rationality.	14
1	Multiculturalism has been an unmitigated failure. The idea that radically different cultures and value systems could live side by side without integration has been disastrous.	14
1	So you're saying Third World people have grander aspirations than native Brits?	14
1	This kind of "activism" is something Farage actually needs. He's well prepared to deal with this kind of stunt, and he thrives in that environment like a Gurkha in Burma. He's a real professional and he understands that this amateurish heckling only makes him stronger because it allows him to advance his strategy as presenting himself as the underdog standing up for the common man against loony left bearded hipsters.	14
0	More Muslim bashing from the idiots. Must be hard being such a cunt all the time.	14
1	Honestly, less than 5 and I will be disappointed. We will probably get more than the "poll of polls" 14% because of shy voters. I guess only time will tell!      Edit: I am dissapoint	14

0	Farage's line of playing the victim in the past few weeks is backfiring.	14
0	Wow, that was needlessly nasty. Surely it would be better to share some actual information on what you think is "detached from reality" in the Green manifesto, rather than just empty sneering?	14
0	So your example is a regulation that has been replaced with a more suitable one?	14

1	He's counting on the fact that the SNP are so anti-Conservative that they'll back him on the important stuff anyway just to keep the Tories out, without any need for a formal deal.	14
0	Populist, centrist politics is the only reason for this, it's fucking depressing. Two popular parties, nothing between them.  I think we should always have parties that represent both the left and right, both leanings should always be trying to bite chunks out of each other, that natural to-and-fro brings balance to the force. And I say this even in the knowledge that it can occasionally be absolutely brutal for one side.  The only ideology left in voting seems to be a toss-up between what you hate more, cuts or borrowing.	14

1	I voted 'Yes', but I didn't really support AV. It's not much of a difference to FPTP and it would legitimise the system putting us further away from proportional representation. What we should have had a referendum on was 'Single Transferable Vote', not 'Alternative Vote'. Just like how Universal Healthcare advocates in USA should oppose "Obamacare" as it's a poor attempt to placate people.	14
1	The fact that someone who LITERALLY said, *and I quote*:   &gt;“The economy is just a metaphorical device. It's not real, that's why it's got the word 'con' in it.”   Is taken seriously by any even remotely educated homo sapien is deeply disturbing.	14

1	I'm really hoping that there are a lot of UKIP shy voters ... to reduce the conservative vote	14
0	No, they represent those people's interests in parliament, sure. But they should not in any world be allowed to lead the country.  You know, I'd care less if I could vote for the same party in England, but I don't even have that opportunity, so it's ridiculous.   Another major point to consider is why should a party that want's to break up the country, be allowed to lead the country?	14
1	You think millions of people earning a pittance is good news? I suppose its good news for businesses who can now exploit young people. Its not good news for the economy because you are lowering peoples spending power.	14
1	Germany has a mixed system, not PR.  Germany's political system is a more interesting and relevant example generally for possible constitutional reform than the free-for-all PR radicals want.

1	Plus death penalty is just absurd.	14
0	There's plenty of reasons for an EU army but Eurosceptics seem up in arms about something that's not even fleshed out, there's nothing to suggest UK involvement would be an inevitability.	14

1	Probably didn't advocate voting for the Tories.  He's been incredibly outspoken about this government for the past 5 years.  It was likely a scathing attack on Cameron and co. and advocated a UKIP vote.	14
0	Yes, so is it the case that Clegg knew and deliberately misled us or was he completely naïve and didn't see it coming? Either way it's worrying.	14
0	Not as much shite that gets posted in /r/scotland.  http://en.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/34uarq/how_reporting_works_in_glasgow/cqy624w  &gt;the unionist reaction to a narrow win was to riot like animals, burning and snarling pretty much indiscriminately  If such shite was written about Yes voters all you lot would be wandering around Reddit brigading and down voting it to nothingness like you always do with any criticism of SNP or nationalists.  In /r/scotland Hate on people who wan't to stay in the Union or English people? A-OK, yer a grand lad! Say you want to stay in the Union? Prepare to be downvoted to oblivion, hated on, called names and told you aren't a true Scot.	14
1	&gt; If ukip get only 10% of the vote why one earth should they have a single MP in Parliament?

Therefor they should make up 10% of our elected representatives.	14

0	Also in India. But since when are Indian citizens allowed to vote in the British Elections? One remembers that Indians NOT being able to vote is pretty much the reason India and Bangladesh and Pakistan are independent. No, what you mean is "these languages are spoken among people ethnically from the region". Not that these people are Commonwealth citizens since they are clearly citizens of the UK.   Also? You need to demonstrate work for 5 years in the UK and most employers need people to speak English.	14

0	Under Tony Blair the UK halved it's EU rebate on the proviso that France would halve it's CAP and give the money to some more deserving countries in Eastern Europe. The UK then halved it's rebate however France renegaded on the deal and decided not to halve it's CAP.	14
1	&gt; Downvotes for how I voted? We're better than that aren't we?  Well, you are literally asking for it, Mr RightWing4Downvotes.	14
1	The only source in the article is an unnamed "senior Labour official", and he seems to be largely speculating rather than having any actual evidence. This sounds like part of Labour's faulty campaign to try and convince people that [only the biggest party gets to form the government](https://iainmacwhirter.wordpress.com/2015/03/21/labour-still-dont-get-it-the-biggest-party-does-not-get-to-be-the-government/), and that we have to vote Labour to a majority in order to stop the Conservatives.	14
1	Twitter fell to the red army back in 2010.  Everyone on the centre right jumped ship over the last few years leaving a leftie echo chamber for everyone to gather together, appreciate each other and all get universally outraged by the same things.	14
0	I'm sure "some" people do. But I'd like to know how many people want to stay in EU = EVER CLOSER UNION (you can check the Treaties).	14
0	Seems like it would appease both the left and right, lefty here says he's suffering already, well it would end his "suffering". Righty wants him punished in accordance with the law. It just seems win-win.	14
1	Good article, comments would make a statue weep.	14
1	&gt; there's exactly zero evidence that the SNP will use their position to further imbalance the setup of the UK.  Apart from their campaign to get rid of a chunk of it.	14

0	No. She's an annoying little munchkin woman who seems to want to ruin everything we used to call Great Britain.   I'd have the silly bitch deported tomorrow and all her delusional minions can go with her.	14
0	Thank you. And I think you'll find that many people who, e.g., work in immigration would certainly dispute your claim that immigration is "uncontrolled".   But that's not the point. I'm not interested in debating facts. That's for another occasion. I'm interested in what, specifically, convinced you.	14
0	The problem he has is they can say they freely chose to segregate themselves, and how can you prove they didn't? Do we start telling people their "free" choices are unacceptable?	14
0	&gt;Well, for one, we're all European. There is a lot of shared history.  Not really. No more than Asia. They don't share an Asian identity though and only an idiot would say otherwise. Turkey doesn't have anything to do with Japan. What shared history do Iceland and Cyprus have?  &gt;Can someone say they have an African identity, if they are from Africa?  Not really unless they're ignorant of the hundreds of cultures within Africa. Lesotho and Algeria have precisely fuck all to do with each other.	14

1	What Scotland chooses to subsidise with its block grant is up to Scotland. It's not "unfair" or "undeserved", it's what the Scottish Government have been elected to implement.  At the end of the day, Scotland pays more into the pot than it gets back in its block grant (and has done for over 30 years). So, even if the exact amount is based off of English spending, Scotland is still paying its way and should be allowed to spend their budget as they wish. If England and the rUK want similar subsidies, they should elect politicians that wish to implement them.	14

0	The SNP does not fundamentally oppose cuts. They just believe in cutting over a longer period.	14
1	STV is more proportional but still keeps the MP-Constituency link. If anything, it's better, as you're more likely to actually have at least one MP that represents you in terms of political views.	14

Ukip linked to assault on man for merely displaying election sign	14

1	Have you ever actually read the Guardian?	14
1	I think you have actually answered it yourself.   As a western rich society, we are vaguely proud of our social safety net, you don't need charity, you don't need to beg. And anyway we are a rich Western society, top ten or even top five economy. Powerhouse.   Yet the growth of food banks suggests that we are much poorer than we think, and more unequal, and some of our citizens and their children are hungry.   It's a judgement on our so called success.   Hence the uncomfortable feelings that you are reflecting.	14
0	It didn't actually. And Holyrood doesn't use PR. It's AMS, which is half PR, half FPTP. It works okay, but I have concerns that a reasonable number of voters don't understand how their vote works.  PR alone is wickedly unstable. I wouldn't want the UK to have its very own third republic.	14
1	yeah, I don't trust people who use big words. They're up to no good.	14
0	Do you think there is something wrong with the poster or something?	14
1	"The left and the Labour movement will have to mobilise in great numbers."  Well there's a storm in a British tea cup if I ever saw one.	14
0	Funny how Labour's failures are never "suitable material for a political football".  Overspending (which they deny), starting illegal wars, opening the borders to the EU resulting in massive overcrowding, and allowing the gang rape of thousands of working class white girls.   Somehow Labour don't think any of these things should be talked about - I wonder why?	14

1	The Standard is good for a free newspaper and at least occasionally tries to present a range of political voices. But the dominant message it represents is that of only one London, the wealthier part, the bit that no doubt goes to the same dinner parties as Sarah Sands, where they all discuss the obvious truth of trickle down economics and the tyranny of inheritance and property taxes. This declaration is just more confirmation of that.	14
1	True. I see it more as a fudged way of vaguely saying they will clamp down on hate speech rather than anything particularly concerning though.	14

1	The SNP can never get a UK majority, so it is probably in their interest to make sure nobody else can either.	14
1	It's a bit clumsy, but certainly not a bad idea.  Cameron's hasn't been held accountable for all the promises he failed to keep.  If Miliband is *literally* making them a millstone around his neck, then that can only be an encouraging sign.  The real test will be how they react in five years' time if they fail to keep them for reasons out of their control.	14
1	But that is literally what they said? The stone thing is a bit daft, but it seems the six pledges are simply headings for a more detailed plan that they have equal intention of delivering. You'd struggle to fit all that writing on there, hence a more "snappy" summary.	14
1	&gt; it's pretty much the worst thing ever.  It really isn't.  &gt;I'm probably going to go back later and hope for a less zealous officer  It won't help, he's only doing his job, he cannot let you vote without your name being down.  Seriously, just get on the sodding bus.	14
0	You are forgetting Gordon Brown raiding private pensions in the 00's.  That sparked the fear that led to people investing in property for retirement instead.	14
1	There's no need for all the "I don't bother myself with such feeble matters, I focus all my attention far too deeply on more important things such as their manifesto policies and I am..."   People are simply responding to this  &gt; I just thought she had a weird posh London accent.  And saying that it should be clear right away that she sounds Aussie or perhaps Kiwi.	14
1	Growth which led to an increase in the tax base. Look at the figure, debt as a % of gdp was fairly stagnant until 2008.	14

I think we must disagree with what marriage is about, because I don't see how people engaging in a marriage that is slightly different from your own in any way weakens yours.  If you're proposing an "own thing" instead of marriage, would you agree it should have the same benefits as marriage with regards to law?	14

0	The problem is that the majority don't care enough to vote, which implies that they don't care enough to strike. If the government has to prepare for a general strike every time 10% of a union's membership get annoyed enough to vote for a strike, it give disproportionate power to those people.   Personally, I'd deregulate the unions and give businesses the power to sack strikers (provided that all strikers were treated equally)	14
1	This is what happens when you have a politician who goes and talks to the electorate and tries to persuade them of your points, rather than just mocking them. What on earth is Russell Brand meant to do when one of the two major parties comes out and calls him a joke - and through extension calls the millions or viewers and followers stupid. Such shot in the foot for Cameron.	14

0	&gt;The overriding priority on 7 May is therefore, first, to stop the Conservatives from returning to government and, second, to put a viable alternative in their place.  Getting the Conservatives out of office is more important than having a viable alternative? So a worse performing government, as long as its not the Conservatives?  Wouldn't expect anything less from the Guardian.	14
0	The state shouldn't always be utilitarian just because it runs something.	14
0	The rate at which it is rising is not statistically significant - so can not be counted against other factors: in other words, it's at odds with the theory.  The lack of rise is at odds with the fact CO2 levels have increased.  None of the models predicted this rise.  When a theory lack predictive power, it ceases to be useful.	14
1	&gt; rest of the world was already in recession  The USA had a shorter recession than us I believe, and also entered it at about the same time?  I can't really comment on Labour's spending plans in the 1990s, I was too young, and it's a lot more difficult to get concrete information on something so subjective.  &gt; with even the lowest borrowing figure being greater than the highest Thatcher figure  Not as a percentage of GDP, using that metric the deficits of the two governments are very similar.	14
1	And if it does, it appears they could take it to court and presumably they could scrap the result and hold a fresh election. Even if it is within a few hundred it could be argued it is worth it, with the publicity around it.	14
0	Anyone considered that he means they will not win any more seats than the 2 they currently hold?	14
0	PR would just mean you could only pick an MP for national issues. You want a local MP to help you on local issues, for that PR doesn't work.  Edit: it appears I was thinking one type of PR was called PR and the others systems were called other things. Either way, you still lose local representation in more sparsely populated areas.	14
1	I'm getting very bored of comedians thinking that just because they've spent a few years making jokes about politics they actually know anything about it. It seems to be a problem unique to British comedians and it's frankly embarrassing how seriously some take themselves.	14
1	It's like the tory party only without having to listen to the crazy backbenchers :)	14
0	What is brilliant is that despite the tories having however many more thousands of likes on facebook, interviews such as these are immeasurably more influential. It actually reaches people who may not be as of yet convinced of his message instead of creating a 500,000 person large circle jerk of people who all agree with each other.	14
0	Oh ok, so if Scotland gets invaded we should use the Barnett formula to decide how many troops to send to defend you, the reason people pay more tax than they get back, is to fund all the other stuff in the nation as well. It should be balanced.	14
0	Up until the European election they did, but the vast majority of it was negative though. I think they intended the coverage to harm them, but after winning the European elections have changed tactic and started giving them as little coverage as they can get away with.	14
0	I just took the radio transmitter out of my TV, so no tax, use it to play games but everything else I do on the computer now anyway, I might just chuck it out all together and watch Civilization back when the BBC made good documentaries.	14
0	Yes it is. How the hell did you honestly expect the Lib Dems to implement their whole manifesto when they were a JUNIOR partner in a coalition.	14
1	I imagine a lot of Lib Dem voters will be very angry about that notice.	14
0	It started off being done to Griffin. Then it happened to Farage. The left found both instances hilarious.  But hey, as soon as it happens to Labour, then it becomes an issue.	14
1	Presumably the intolerance for UKIP has awakened some more aggressive activists (there's been alot of reports about people destroying UKIP signage and going as far as assaulting someone who defended it), and in certain areas this has probably spilled over into intolerance for right-wing parties general.	14
0	I stand by it. If you don't like unpleasant truths stick your head back in the sand.	14
1	It's slanted away from the two big parties and towards more minor parties, I'd say. Strawpolls of this sub consistently show disproportionately high support for UKIP, Greens and SNP. I think it's just a consequence of supporters of minor parties being more politically engaged and therefore more likely to browse this sub.	14
1	I think that you've gone full conspiratard. Never go full conspiratard.	14
0	It's not a level playing field. It's a referendum. We don't have to report two inequal positions as equal.	14
1	Likewise the Tories still don't accept that the first two years of austerity pushed back our recovery. Before they ~~switched to plan B~~ stayed the course and reduced the amount of cuts. Its irritating that they won't admit that they changed the plan to adapt to the circumstances, and its irritating that they won't admit that they almost caused a double dip recession as a result of excess cuts.  In conclusion neither party will admit that they're both shit at managing the economy.	14
1	&gt;They had their 5 years, they thought they could convince everyone that being in government was worth the costs.  Or maybe they felt obliged to try to enact as much of their manifesto as possible, given the public elected their MPs to do it even if it did cost them popularity.	14
1	Hence the blockbot. One of the left's favourite pastimes is policing what opinions people can have.	14
0	" silly bitch deported" Seems like your demonizing her because she's an immigrant?	14
1	I'd like it not to be referred to as a 'tax' all the time. It's a charge or a reduction on entitlements, not on money earned afaik.	14
1	I'm pretty convinced I'm the only Tory here.  It becomes most obvious when you look at the posts that reach the front page, and perhaps to an even greater extent, the top comments against them.  Labour supporters aren't necessarily the most likely to post or comment but they certainly do like to down/upvote.	14

0	NI then, I only saw their activities in ROI. Question still open.	14
1	This pretty much confirms what I thought. The subreddit is pretty balanced, with a major skew toward the non-major parties. The reason people think it's a "circlejerk" is because people downvote way too readily, and with disproportionate numbers of supporters for UKIP that means large numbers of downvotes for those who disagree with UKIP (and Greens of course, but we have more UKIP supporters).	14
1	Not a great start with your moderation...	14

0	Oh, I'm glad we have someone here who's possibly voting Lib Dems... In two minds myself, over Lib Dems and Greens, as a first time voter. Anyone wishing to point out any hindsights I may have by thinking like this? Or, in other words, anyone wish to show me the flaws of the Greens or the Lib Dems?	14

0	If this law makes the statement "Islam is homophobic and sexist in the extreme" illegal, then I'm against it.	14
0	It's becoming quite plain that Farage is a bully when it comes to these things. The BBC policy, the SNP policy, this is stuff that he comes out with for no other reason than to punish people he doesn't feel tow the party line, and what's worse is that he's leveraging power that's completely misplaced in him. How many people are voting for him based on his EU position? Now he takes that power and abuses it to attack completely unrelated groups that he doesn't like.	14

0	I think you mean the people you're hanging around with. It's the same with the varied political sphere I'm apart of, we could all debate each other for hours, but BTEC Barry and Hairdresser Helena from the local college still only believe what the face book propaganda tells them, or they don't care.	14

1	Their books have been signed off every year. Here is the European Court of Auditors, the body responsible for auditing the EU budget.  http://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/ecadefault.aspx  And said elsewhere the funds are handed to member states, and then spent. So any misappropriation is due to misspending by members, not the EU central body itself.	14
0	No, I'm saying that we shouldn't have the person proposing the referendum creating new rules about the referendum. The two sides aren't equal, they don't have equal support, they don't have equal facts, and to try and force them into some weird artificial 'equality' is just meddling by the man who knows he would lose.	14
1	I don't know. But I'd hate to see any general negative talk/criticism of Islam being labelled as Islamophobia and people getting in trouble for it.	14
0	Suppose he is rich enough not to have to care about the effect unlimited and unrestricted immigration has had on working class people and areas. Labour is the party of economic illiterates, immigrants and naive "right-on" Guardian-reading idealogues who are quick to label people racists and pat each-other on the back. The smart working class people are choosing UKIP.	14
1	If they didn't believe this could influence The Sun readers, they wouldn't have used it. I certainly think it can influence people who are on the fence, maybe even subconsciously ("He doesn't look prime ministerial"). Personally I wouldn't underestimate the stupidity of some people (certainly not The Sun readers).  But even if it doesn't have any impact, it's still sad that it exists... Is this seriously the front page of the most read newspaper in the UK?	14
1	Nobody is saying that, he'd obviously be punished severely through the justice system.	14

0	&gt; Not all Muslims have abhorrent views of women, apostates, and homosexuals but some (most) do.  How do you tell them apart from the UKIPers?	14
1	You know the Green party isn't just one person? There is a multitude of views under a Green umbrella. Just like the Conservative party have Eurosceptics and Europhiles, and Labour contains socialists and redistributive capitalists. Green party official policy may be anti-nuclear now, but it might not be in future. And the great thing is all you have to do is become a member and you get a vote on whether or not that changes. Not something you can say of any of the other parties.	14

0	yes it-is. Been discussed loads of times here and loads of UKIP supporters agreed, they started using this sub more after being banned on r/uk.	14
1	Yes it was, and the reason it was deleted was given to me as:    &gt;It was removed because it was horseshit. Further comments to that effect will also be removed.  I am open to having my opinions questioned but this type of authoritarian censorship and disregard of people who criticise Islam reminds me of the Labour party. Very disappointing.	14
0	No but it demonstrates that Scots have had a say in the running of the whole country, from the very top. Scottishness, Englishness etc shouldn't really have an effect on the job the PM does as he acts in the collective British interest.	14
1	Here's a toy example.   Chemistry - we have invented a miracle fertiliser that will reduce food prices!   Economists - what will happen to the market with plummeting food prices?   Sociologists - how does society change without food scarcity? Do we need to build more gyms because people get fatter? What are the health implications of a society with no malnutrition?   You could pick almost any example. Everything you do has an impact on society.	14
0	Its to protect EU business. It makes economical sense for the EU to not let cheep produce come in to compete against EU products and produce.   South Africa makes amazing cheese and wine, but because of the EU its restricted to protect the french market. Only EU countries can compete with france fairly for its cheese and wine market.   There are rules and regulations put in by the EU for imports that most African companies can't meet. Work safety for the African fishing industry as an example.	14
1	This isn't how it will work at all.  Why do you think there has to be a formal deal with the SNP for the SNP to vote for a Labour Queen's speech? They're obviously going to want a Labour government over a Tory one whether there's a deal or not.  This whole idea that Labour has no option but to formally work with the SNP if it wants to get into power is one that's been cooked up by the SNP themselves and by the Tories. I can't believe how many people are going along with it.	14
1	Are you serious, Bulldog?  A guy: 1) known to both Mods and regulars of this sub for being banned for having so many duplicate accounts and manipulating up/downvotes that the site admins sat up and took notice;  2) who persistently posts links to Strawpoll polls that somehow always seem to get brigaded by the likes of 8chan (or otherwise simply derided on not counting votes only once)  ...and you posted this suggestion with a straight face?	14
1	&gt; But an immigration court has allowed him to stay in Britain indefinitely because he could face torture or inhuman and degrading treatment if deported, possibly by the Islamist group al-Shabaab, in breach of Labour’s Human Rights Act.  Does anyone really think it's acceptable to send someone to a place where they are likely to face torture or inhuman and degrading treatment?   Nobody deserves that, not even rapists. I'm glad we have the Human Rights Act.	14
0	&gt; You can do the numbers, but a deficit of 1-2% of GDP is perfectly sustainable  As long as the economy is growing by that amount or more year, and that when we hit a bust we keep the deficit at 1-2% of GDP (which would have required MASSIVE MASSIVE cuts, waaaay more than we got).  But that's not what happened, the deficit for 2009/10 was 11%, and the economy shrank by 6%.  When you're playing the Keynesian game then play by the rules, if you cherry pick to suit yourself then you're going to have a bad time.	14

1	"SNP are secret Tories" is honestly just Labour propaganda. The SNP has been economically left wing for at least 25 years and were never really that rightist even before that.   I mean, Salmond was once expelled for the SNP for being too left wing. Maybe that is because he actually is left wing and has taken the party in that direction?   Or maybe that was just step 1 in his carefully thought out 34 year long plan to deceive Scottish voters. hmm.  Though I accept that there is a strain of capital N nationalists within the SNP that are not exactly progressive. Roseanna Cunningham comes to mind.	14

1	Compassion. Voting because you agree with what I'm saying, whether it effects you or not. For example, I'm not in education and I have no kids; but I support the policy that tuition fees should be abolished because I consider them unfair and from a financial point they don't even work as a form of tax revenue as so many students fail to meet the threshold of pay required to repay student loans.  I would hope you would vote based on both your own situation, and on a moral stance. If however you're not moved by the moral argument or compassion to reconsider how you vote, well I can't change your view.	14
0	&gt;They've caused more damage in he past five years than the previous fifty.  How do you quantify that?  I agree though that this is exactly what the writer was trying to get across.

1	Last few times I posted to /r/skeptic one of the regulars came out of  the woodwork accusing me of being a racist or a nazi or something (apparently I'm on one of those "lists").

The mods aren't the only cancer there -- the whole place is a cesspool.	17
1	&gt;But the ridiculous fever-pitch of it all is wearing thin: “I think a lot of kids also will kind of wake up at some point and say, ‘This feels a little suffocating, some of these ideas feel like it’s really being jammed down my throat,’ which is a good reason to kind of question it, right? Like, why is every week, you know, global-warming week?”	17

I linked to the NASA site which says this:  &gt;"Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities, and most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position."  And then here is the link showing the major science organizations that believe climate change is (1) happening and (2) manmade.  http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/	17

0	I don't know, how many grants? You don't know either. My only point is that the article makes unsupported claims and isn't going to help either of us become more knowledgeable on this topic. Do you normally 'hear' of who gets awarded huge climate related research grants? I'd bet you don't have a clue. FYI AGW deniers do get research grants (eg Willie Soon, Richard Lindzen ect). I agree probably not as much from the public agencies you mentioned for a variety of reasons, some valid and some probably not. I don't know. Again, the OP's article isn't going to help us here.	17

At one time, people ascribed them to divine retribution for man's wicked behavior.  Alarmists still maintain this simple anthropocentric view of the world. That is, they attribute natural disasters as mother nature's punishment against man for befouling the environment with his evil C02.	17

0	&gt; Would you believe it was eight years ago today that the United Nations predicted we only had “as little as eight years left to avoid a dangerous global average rise of 2C or more.” This failed prediction, however...  How is this a failed prediction? It's looking likely that the temperature anomaly will reach +2°C this century, and this is largely due to the lack of serious carbon emission curtailment over the last 8 years.  The article reads as though it was predicted that there would be 2°C of warming by 2015, which would be a ridiculous mischaracterisation.	17

In most cases, the authors say that their work doesn't support the anthropomorphic global warming theory that 90% to 100% of climate change is caused by humans.  But some of these authors have either support the argument that humans have contributed to climate change.  So yes, this is a partial dispute of that article.  This "dispute" does not mean that the basic conclusions of the article are wrong.	17
0	So because its difficult to get good results in such an uncontrollable environment, we should just stop trying so hard?	17
1	I often wonder, does it even make sense to compare any kind of local observations to the long term average? I think Willie Soon said it best: **the average American has one boob and one testicle**.	17

0	That human-released green house gases cause a rise in global temperature. Of course models aren't 100% right, that's impossible. Why have many different models? Because there are many different approaches to modeling the Earth's climate, and taking the approximation of many is a way of triangulating to increase accuracy.   Where is the denier's model? Where are their papers? I read the literature- why aren't they participating in the scientific dialogue? I don't mean blogs, I mean peer-reviewed publications.	17
1	Ugh, Connor's emails are so annoying and frustrating to read. All he does is Appeal to Authority and Pascal's Wager. I found Dyson's last email very satisfying. And it's literally like an atheist/agnostic arguing with a religious fanatic.	17
1	Minorities and women hardest hit	17
1	&gt;The three main political parties have barely uttered a word about the environment and even the Green party seems to be prioritising an anti-austerity message  The Guardian, in the midsts of its massive climate campaign, must be utterly crushed to discover that they can't even get GREEN candidates to talk about climate change much.	17
1	The sounds of a thousand journalist keyboards can be heard, writing updates to their series of posts about the plucky young teens, who'd forced the government to act on climate change.  *Just kidding, they'll completely ignore this inglorious defeat and the precedent it sets*	17

1	Appeal to authority is the safe harbor of the ignorant warmist.  They say, "Yeah, so you're smarter than ALL those scientists?," and shut off reasoning of their own.    Also prevalent is the non-sequitur argument that Arctic glaciers are melting, therefore uncontrovertible evidence the planet is doomed.  It impossible for them to imagine glaciers melting harmlessly after a Little Ice Age.	17
0	But this is the problem: you do need to do a lot more than just read some simple numbers of raw data stream.   Again, I understand that you think that this is sufficient to understand the data.  But I guarantee you that even a climate scientist who questions the data would tell you that you can't understand the data.  Anyway, I'm not sure why you say that the CO2 levels on earth or the earth's temperatures would support your arguments anyway.  The warmest years in recorded history are all from the last 20 years.  CO2 levels are higher than they've been in recorded history.  Which numbers are you looking at?	17
1	I thought patriotism was bad this year -- that's what all the cultural Marxists tell me.	17
1	It is only a matter of time before the FCC gets involved in Website content.	17
1	Up until that point, all criticism was silenced. ClimateGate opened the door to dissent. Besides, the fraud goes way deeper then that but zealots have eyes and can't see. They have ears but can't hear.	17
0	So these scientists from 40 years ago and current climatologists are the same people..?	17
1	I missed the "in the US" portion. Honest mistake.	17
1	Wow ... how harsh and ridged the orthodoxy is protected. You have an eminent scientist with phenomenal, world-renowned credentials. He voices an agnostic view ("We simply don't know for certain") and he's excoriated as if he just argued the world is flat because the flying spaghetti monster told him so in a dream.  I'm sure it won't be long before the most extreme and fervent begin to eat their own for not being "pure" enough.	17

0	Yeah, thats of the *utmost* importance.	17

0	Technically Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen only make up 92ish% of the human body. Also the forms that Carbon, and Oxygen are not primarily in the form of CO2 I the body. Now the body is 57% water but that does not really contribute to the addition of hydrogen or oxygen to the body, as the body doesn't usually break apart the water molecules.	17
1	Science is all about adjusting the data to fit the theory.	17
1	&gt;Wait you actually read the National Geographic article?   Unlikely. There has been an upsurge of the kind of soft focus comments above, where the poster affects an authoritative position, throws about a few keywords, and says basically nothing.	17
1	Even people who write for HuffPo are trying to distance themselves from Klein's particular brand of crazy:  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/till-bruckner/naomi-klein-climate-chang_b_7148090.html  I've tried to engage with the anti-capitalists a few times to try to understand what they are thinking.  I have yet to get a clear picture of the alternative they think will replace capitalism.	17
1	Censorship is a warning sign, but I wouldn't call it "proof" of anything.  For example, a lot of schizophrenics believe there are people with full-time positions (paid for by the government) to send messages into their brains via satellite.  This is of course a taboo belief that will get you labeled as a crazy, but that doesn't mean I think they are correct!  Even if there is some sort of satellite-based technolo0gy being used to drive people crazy, there's no way they can know what you are thinking and have full-time operatives there 24/7 to mess with your head.  It's just not feasible.	18

0	Yet another person claiming one is more trustworthy than the other. Do you know the BPD member who posted the tweet? Do you know the journalist who posted his? I doubt that. So you can't make the claim that one is more trustworthy than another without admitting to a bias that isn't based in logic or reasoning. Neither has evidence as far as I'm aware, so to me it seems that both tweets are equally useless.	18

Then they run around promoting the same ideas. It's a mad world, I tell ya.  Under socialism, everything is owned by the state, including the people. *There is no real freedom.* You can only do what the state allows you to do. If you don't see a problem with that, you're never going to understand what I'm saying.	18

I'm a pretty "out of sight, out of mind" kind of person, but this is actually pissing me off.	18
1	Always good to study stuff more.  But assuming "radiation is causing it" is not warranted (until and if there's evidence).  For example, a year or two ago conspiracy theorists were claiming Fuku radiation was causing this:  http://deepseanews.com/2013/12/three-reasons-why-fukushima-radiation-has-nothing-to-do-with-starfish-wasting-syndrome/  (see also http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_26954958/massive-starfish-die-off-pacific-ocean-linked-mystery )  And there's reason to think the radioactive substances from Fuku will have little impact on most of Pacific anyway, such as Pacific coast of USA:  http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/tech/science/environment/2015/04/06/fukushima-radiation-reached-north-american-shores/25322871/   and   http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/fukushima-radiation-measured-on-b-c-shore-for-1st-time-1.3022565	18

Isis is tangible, but their concepts aren't. You can kill the man with a bullet but not the concept that drives him. You don't have to look any further than communists. Millions of communists have been bombed and shot and everything else, yet communism persists.   This is remedial stuff, ratchet up.	18

Why should actual poor people not be allowed to come up to your level?  Or pass you? Is that the fear that someone else's prosperity impairs your own and therefore shitting on that person and stealing their potential makes you feel better about your own failures?	18

This completely removed supply and demand from the equation. Same thing with healthcare, look up what an appendectomy cost in the 1950s. If the government started handing out money to buy cars, you'd better believe a car would cost a million bucks in a few years.  We're supposed to believe that these problems, created when the government stepped in and toppled the free enterprise system, can be fixed with even more government overreach? Ludicrous.	18

JFK was killed because he was going to reveal that the alien presence was real, as his girl friend Marilyn Monroe knew, and thus she herself was killed.  --ZetaTalk, (written Nov 25, 2006) | http://www.zetatalk.com/index/zeta339.htm	18

I think they have core truths which will be revealed to be true when we meet the ETs and get an advanced understanding of the Universe.	18

0	I don't want to get on your level especially after this post it seems your attacking me instead of just making your statement. I am not a Jew hater I am stating a "possible" reason for things and I sent that link as some back up for my statement.  I am not painting you for anything so don't take offense so easily.	18
1	Very well said.  When I heard Al Sharpton suggesting the federal takeover of law enforcement on the radio yesterday I was really taken aback.  I know Sharpton will do or say anything that makes him money but this is just such an insane overreaction to what is going on! It is way to close to fascism, I don't know how anybody could support this. It will be interesting to see who does.	18
1	By de-localizing the police force and the upper-level decision makers, they will no longer be a part of the community. They might as well be foreign troops occupying the city when they clock in. They have very little accountability or empathy compared with local officers who would presumably care about the city they live in and who have to face their fellow citizens on their off time and depend on local business and commerce for food, clothes, entertainment etc.	18

0	The powers that be are Jewish, and this nation needs to go back to Naturalization Act of 1790.   Multiculturalism is a one way street, they want to live near us but we never want to be near them.   I'll take my chances being "disadvantaged" somehow by not importing millions of third worlders.	18
0	So if government can fail and it not be their fault, what incentive do they have to ever do a good job? That is some very backwards thinking. It reminds me of someone with stockholm syndrome defending their captures.	18
1	Yeah, this shit is insane. A friend on my Facebook had a fucking Chocolate Lab that was in its yard, and a patrol officer got out and shot it for seemingly no reason. Their statement is the dog was aggressive (10 year old female in its own yard??) And the officer was forced to subdue. This took place about two days ago.  Even more fucked up is that this officer entered your friends property (for what seems to be no reason and without permission), killed a family member, and will face no repercussions. Fuck that.	18
1	Don't forget, US made tanks(Ford) were supplied to N Korea by the Soviet during the Korean war which led to thousands of American lives.   Similarly US made ships were supplied, via Soviet, during the Vietnam war which led to thousands of American and Vietnamese casualties.  "War is a racket"  Poor people of USA are sent to kill poor of other countries in the name of patriotism and freedom, little do they know that TPTB controls both sides of war.	18
1	&gt; I gave you the perfect explanation.  You gave zero explanation. It will never happen. Its ridiculous. You do know that the president is the head of the military? The idea is preposterous.   &gt; Using words like "laugh-out-loud ridiculous" immediately exposes you as a paid government shill.  You should seek professional help.	18

0	If you want to HaltNWO, you must question the very lie they have propagated to you since birth. This is their biggest trick.

1	Reality is a self correcting illusion filled with zealots who believe anything and will die defending the paradigm of their past.   I truly believe that the current generation is the first one that doesn't have as many qualms of the non-violent habits of other humans (drugs, sexuality, politics).

In the year 2000 over 2 million people had the last name Smith in America.	18

0	That explanation mentions nothing of pacquaios injury, why he told the officials about it on such short notice and why they refused to give him meds for it. There's also the bigger question of why they even let him fight with his torn rotator cuff. You could say he didn't care and just wanted the money, but I don't feel like that's in his character	18

1	I think the real "conspiracy" is that we are having these drills on US soil outside of military bases most likely in preparation for the real thing with American citizens. That should be worrying enough and I'm not quite sure why more people aren't upset by just that fact alone...unless these drills are routine, but I haven't seen anyone post evidence of that yet.	18

1	are you fucking kidding me with this?	18
0	Well, part of the reason it's a race issue is that by and large (1) whites don't mind when cops kill civilians, and (2) whites are dramatically underrepresented proportionally to their proportion of the population. Whites are 63% of the population but only 50% of those killed by cops.   Really, though, the biggest factor is that blacks mind being killed. There is group consciousness on this subject among blacks. Whites, on the other hand, worship the cops and totally support them killing lots of citizens.	18

These are not the results anyone was hoping to achieve. They were dumb mistakes.	18

When a new article that's critical of Israel pops up... watch and see as the first half dozen comments show up. These comments will all contradict what is said, criticize some aspect of the article itself or cast doubt in the reader's mind.  You don't see this reaction in any other types of stories. Once you know what to look for, it really stands out too.	18
0	What about west to east? So you see the discrepancy now how come flight times are the same?	18
0	How does that affect anything I said?  Obviously it's worse. The comparison isn't that his job has worse people than the police force.  His claim was that he doesn't think there are any good cops because they would have done something by now. The point of my comparison was that good employees and good people can sometimes be blocked from getting rid of the bad ones. That doesn't mean there aren't good ones at all.	18
1	No one said you can't use Google to get your propoghanda fix. Or better yet, just watch the MSM news. I like this idea.

1	I knew about Australia, Hawaii is news to me though. Thanks for the heads up. We have a conqueror culture which I think rewards conquest. I really believe that deep down in a lot of peoples hearts they think of it like "well the superior culture won, we have every right to exterminate the left overs."   It might not be so literal but there is a total "us vs the savages" vibe everywhere. You even see it in Israel and Gaza. Essentially one side is completely decimating the other thus the right of might makes their war crimes OK.	18

It sounds like a scenario similar to the old Indian guy that got smashed recently. If you do this you are looking at causing paralysis or death. It is incredible that you call this an accident WITHOUT EVIDENCE based upon police version of events and that this sub upvoted you. The facts are that a disabled man got his head smashed in while in police custody, like the guy in Baltimore. That is a lot of accidents.	18

1	This is standard procedure: either cops, or people dressed as protesters working for cops, incite violence in order to justify the use of force in cracking down on a protest.  It was widespread during the Occupy movements and down in Ferguson.  This happens all the time to discredit the protesters and distract people from their message so vultures like CNN can then report on all the violence instead of having a serious discussion.	18

1	You're right on points one and two that a lot of stuff has been happening that is just criminal. However I totally disagree on point three, I know people in Baltimore and the activism during the Ferguson protests and since has been widespread. The organized protests against the Freddie Gray killing were big and peaceful. I think there has to be a distinction between people who engage in criminality and the majority who do not.  Many of those involved in organizing protests against the police have been on the front line attempting to stop the violence.	18

1	It was a protest, not a riot. Unsurprisingly this has been leading news since it happened, and 17 people got arrested.  On the same day, there was an EDL (racist fascists) march in Walthamstow (east london, rather than central) where 14 fascists got arrested, but it's barely been reported by the right wing mainstream media here.  And it's not "kids not understanding democracy", it's our political system not being a democracy. Less than 25% of Britain voted for the tories, the other 75% are entitled to protest.	18

Just listen to how flushed and excited they get when they go on their stupid jaunts where the general shows off the latest gadgets.

1	Lmao, please  Previous statements actually do affect your credibility, it's good to know when your source is likely batshit crazy  But I guess you don't care about credibility when someone is affirming what you'd like to believe. Those of us who actually like to spread information, on the other hand, need to take into account how that information will be perceived if the source is looked into	18

People are desperate to save their or their loved ones' lives. Also, in functional health care countries like norway, the government would pay for it, so they could charge even more.  * It isn't just one researcher working on the cure. The scientists share their results, in addition to working on teams. Do you really think there's teams of hundres of scientists and no-one would tell the world if they found a way to cure cancer? Nah	18

For example, "NASA discovers somethings that looks like microbial life on Mars but they are not sure yet, and still have to confirm the findings".	18
1	"Invalid Source" is a lazy removal reason there and makes the mods look biased.  However, the title is inaccurate. Daniele Ganser is NOT a professor and has never been.

Daniele Ganser": http://www.danieleganser.ch/biographie.html  He's a post-doc with some teaching assignments:  https://dg.philhist.unibas.ch/departement/personen/person-details/profil/person/ganser/  http://www.egi.unisg.ch/en/lehreweiterbildung  Someone should repost this from a source that doesn't make as many factual mistakes as sott.net	18

1	Because people should always be source-checking to avoid confirmation bias.  Don't just accept "facts" as given.  Assume that everyone has an agenda, including the people you may agree with.

1	&gt;crazy right wing radicals  Wrong, take your pejorative labels and get that trash out of here.  Texas is a state full of hard working people who know their constitutional rights and will fight to support them, and who know that they don't need the federal government to regulate their lives in the manner in which the federal government is attempting to do.  The governor is NOT being paranoid whatsoever, as it is legal to own machine guns in his state.  What state presents the biggest threat to the federal government in terms of their ability to defend themselves through the second amendment?  Texas.  So take your ignorant mouth and shut it.	18

0	Ha.. so typical.  I disagree with you so you call me first a fucking idiot, then a moron.     Admit it, you have no idea what transpired prior to the video.  You have no idea what the law is.   All you know about police work you learned watching TV.   I've forgotten more about this than you will ever learn.   I live in the biggest city in America by the way.	18

1	This generation has a picture of the GOP as warmongers because of Gulf Wars I and II, started by Bush I and II. Clinton's little interventions like Kosovo were never really called wars.  But in the Twentieth century, it was Dems that got us into World Wars I and II, Korea and Vietnam. Nixon is remembered as the big hate of the hippies, but it was his predecessor LBJ that actually turned Kennedy's military assistance into a full-blown war.	18

1	That's like saying fire is not coming back, and is a flawed concept.  Using gold as currency is not some batshit crazy idea(like fiat currency).  But the gold standard was flawed....... to the creators.  It wasn't easily enough manipulated.  Insert fiat currency for a while.  Then they get greedy again now.  So they want to go to a single cashless global currency that can be manipulated and controlled from one place.  This makes it easier to conceal manipulations/frauds, as well as the obvious simplification of dealing with one currency instead of 10 or 20 major currencies.	18

1	We are seeing the "hockey stick effect".  They can't print more money out of thin air because at the amount they have to print money to keep the markets "liquid", they devalue the currency more than it helps.    Then during the defaults the noose gets even tighter.  The "can" can not be kicked much further.  It seems that they are holding things together with band-aids and duct tape to get to a predetermined large scenario event.    I personally expect it to be the largest event in human kinds history.	18

1	The cops have ever reason to want to start a riot.  It gives them justification to make more money, have more status, get more gear, and have less consequences from there actions. The police are absolutely the most likely group to want escalation. When the leadership is not directly in harms way the only reason against, personal harm, also is gone. The tactics in use are antagonistic, they simply need to deploy units to force escalation.	18

0	The subjects of control are part of the determination of that control.  TPTB don't really have that much power as we ascribe to them.  If they make rashly unweighted decisions, they will lose control.    They LIKE being in control of a health vibrant system.  Why would they want to damage it severely, as that only diminishes their power?  They have to steer with consent, and in some sense we're all looking forward to a better, brighter future, so we are the NWO.	18

Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if if the officer had bruising on his foot. If a dog's going to bite you, it's going to clamp down real hard.

0	13.5 years since 9/11, and this is all you have ?  Conspiracy theorists have not developed a SINGLE clear fact or piece of evidence to support any of their many theories.  Just claims and "questions" and innuendo.  And some outright falsehoods.  There were investigations by a zillion agencies and parties inside and outside govt, inside and outside USA.  None of them found a govt conspiracy of any kind, or evidence that refutes the official explanation.	18

1	Reddit is unprofitable on it's own. What's that old saying about if something is free, then you're the product? It's something like that here with reddit's devolution. The product is influence over you the reader, and it's being sold to big corporate/government interests.	18
1	Is this for real? How can people praise American Freedom when it is obviously a joke?	18
0	I used to think the same thing but the past of most religions are chock full of deities, demi-gods, powerful and intelligent beings so far ahead of humanity that they themselves were worshiped as gods. It *really* wouldn't be much of a stretch to use some story of non-intervention to explain their absence and their return if humanity is discovering technologies that could destroy us. Intervention to side-step imminent destruction. I really haven't the slightest clue what lies ahead and how it's going to unfold but in the face of cognitive dissonance, even far out explanations that lead to a more "normalized" perception would be soaked up quite quickly.	18

1	Molten metal pouring from the towers pre-collapse.   The thermodynamic concept of blackbody radiation allows us to deduce the temperature of the molten streams by looking at their color (note: it does not matter what type of metal it is. All metals, once they reach their respective emissive/glowing temperature, will then glow the same color at the same temperature).  The color of those molten streams reveals that they are well above 1400 Celsius (way hotter than jet fuel can ever burn, no matter the conditions). And those towers had no natural gas lines; they were all electric. And accidental electrical arching could not produce that much molten metal before burning itself out.	18

1	We have 5% of the world's population and 25% of the world's prison population. We have far more prisoners than China including Chinese political prisoners. We also have legalized slave labor as enshrined under the Constitution which exempts prisoners from the prohibition on forced labor. And trust me, what's happening in Baltimore has a lot to do with African American men being removed from society for prolonged periods of time to serve sentences for non-violent drug crimes. How can communities function let alone grow and thrive when all the men are taken from them? And at least Stalin's gulags weren't for profit.	18

0	I'm certain that the leading cause of 20th century death has been the Great Depression, American imperialism,  Big Pharma, Big Agriculture, Big Tobacco, poverty induced by wealth imbalance and economic sanctions, and other internal failures of capitalism.  Grade school propaganda is indeed a powerful tool of mind control. It isn't a religion, it's a body of sociological thought that has influenced political philosophy. At its core, it is a critique of capitalism (the religion of selfishness, greed, and expropriation; I jest).	18

Maybe it's an intentional one by power elites or maybe it's a systemic one caused by the financial bottom line of the media companies who need to sensationalize everything in order to sell copy, but it's still a conspiracy because in the end the media distorts reality and people get harmed because of that distortion.	18

1	The belief that "people don't naturally hate each other" is ahistorical, ignorant nonsense. People didn't only begin to engage in conflict with the rise of civilization and government. Conflict has only diminished as civilizations and governments have gotten larger. Steven pinker wrote a book on the body of research that reveals that fact. The idea that governments create conflict - at least at a rate higher than the "natural" amount (which I'm sure you know based on your scientific psychic abilities) - is demonstrably false, and the truth is actually the opposite.	18

If you aren't part of that, you need to move away from it. Baltimore, Ferguson, ect shouldn't receive federal funding for repairs, since it was self-inflicted, not some random natural disaster.

Ask them to define these terms and they refuse, because real American voters don't like actual demonstrative, specified taxation... even on the "rich".  The fact ridiculously wealthy Liberals can decry wealth for political gain, and moreover, the fact Americans can't recognize that cognitive dissonance is very disturbing.	20

1	I'm a Kentucky native and 30 years of McConnell has held this state back in so many ways. He's bought and paid for by big business interests. They hold the coal industry over our heads (accounts for ~2% of the jobs in the state and falling all the time) while the rural areas of the state languish, in desperate need of NEW industries, updated infrastructure, the list goes on. So frustrating to see McConnell re-elected time and time again.	20
0	&gt; Nobody can honestly be this stupid.  You're right.  The only logical deduction is that he is doing this shit on purpose and acts ignorant.  He's got to have a motive here, but it doesn't have to stem from his religion, or lack thereof.  Honestly, Obama is probably an atheist asshole who has one god--himself.	20
1	College has come to mean political programming, not education. College is where a dissolute girl wanders campus for years dragging a mattress in protest. College is where men go to become effete, feckless, effeminate. College is where women go to learn to hate such men as these. The Left owns higher education and leftists are by definition earnest but none too bright. It's no wonder a howling socialist imbecile like Bernie Sanders wants college to be "free" to mold a generation of idiots willing to vote for slavery.	20

1	When I was 18, minimum wage was $5/hr. I got a job at $10/hr. The cost of living was low (because of the minimum wage) so I was able to afford a comfortable lifestyle, as I was a skilled labourer. Now minimum wage is $10.70/hr. I earn $16/hr. But because of inflation (directly due to the increase of minimum wage) it is harder to make ends meet, and those earning minimum wage still can't.	20

If he *did* vote for the new minimum wage, then it's fair to attack him. If he didn't vote for it, it's probably because he's too lazy to vote because he's 25 and working a minimum wage job.  Dammit there I go again!   Sorry. Some folks make it too easy.	20

0	How we treat our LGBT citizens in the United states is not the same issue, nor related to, how ISIS treats homosexuals. It's pure cowardice to move the goal posts in this fashion. The fact that someone running for president cornflates an important national issue of liberty/equality, with international threats from a terrorist group, is an intentional dog whistle tactic to avoid the sensitive issue of equality by supplanting it with national defense.   We need to demand more from our representatives and those running for office, and not pander to stupid arguments.	20
0	And they are the ones who do need to be stopped. Once again my message was go after the extremists who cause violence not the ones who are only offended when Mohumand is depicted.	20
0	But it does mean 'not atheism'.	20
1	Is this the same thing as saying a woman deserves to be raped because she was dressed inappropriate?  Because that's what they sound like.	20
0	Uhh, ok. Can maybe we not see that again?  That would be nice.	20
0	I bet the idea is that $50 benefit accrues to a private interest, and you only have access to that state largess (i.e. Being the owner of a business that can "underpay" (in this example)) if you have made it to a certain level of wealth. If this were an unmitigated "good" for society to support already well off people, then we should proceed with policies like this vigorously. But maybe, just maybe- it isn't.	20
0	So, you'd say that race, gender, and sexual orientation doesn't have any societal issues?	20
0	I do have a clue what's in it, based upon the reactions of those who have read it. If you have any substantial evidence that proves TPP isn't for free trade I'm more than happy to hear it, otherwise I'll just ignore your baseless insults.	20
0	That wouldn't be productive though. It's specifically starting a culture war for the sake of it. Even the most ardent free speech advocates (I'm guessing) will concede that a photo of full frontal nudity should not be shown mid afternoon in times square.	20

1	&gt; If he doesn't win the nomination I may sit out or vote for a third party.  I wouldn't go that far. There are some other great candidates as well. But if it's another milquetoast RINO like Jeb Bush, Lindsey Graham, Christie, or Kasich, I would tend to agree.	20
1	More than Obama in his wildest dreams, the corrupt Clinton cabal can reward its friends and punish its enemies. Orwellian George owes all to his political masters, his abject loyalty is assured. ABC knows this and puts a price tag for that Clinton connection at $105 millions.	20

1	We protect the identities of accusers and minors, and it does nothing to stop fair trials from taking place. We should extend this protection to the accused as well. You cannot have "innocent until proven guilty" when the court of public opinion renders a verdict before the trial even begins.	20
1	There really isn't a KKK any more. There's a loose affiliation of various groups that call themselves that. I think it totals 3,000 people or so now. It's not the KKK at all - just in name only, and the last time they did anything violent was in the 1980's.   (insert fact that the real KKK were all Democrats here)	20
0	Wow. Lol. They make the Left look totally depraved.	20
1	If I may, I'd like to rephrase your sentiments a little: "I believe that any conservative who doesn't have a problem with the current police situation is misinformed or has been misled."	20

1	Don't you find it insane that being neutral used to be the job of the media?  Journalism is mostly dead.  You'd get better moderation from a high school debate club.	20
0	Don't play dumb and ask for extraneous details. The burden is on anyone asking to disprove the following:  If the city has been under Democrat leadership for fifty years, yet Baltimore is the opposite of prosperous. Political leaders/Public offices and their respective governing styles claim to be able to deliver prosperity to their citizens, why is this not happening in Baltimore?   The leadership and policies of Baltimore are under question here..  Or maybe you can explain why Baltimore's Democratic-party governing style is not to blame for Baltimore's lack of prosperity.	20

1	She's racist and hates poor people!	20
1	How tone deaf can Fox possibly be??  The republican brand desperately needs some new blood, someone with some new ideas, not more of the same tired establishment candidates running on the same tired platform.  If I have to watch the republicans destroy one of their own again, I'm voting third party.	20

1	He's awful.  Please do not vote for this clown.	20
0	No.   So long as Romney paid as much as he owed to the IRS, his tax returns were none of my business, nor were they any reflection of his ability to lead. Personally, I quite liked Romney, and would have preferred him to any of the current candidates- save maybe Paul's stance on the NSA.	20

1	Is r/conservative actually defending a child molester? You don't make a mistake on 5 different people.   Edit:  He was taken to a State Trooper, who was a family friend, and no charges were filed. The State Trooper in question is currently serving a 56 year prison term for child pornography.	20
0	Great article, and yes it's true that lots of people tragically commit suicide because they've been deluded by cultural marxists into believing that hacking their genitals away is the key to their problem. It's a shame that their lives are used as pawns in the left-wing's game to destroy any and all values that are even remotely religious based or have an ounce of decency.	20

1	I'll bet they looked *real hard*, too.  Honest. /s	20
1	&gt; But given how Elizabeth Warren hates it (based on what she has seen, and to my understanding can't talk about) - I am all for it.   Nobody who voted knows what's in it.  The text of the bill was kept secret from most of the Senate--and it was kept secret from the public.  Regardless of where you stand on free trade, the very process and transparency of this vote should tell you to oppose it.	20

1	By smoking weed you are not infringing on the rights of others, which is fine, legalize it.  By aborting a child the mother is taking the right to life away from a child.  I find that most pro-choicers can have widely different opinions as to when the right to life begins. Which I take as a good sign they are being terribly subjective.	20
1	Meanwhile there is no dileneation between news and opinion when you have Rachel Maddow leading election news coverage over at MSNBC.   It's hard to take any criticism about "misinformation" coming from "Faux News" when MSNBC, al-Jazeera, Huffington Post, and RT continue to exist.	20
0	Guessing this is going to be a kangaroo court designed to find the officers guilty.  Everything I've read have made it clear that it was a legal arrest.	20
1	IMO his knife being illegal is irrelevant to the case.	20
1	That's not what he said at all. It's still 100% legal to verbally oppose not only same-sex marriage, but also interracial marriage. You can legally deny the holocaust and demand a return to slavery. What you can't do is actively discriminate against people based on those biases.	20

0	But realistically, to the average American, that threat is no more than getting struck by lightning, wouldn't you agree?	20
1	Servants necessarily don't make eye contact with royalty. That is just rude. Little people naturally grovel before their betters. Rich and politically privileged people haven't time for the cries of commoners. The Clinton's don't hate poor people. The Clinton's are so insulated they just don't believe poor people exist.   The funny thing is these allegations are examples of poor treatment of like-minded liberals, fellow travelers loyal to the Foundation. If Clinton toadies are treated poorly, one can only imagine the rough usage reserved for "enemies" of Clinton Inc.	20
0	Agree with that until "Christian". I exclusively see Christians upvoted and atheists downvoted in recent times.	20
0	Being gay is not normal.. prove me wrong.	20
1	Apparently the concepts of free-market economics and supply and demand are completely beyond the reasoning skills of many people. Worse yet, some understand it but exploit the ignorance of others for personal gain. Which is it in your case Bernie - stupid or exploitative?	20

1	&gt;  literal objective of planned parenthood is to prevent children from growing up in broken homes.  No.  [Read their mission statement](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/who-we-are/mission).  They're about preventing *unwanted* births with no regard whatsoever to whether the mother is single or not, it has nothing to do with "broken homes".  Democrat programs [actually incentivize single motherhood](http://time.com/27708/my-neighborhood-makes-it-easier-to-get-pregnant-than-to-go-to-college/).	20

1	My guess is that people still use the ER as their primary care and were less afraid of going because they are now insured. Unfortunately, those same people were not educated on preventative care or the benefits of establishing a primary doctor. I bet if people were better informed in the first place that a co-pay is cheaper than an ER bill, ER visits would not have increased.	20
1	Anyone that was able to remain objective on the topic would have (and will continue to withhold judgment) until all the facts have been revealed. If you "saw" this coming, it means you speculated about something that you had no idea of knowing, most likely from preconceived prejudices.	20
1	1. San Bernardino county is the LARGEST county in the nation, how you are blaming the unemployment and economic status on a republican in the BLUEST STATE IN THE NATION is beyond me.  2. In those 10 poorest, how many states have   All republican council leaders?  3. Why is it that /r/politics gets away with pointing fingers all day, yet /r/conservative gets criticized for it?	20

1	The baby doesn't get to decide what to do with their body? The baby isn't "their body". It's a separate life living inside their body. They only have the right to chose whether to take care of the baby or not. They don't have the right to take the child's life.	20

1	No kidding. Go to /r/politics, search 'Rand Paul' and glance through the comments for each one. I am not exaggerating when I say the top comment is usually along the lines of "I don't always agree with him but..."  How many times do people have to say that until he becomes 'cool enough'?	20

1	Because the left HATES Our Judeo-Christianity influence so much, that they will literally side with anti-American EVIL over their own fellow citizen if given the choice/when the rubber meets the road. the ones at the top know full well what they are doing, and know full well that their influence is destructive to the country, but helpful to their cause. But the ones at the "grass roots" level, i.e., our friends, family, coworkers, etc., are either mentally deranged or just purely ignorant or stupid in addition to being hateful.	20
1	I noticed a recent uptick in Jeb articles on liberal/"progressive" subreddits. They acknowledge him much more than we do.   I guess even though we have 15 diverse candidates, they want to insist on the no choice model. They call themselves democrats, but they forgot how to practice democracy.	20
0	&gt;Freddie Gray sustained his fatal injuries inside a police van when his head slammed into a bolt in the back of the vehicle.  From [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/30/baltimore-police-van-freddie-gray-stop).  I'm not saying that he definitely sustained the injury from the bolt by throwing himself against the walls, but from a purely physical perspective, a man can throw himself against a wall just as hard as if he were thrown by someone else or thrown against the wall from a "rough ride." The idea that the nature of his injury only points to one preconceived cause, as you are claiming, is based on nothing but speculation and prejudice.	20
0	Not really.  I am still in contact with a lot of my political contacts after last year's races (I helped run Stewart Mill's campaign in the MN-08 district).  All of their internal polling and analysis show that he will shift above Hilary within 6 months.	20
0	&gt; Of course, when a study disproves common sense, that study is almost certainly politically motivated pap.  Do you have any evidence for this claim?   &gt;America has produced generations of welfare recipients who are no more keen to work than Hillary is to produce her secret server.  Again, do you have any actual empirical evidence that proves that people on welfare don't want to work? Because I've just provided some pretty clear cut evidence that the opposite effect occurs.	20
0	Those states must have just realized that for your argument to have any relevance.	20
1	To add on this, [as documented in this book](http://www.threefeloniesaday.com/Youtoo/tabid/86/Default.aspx), the U.S. legal code is so convoluted and complex that nearly everyone commits some kind of "crime" on a near-daily basis, so anyone who may want to target you for something can pretty easily prosecute you if they're able to monitor you.	20

I may be wrong or misguided in that belief, however I hope not.	20
0	Teenagers who want to change gender have to go through a series of psych evaluations, are usually set to a hormone regiment, and are usually harassed and bullied by their peers when they come out. Do you really think your average kid is going to take all that just to see the girls locker room?	20

Radical Islam is *millions* of people who believe that 'Allah Hates Fags', so they execute them. Islamists are an annoyance, and they're violent.   It's a pretty large distinction.	20

1	&gt;Police brutality is a real issue, and shouldn't be seen as a liberal or conservative one either.  The problem, though, is that people are trying to portray police brutality as a national problem with the institution despite the fact that it is statistically rare.	20
1	I wish that liberals like this would realize their behavior does no good whatsoever to rectifying their perceived injustices.  All this kind of thing does is alienate people and stir up hatred.  It seems like the entire liberal narrative is about getting even for past events.  Real or imagined.	20

0	I have nothing against Rand (other than his isolationism), and would vote for him if he was nominee, but what really makes you say this?  His ideas?  He really has no track record of leadership or accomplishments.  Ideas are great, but let's give him some time to learn if he can turn ideas into accomplishments.  A couple of years as a senator is not enough experience (see Mr. Obama as case study #1).	20

0	As he should've. I don't think that is unreasonable. Why would a president encourage the opposite? Today is not the day of the Whiskey Rebellion or Ohio State. The National Guard is fine and dandy, they do us all a great service, but restraint on the side of the government, federal and state, is what is necessary *right now.* Our government exists to give fair order. With that said, I don't think President Obama's comment was out of line.	20

1	We don't know the jeweler's policy on refunds.  The fact that he initially didn't refund them when they asked and only did so after being threatened might suggest that he doesn't usually give refunds.  Also the fact that he was threatened and harassed at all is a problem.	20

0	Lincoln's war severely damaged the power of the States and hugely boosted the power of the federal government. If you're a conservative, you should appreciate the fallout of the Civil War and its impact on the balance of government. Abolishing slavery makes for a heroic cause when you impose modern-day morality on the 1800's, but what was the price? An *incredibly* bloody war, a destroyed infrastructure (mostly in the South), and a roided-up federal government that impacts (negatively, IMO) the future of our country today.	20

1	Sigh.   &gt; Was it proven that the dude didn't rape her?  To everyone that matters satisfaction, yes. A long time ago. She was stalking *him* more than the other way around, and she sounds like she has some other issues.   Nungesser has chosen (under the wise counseling of his attorneys) to not sue Emma Sulkowicz, A.K.A. 'Mattress Girl'. She has no money. It's a 'blood from a turnip' kinda thing.   He did choose to sue Columbia, and wisely waited until graduation to do so. He has a real case against Columbia which will probably be settled out of court.	20
1	It's always easy to say that when you are not poor. And neither am I but I do consider myself lucky as well as persistent. There are people that will be poor by either a string of bad luck, subpar abilities and crashed confidence. I support those people..  Now of course there is this other side of the spectrum where people just don't care and live off benefits. I don't think that anyone likes those.	20

0	Good advice from Thomas Sowell.  See also: Proverbs 22:6  &gt;Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.

Not only did she not follow through, she absolutely stopped contact and returned all the money she borrowed.  It may sound like it is nice that she returned the money. However, she definitely benefitted from the larger pool of money for a long while. As it was returned *after* she won her position.  We were used and discarded. It makes me feel dirty remembering.	20

For example, there is no specific provision in the constitution regarding marriage, nor abortion. What you consider a civil right is something the Feds have no business imposing.	20
1	Currently a debater on the same circuit. Just to clarify, it's best in the nation, not world. And that's a bit misleading since APDA is really only an organization in the northeast.  Don't mean to discredit anything he did, the circuit (as my flair suggests) has a huge liberal bias so that much success from a conservative is even more impressive imo.	20
0	&gt;So if you take away net neutrality, cable prices will rise and service quality will decline.   a.) That's not what net neutrality actually is. Just a buzzword.  b.)

0	And he set the precedent that the federal government may destroy your state if your state wishes to secede, thereby stripping the States of a huge bargaining chip. It used to be the federal government had to answer to the States. After the civil war, the States had to answer to the federal government.  No, Lincoln didn't single-handedly bloat the federal government. He just paved the path for bloating the government. Since then, he has been aided by such "heroes" as FDR (who has some good points) and LBJ (my least favorite president).	20
0	The "conservative cause" has no say in Baltimore, or were you not aware of this? For 50+ years, democratic policies have molded Baltimore into the shot hole it is now. Rampant unemployment reaching 9%, just in 2013 the unemployment rate for black between 20-24 was 37%(!). This city will receive ZERO sympathy from me, the council has 12 DEMOCRATIC COUNSELORS, NOT.ONE.REPUBLICAN. Perhaps the citizens of Baltimore would have been better off with some bipartisanship? Instead the cops are vilified for the failed democratic policies the city has instituted the last 50 years.	20

So we Polk sent an envoy to discuss border disputes and annexation, Mexico refused the envoy and then attacked the American troops stationed in Texas.

0	First off, you're making a false equivalency argument. Just because liberals aren't welcome to come and challenge Conservatism in this forum (it says this in the sidebar which you haven't read) doesn't mean that this sub is an "echo chamber."  The point is that this forum should be a place for Conservatives to discuss political and cultural issues (again in the sidebar). We aren't sheep that circlejerk the entire time. There can be debate among conservatives about any number of things. We have neo-cons and libertarian conservatives in this forum, for example.	20
1	That's why you do see a lot of liberals supporting Bernie.  A lot of us don't really like Hillary and hate that she's been "crowned" as our nominee.    Also, a lot of liberals only support her because they think she's the only viable candidate democrats have and would rather have Hillary, with all her faults, than any Republican.  Its not really them being illogical, but just sort of sadly practical lesser of two evils sort of thing.	20

0	One confusion is that Nazism is "far-right" that is completely false. All you have to do is read the name. "National German Socialist Worker's Party" They banned guns, free speech, and had heavy regulations. Modern Democrats are as close to Nazis and they are to Communists, which, the combined deaths of these two ideologies killed well over 70 million people in the 20th century.	20

0	&gt; Religious arguments have no place in law.  **No** place?  I think that's a lot overstated.  The first amendment in our Constitution (i.e. the very foundation of our laws) guarantees that religious freedom will be protected from encroachment by the state.  I think it's clear that there is at least *some* room for religious arguments when considering how laws would impact religious freedom.  However, we need not rely on religious argument alone in this case.  There are several purely secular and logically sound arguments that have been made in support of traditional marriage.	20

1	That's nice. They can pretend they are a girl. But when it comes to bathrooms, official/government paperwork - they are a male. Their dna says they are a male. Just because they associate with that, doesn't change the facts. Just like someone who is an anorexic, doesn't change the fact they are skinny.	20
0	"Thoughtcriminal" is the new "t" word.	20
0	&gt; Problem is life isn't fair and we are not equal. This is inherent in a free society.  This is one concept of freedom, [negative liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_liberty). There is another form of freedom, [positive liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_liberty) in which individuals are free because they possess the economic mobility necessary to be free.	20
1	Libs know this.  One of the reasons they are pushing for a higher minimum wage is because union wages are based on the percentage the union wage is against the minimum wage.  If the min wage is low they don't get as much. Meaning union bosses don't get as much. Meaning Democrats don't get add much.	20
1	"Quoting former Nation of Islam leader and New Black Panther Party chairman, Kallid Abdul Muhammad, Sheppard wrote of whites, 'we give them 24 hours to get out of town by sundown.'"  Doesn't "sundown" come twice in 24 hours? Shouldn't it be simply "we give you till sundown to git outta town"? Threats should be concise and to the point. Confusing, muddled, unlettered threats just cause people to not take one serious or else just think one a fool.	20

1	Exactly. Even if Gray, who is undeniably a dirt bag, was doing just that; the cops didn't secure him and he died. The force required to cause the injury to his neck isn't something a man can do shackled up. If the cops had buckled him in, and on top of that not arrested him for no reason (being now that the knife wasn't even a switchblade) he wouldn't be dead. Officer's are accountable for their actions.	20
1	Boy, the liberals that lurk this sub sure do hate it when you poke fun at their new king.	20
1	It's not a good time to be a firefighter in the FDNY. There's also a [black diversity hire](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3085400/FDNY-company-want-cowardly-rookie-sacked-running-away-scene-fires-report-claims.html) who refuses to fight fires.  But isn't it a great time for diversity. We have under-qualified women and blacks that can proudly wear the badge of the FDNY. Sure some people will die because they cannot/refuse to fulfill their duties, but at least we can celebrate the fruit salad we've created with artificial quotas and lowered standards.	20

0	You apparently missed this paragraph, I am sure it was accidental on your part.  &gt;A closer look at these numbers finds that Pelosi remains, as she has been for years, the most enthusiastically disliked, with 38% who have a Very Unfavorable opinion of her. Reid’s next with Very Unfavorables of 30%, while 27% feel that way about Boehner. McConnell, who just took over the majority leader job from Reid in January following the GOP takeover of the Senate in the last election, is viewed Very Unfavorably by 23%.	20
0	Of course she did. There is 0% chance that she would ever live in that neighborhood.	20
0	It actually *isn't* enough to live on there because they have flooded that sleazy town with so much pork the cost of everything keeps going through the roof despite what happens in the rest of the world. Their power to confiscate and print money makes it the only city that is recession proof.	20
1	You know it.  Look at Uber trying to fight to stay alive because the super smart government determined it's not fair to taxi companies.	20
0	Because I believe focusing on things like this instead of on the actual merits of these people as leaders is anathema to democracy.	20
0	At this point I think the vast majority of Republicans could beat Hillary in the general, but we are creating a power vacuum by burying Hillary.  It opens up to some Marxist psycopath like the Mayor of Baltimore types, the not-communist-but-I-can-see-it-from-here Elizabeth Warren, the boob Joe Biden or the evermore lost Air Cannon Nancy Pelosi.  This is the garbage that aren't your grandfather's lost hippy children, these chickens have come home to roost and are anchored in cornerstones of government.

0	None of that is rooted in personal experience though, it's gotten from rappers, movie stars, etc.   I would dare them to start listing specific examples of times where they felt the media was incompetent, corrupted, pandering, you'd have dead air.  This new generation is even worse than the boomers in that, they don't even trust people who are supposed to be trust worthy or honest (Cronkite, etc), they trust those who they think are likable and cool (Jon Stewart).  It's a third hand account, which is incredibly dangerous.	20

0	How is this even remotely close to being Jim Crow? The very simple fact that a part of the group is dictating the narrative and has the power to make it into actual law kinda defeats your point. Do you even think racism exists? It's not really former power when it permeates through every facet of society. White on white discrimination is the more appropriate term.	20

1	&gt; When will Republicans who care about winning national elections, or actually governing, stop thinking of Fox as a help and start viewing it as a hindrance, and what will happen when they do?  Liberals want Republicans to win elections?  And they can help themselves by getting rid of Fox News?    Each day I grow more thankful that a certain percentage of the population can think for themselves and don't believe what they read in the media.	20
1	My favorite from that election was the New York Times backing McCain all the way through the primaries. As soon as he clenched the nomination they launched a hit piece as a front page story about him having an affair with a Lobbyist (during an election where lobbyists were the devil). The story was completely fabricated but the damage had been done.  There is no bias here, move along	20
1	&gt;“Why,” he asks, “can’t two consenting people make arrangements for less than x dollars per hour?”  This gets me.  When it comes to sex, most everyone in the city says Consent!  When it comes to economics though, private citizens and firms certainly can't be trusted to work out the arrangement that is best for both parties.	20
0	That sounds like an completely unsupported personal opinion to me.	20
0	But if it came down to bush vs clinton, would you really vote 3rd party?  It would amount to a vote for Hillary, essentially... and I'm not sure I can do that.  The party is essentially calling our bluff, knowing that none of us want to see Clinton in office.  They are counting on us to vote for the lesser of two evils.  And you know what? They're probably right.  I can't stand the thought of Bill Clinton's wife in the White House, and I'll do anything to prevent it, even vote for George Bush Part III.   We're helpless once we lose the primary.	20
0	The quote is about the freedom to choose what she can do with her body not whether she can break the law. She isn't trying to break the law, she is trying to challenge the law itself. She hasn't gotten an abortion yet and likely won't get a ruling by the time the 3 days are up. Meaning she will wait 3 days and then get an abortion.	20
0	I don't know how I feel about the Supreme Court being used as a cudgel to point out how out of touch the administration is. In my view, the Supreme Court doesn't have a whole lot of legitimacy either, what with their apparent role as unelected, unaccountable philosopher kings. Unless of course you are trying to say that Obama is so far out there that a group as whimsical and foolish as the Supreme Court is turning against him.	20
1	There are both medical and psychological causes for gender identity disorders. It doesn't sound like a fun way to live - especially at high school age.   That doesn't mean that the girls want an unwanted wiener hanging around in the locker room, either. On the other hand, a teen suffering from a gender identity disorder would be uncomfortable in either locker room, and the teenage boys wouldn't want the kid in their locker room, either.   There's not always an easy answer to a complicated problem.	20
1	One thing that's mystifying is how supposed "liberals" are crawling up over each other to limit free speech over this.  If someone had shot up a gay pride parade, would they feel the same way?  "Don't poke the bear?" Hell, no.  Just goes to show, the left is populated with inconsistent idiots.  But of course, inconsistent idiots are okay with that.	20

1	Apparently, since our schools are failing a minority of their students, society must necessarily be restructured to accommodate that benighted minority. Restructured not to lift up the bottom, rather it is everyone else who must be reeducated till they conform to the collective cowardice called Political Correctness.	20
0	Really? You are going to argue with me on mutually exclusive? Mutually exclusive means if one event happens the other can't occur. While its true that the opposite of mutually exclusive is if one event happens the other event HAS to happen (if p then q), these two are not the only two ways to describe the world. See conditional independence.	20

(but then that's what the Left wants) Third once we move towards totalitarianism and the Goverment flexes that muscle to silence disagreement... then we are inevitably headed towards a civil war between the government and its people	20
1	More or less that is what the liberals want.  Complete adherence to an ideology, as for Sweden, the people that have any morals or values should leave.  Leave that country to rot and decay, because inherent destruction is coming.  I feel bad for the innocents that will suffer because of it.	20

0	Obviously the guy didn't do anything to deserve being called racist or a bigot. These guys that open carry rifles piss me off for a different reason, though. It's just counter-productive in the worst way. The biggest obstacle to the gun rights movement is the public perception of gun-owners as crazy rednecks, and carrying around a fully loaded rifle with ammunition pouches only intensifies that perception. He's confirming their bias against gun owners because he just wants to be as in-your-face as possible. It's selfish and short-sighted. I just wish people like this guy would realize that even if something is your right, it's not always the right thing to do.	20

0	Sanders is literally Ron Paul. Nobody really likes him outside of the protected confines of whatever social media platforms his supporters can astroturf.  No, Sanders' role is to test the waters for Elizabeth Warren. Get the american public used to outright hostile attitude towards actual capitalism.

1	Ok here's a short breakdown.  Hillary testified a couple of years ago.  Rand Paul heard some reports that the annex that was attacked was used to move weapons to other countries. He asked Hillary about it who denied it.  Judicial Watch strikes again and wins a FOIA request stating that lethal weapons were in fact being shipped to Syrian rebels and that high level officials knew about. I don't know that Hillary is 100% confirmed as knowing about this but as Sec of State she of course did.   As far as what rebels were getting the weapons we don't know but it wouldn't surprise me if those dipshits were sending them to ISIS.	20
1	No.  Liberals have the automatic high horse, which is why Liberal Tolerance is defined as they are right, Conservatives are wrong...instantly.

1	I thought it was sort of the opposite, that the First Amendment protects us *from* the government. &gt; Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  To me, that sounds like the First Amendment is explicitly limiting the government from doing certain things, not limiting citizens from doing certain things towards the government.	20
1	Someday when the money runs out and these college attending children have to leave the schools and enter the working world, they'll realize just how dumb shit like 'microaggressions' are.

They think that if you're black, you have an obligation to agree with their socially parasitic and disastrous policies.    Allowing black people think for themselves is something they cannot and will not consider, they consider blacks the property of the left, and they just want to keep Toby on the plantation at all costs.	20
0	The shock is caused by presuming that since we like democracy, everyone should.  Just because we prefer rampant sexuality outside of marriage, doesn't mean everyone does.  Just because we believe that men and women should be equals in the family unit doesn't mean everyone does.  Other societies and cultures should live under the system that they prefer.  If it's a dictatorial islamic state run by what we consider stone age thinking, who are we to judge.	20
0	Those countries have at most 9 million people, more realistically about 5, a much smaller Gdp, a much larger government, and a lot less responsibilities on the world stage. They're not super powers, and most of their military protection comes from the U.S. Just because something works moderately well with at most 9 million people, doesn't mean it's going to work nearly as well with 318.9 million people. And as far as we know, it's not sustainable. Those countries could be bankrupt in 30 years because they spend too much and guarantee too much to their populace that they can't afford come an economic recession or depression.	20

I've benefited from the NC economy though, so I can't really complain too much personally.	20

0	40 hours a week at minimum wage isn't a basic living wage, especially with a family, especially if you're a single parent, so you would still be eligible for welfare of many kinds.  In fact, people work more than 40 hours a week and still won't have a basic living wage.  People on welfare definitely aren't obese because they're eating too much.  They can barely make ends meet, even with paychecks and welfare.	20

1	One problem with r politics is that if you post an article (and copy and paste the headline perfectly) and then the editors or writers change the name of the article, and then the mods check that link, they are going to remove your article for breaking their "no headlines that aren't direct quotes" rule.  It also doesn't matter if the OP is the editor/writer, and changed the headline themselves, they're STILL going to use the "not quoted" rule to pull your post.  Headlines change, that rule is unsustainable, but for now it's just incredibly convenient.	20

0	Because a percentage is stated as of the moment of the data it is calculated.  Giving it out is precisely what has been being done with QE.  Those dollars have done nothing for those in need as I am sure you will agree.  Welfare, which is what you are advocating, in fact enslaves and provides the ability to say "I give up," "I'm OK living at the minimum. I'll vote for you, just let me eat."  That is inherently abhorrent.	20

Neither do other high-profile idiots, just like Jeb Bush and Bill O'Reilly don't represent all conservatives. Don't be hateful of others just because they have different ideas or values than you.	20

0	Great candidates that aren't polling anywhere close to winning an election, sadly, endorsing them over the person who represents the same state as you is just politically ignorant.   The incarceration rate is definitely economic. Poor urban youth can't afford the representation like middle class people. As a "constitutionalist" you should care about the incarceration of victimless, nonviolent "criminals".   If you don't think people that serve their time deserve their rights back, then you don't care much for freedom. Especially since most felons are perpetrators of nonviolent crimes. That's pretty statist.	20

1	I go to a Catholic school and in my religion class were doing a unit on Islam. My teacher kept telling us about how Islam is the most stereotyped and misunderstood religion and that we Americans treat them poorly (she's Irish) but then I brought up Benghazi and how Americans are persecuted. Even the liberal students in my class hate her though, so I guess that's something.	20
1	Not just hard work, but *smart* work.  "Liberal" rhetoric absurdly fantasizes that the hardest-working people are the poorest.  While there are a lot of lower income people who work really hard in dead-end jobs, many people who are middle class and up got there by working their asses off *in ways that pay off in the long term*.  "Liberals" will point to a person who inherited wealth and use that to suggest that "rich" people are generally idle.  There is no logic to be found in that reasoning.	20

You're saying that you don't think she has sources because you don't see them, but you don't see them because you won't buy the book that would have them in it, and you won't buy the book because you don't see any sources?  Joseph Heller always gave me a headache.	20

None of those earthquakes caused damage (most couldn’t even be felt). Statistically speaking, fracking causes earthquakes 0.002 percent of the time. In other words, zero.	20

Liberals refuse to admit that the "wolves" even exist. The notion that there are people out there willing to do them harm is so frightening and foreign to them that it just doesn't resonate. They will never admit the wolves are real until they are at their throat.	20

We **lost** when Boehner and McConnell were re-elected.  I cannot think of one thing this Republican Congress has accomplished that I support.  On the other hand, they passed this abomination and ratified Obama's executive amnesty.  They have sold us out to foreign interests.	20

Obviously it could not be because of his race, in fact the officer charged with murder is black.  So why would they deliberately kill freddie ?  Because he was a career criminal and they all agreed it was his day to go ?  Do you honestly believe that ?	20
0	Come on. Trickle down economics is a scam; no more tax cuts should be given to the rich. Lets cut the "free" trade agreements, force corporations to bring back jobs that pay a liveable wage to people, and stop trying to blame citizens who are born into the cycle of poverty. The profit-incentive has ruined the middle class. Let's not elect someone who will continue the scam.	20

It is easy to argue in hypotheticals trying to disprove someone else's opinion, but so far you have given absolutely nothing to back up your opinion.  Like I've said many times, this debate is full of opinions and very little science and unless you can scientifically prove to me that a fetus is a living human I don't want the government making decisions for us.

Then they can drop the claims that they present objective news all day, and can drop the "fair and balanced"  (without the word news after,  so there's that) and "real journalism"  slogans if their big hosts are opinion pundits.  I'm nitpicking yeah, just don't see how the channel is defensible.   Msm in general is trash but anyway...	20
0	I think it's a worthwhile strategy. Besides her female genitalia and the identity politics that will be played non-stop by her campaign, her "experience" is her next biggest selling point.

Not only did he answer in the affirmative, but he suggested Hillary Clinton would do the same.      That's not what happened. Bush was asked if he would have invaded Iraq, to which he said yes just like Hillary Clinton did. How could Ingraham be so misinformed?	20

On the other hand, "charity" is a very generous term for the Clinton Foundation, which seems to exist solely to provide a slush fund for the Clinton family, and a semi-legal way for foreign groups to buy influence with the former Secretary of State.  As Iowahawk said on Twitter a few weeks ago: "The Ford Foundation exists to give away Ford's money. The Gates Foundation exists to give away Bill Gates' money. The Clinton Foundation exists to give the Clintons money."	20

Also, you're putting things on a hierarchy too. When you look at the amount of people who die from committing illegal abortions and you go "it's the price to pay" you're putting the baby above the person.    so you go "babies&gt;people"    and I go "people&gt;babies"	20

I'm interpreting it as people were asked if they support criminalizing hate speech, of which 51% of Democrats support so and 37% of Republicans, which is different than repealing the entirety of the first amendment.  People weren't asked if they support repealing the First Amendment (which is more than just Freedom of Speech.)	20

It's low hanging fruit they can easily pick to garner votes from an otherwise simple minded voter.

It's actually a good strategy in our current environment where our education levels are seriously lagging among developed nations.	20

I have no obligation to my employer to stick around when there are openings in my area that I qualify.  They have no obligation to keep me as well.

0	&gt;According to Swift, from a purely instrumental position the answer is straightforward. ‘One way philosophers might think about solving the social justice problem would be by simply abolishing the family. If the family is this source of unfairness in society then it looks plausible to think that if we abolished the family there would be a more level playing field.’     **THIS** is from the actual source article. This is his actual solution to inequality. Abolish families because healthy families create unfair advantages. Seriously, screw this guy and his 'social justice' sympathizers.	20
0	Liberal high school / professor?  What does that kind of assumption get you?  Is it for your own peace of mind?  Does the fact that I went to a private Christian school in Georgia, and then on to the university of Dallas somehow change how you view anything I wrote?   Education teaches objectivity, logic, and reason.  Failing to use these tools would be an affront to my years of learning.   The founding fathers intentionally established a secular nation. To say otherwise is to insult their intelligence and sacrifice.	20
0	Yah.  The idea that food stamp recipients don't work is incredibly simplistic and wrong.  As you can see in [this Wall Street Journal article](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/04/13/get-a-job-most-welfare-recipients-already-have-one/), most people on food stamps receive one or more paychecks and *still* can't make ends meet because wages have not increased at the same rate as food, utilities, and other goods.  You can have two minimum wage jobs and still be in poverty.  The biggest abuse of welfare is big corporations using the welfare system to avoid paying their hourly employees a living wage.	20

Answering it directly as you suggest gives legitimacy to the premise, as if there were some reason or evidence to believe that he *does* have personal hatred. An intelligent debater when faced with a loaded question like this attacks the premise to delegitimize the question and the person asking it for being a shill not a journalist.

Yet, despite this fact, they still will keep a gun. Remember, emotionally unstable Gorge Zimmerman was a liberal Democrat who reportedly voted twice for Obama and he can't get shut of shooting or bring shot at. Our inner cities are awash in the blood of gun crime victims but they vote reliably for Democrats. These Democrats ban guns but keep their guns as do the heavily armed voters who keep electing the gun-banning Democrats. Democrats are indeed strange, mentally misshapened creatures.	20

1	Someone at a Tea Party rally held up a sign about watering the tree of liberty (with the blood of tyrants) while legally displaying firearm, so yeah it's pretty much the same thing as rioting and destroying property. /s	20
1	the same type they were in college?	20
0	Neither would I, but I would side with statistical science that shows that not having both a father and mother increases the chances for problems.	20
1	I'm sure all the guns used were perfectly legal too. Am I allowed to call them "thugs" or is that racist?	20
0	No Rand, the hawks did not create ISIS.   Straight out of the left's talking points there Rand. ISLAM is the problem, not us.	20
0	Race has to be apart of the discussion. When you're white you don't need an identified. If you do a Google search for man, all (or at least mostly)  images of white men will appear. You have to add race to find a man of any other color. So yes. Race is a huge issue that you deal with unless you're white which, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm assuming you are	20

1	Jesus dude this was a person, what if somebody was saying this about your kid?	20
1	No, I'm pretty sure that a $15 minimum wage would hurt plenty of "Ma &amp; Pa" places.  Frankly, it would kill most if not all of the "Ma &amp; Pa" places and leave us with nothing but billion dollar Multinational Corporations who can afford to,replace their minimum wage workers with robots.	20
1	Jeb Bush supports Obamacare?  REALLY?  Edit: Jeb* not Jen LOL	20
0	Less government involvement in the markets outside of regulating anti-competitive practices.   And, I think more importantly, getting corporate interests out of the pockets of politicians.	20
0	I say we just change all of Bernies TP for the single ply recycled TP that is in most GOV buildings. He get's a base model Chevy Spark to drive.  If he has a child living at home, he gets a Captiva. If he has 3 Children he get's a Chevy Venture.  Dockers suits, and wrangler relaxed fit jeans, dark blue, unwashed.  He get's a 32 inch tv with 10 state run channels.	20
1	My condolences,  Mr. Vice President.	20
0	And the jury will. I read your narrative of events. You failed to include anything that would substantiate a murder charge. What happened during that shirt time between riding the bike and the injury. Sorry, but our judicial system needs more than that. Likewise, breaking protocols is not the same as breaking the law. That could open them up to department duscipline and civil charges, but not criminal prosecution.   In short, the defense will have a field say with what gas been presented this far and those cheering today will be pissed a short time from now because of prosecutorial overreach.	20
0	No, he named one... You lose.	20
1	Honestly, that slop is extremely effective.  You can only turn the other cheek for so long before you realize you're getting steamrolled.  Alinsky was a piece of shit, but he knew what he was doing.	20
0	Will I be making money if you pay me $10? I'll need transportation, something to put the excrement into, food to replace the energy used, wear and tear on my clothing, etc.  How does a wage floor create four wage levels?  If you can't even break even on a job, why would you do it?	20
0	So for you a Trans is anyone who feels like they're someone else?  This us the kind if thought process that the left is shoving down the throats of everyone else.	20
1	"It featured a black girl wearing a blonde wig, several school employees and a number of minority students." I can't stop laughing at this image. If they wanted to teach, they should examine the grammer of online news sites.	20
0	I do agree, but I am just saying it isn't right to say that this is a freedom of speech issue.  Its not anything the 1st amendment is supposed to do anything about.  It definitely violates other laws. I completely agree with that.	20
0	Why should we be worried about people who have stopped looking for work and are living with their parents, watching daytime tv?  The goal of capitalism is to find jobs for people who want them.  If you've given up, we shouldn't be worrying about finding you a job.  If you don't care, the BLS shouldn't care either.  At that point, you're not unemployed, you just don't work.	20
0	actually, 100% of presidential elections the past 60+ years have been decided by black voters. They vote 98% democratic. If they just slightly distributed their votes across party lines (you know, like every other race in America does) then Democrats would have won ZERO elections. Unfortunately, even decades upon decades of the same socio-economic situations isn't enough for black people in Democratic cities to catch on to the fact that Dems have ZERO incentive to better their situation. Somehow it's still the fault of republicans. Not sure how...	20
1	True but I don't think the main goal of the IRA was to evangelize Catholicism	20
1	But it just hasn't been applied properly yet, people!!!!	20
0	What?  That is what you got from my comment?  The debate is about when the fetus is a person and when it is part of a woman's body.	20
1	To be fair, there are three in the top five, now.   With that said, it's amazing that if Bernie was doing this it would be upvoted to oblivion and that since it's ~~Ron~~ Rand, according to the Redditors there it's "Grandstanding".  **EDIT: D'oah.**	20
1	I'm sure part of it was posturing by the left, as you alluded to. But isn't it possible also McCain at the very least emphasized his most conservative views to win the primary?  I was a tad young in 2007 to really know :D	20
0	In Biblical times, marriage was for a census and that's about it. If you mean by "and all my worldly goods" that just means that when two people got married they shared their stuff, legally. It didn't have anything to do with Cesar giving the Jews a tax credit for claiming a spouse.   Tax benefits should be for everyone, they should be flat rates with no special treatment to anyone. That way whether you are married, single, parents, whatever, you enjoy the benefits of living in a society that doesn't overtax you for any reason thus allowing you to enjoy things you spend money on.	20
0	Yep life isn't fair.  Some people are smarter or harder workers than other people and make more money.  Why is it that a person who makes more money should  be forced to pay more for the same public services?  Also, I have yet to hear anyone suggest a 30% flat tax.  Thats ridiculous.  More common is 15%.  And if you make $20,000 a year that $3,000 in taxes (federal), yes there is state or sales tax blah blah blah, we are talking about the federal rate.  I don't find this unreasonable.  I suppose it is even a better incentive to work hard and become rich.	20
1	The KKK was NOT about religion.  They hated all non-WASPs...black, Jewish, Catholic (Italian, Polish, Irish, Hispanic, whatever...), Asian, Native Americans.  It was race/ethnicity that was the motivator, not religion per se.	20
0	&gt; voters really aren't that wrong.  We *maybe* had negative growth in Q1 but, we can't say for sure even though we're a month &amp; a half into Q2.  Following that, we're a month &amp; a half away from receiving the incomplete Q2 numbers &amp; from all this, we're to infer that there's most probably, maybe, a definitive recession?	20
0	I'm pretty sure the rules also make it just as wrong as a student wearing an anti-nra t shirt. Something about keeping the school politics-free, I think.	20
1	Lol what? Do any other countries have an election coming up? Maybe I'll go over there and vote in it.	20
1	Somebody's been reading from Howard Zinn's Great Hits collection.	20
1	Fauxcahontas ain't Brokahontas.	20
1	Totally agree.    I'll never understand why republicans ever expose themselves to people with zero interest in facts, but only the liberal ideology.    While occasionally they can get in some slap downs, whoever controls the interview or debate always has the power to mold the outcome.  Just as you suggest, there should be no questions simply topics and they state their position.	20
0	Ah, moving to where you want is not democratic!  I forgot!  Better stay in my government zoned white person camp!	20
1	inb4 cries about Westboro's protests being just as bad as terrorist attacks.	20
1	Pam Gellar is an American hero. A lot of people talk about the Islam problem but she's brave enough to make herself visible and be proactive about it. Draw Muhammad contests should come to every major city in America so that more anti-Islam voices can be heard. I would be glad to have my tax dollars pay for extra protection to let free speech thrive.	20
0	Yeah lets send in weekend warrior college students to deal with riots. Great fucking idea.	20
1	I truly thought this was an article from the /r/TheOnion.  I mean, seeing as only [71% of Americans can locate the Pacific ocean on a map](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/903062/posts?page=63) &amp; about the same number believe [the Bible is literally true](http://www.gallup.com/poll/148427/say-bible-literally.aspx), I think we can safely assume what many voters *feel* &amp; what's *fact* aren't necessarily directly linked.	20
0	When people face a long train of abuses, they reserve the right to resort to violence (its in the Declaration of Indepence).  Good, law-abiding, successful, educated folks will sometimes dress up in garb and throw the Tea in the Harbor, will they not?	20
0	&gt;Although the system is clearly immature and much development is still to occur (fig 1), good evidence exists that the biological system necessary for pain is intact and functional from around 26 weeks' gestation.  Right, but the article also says when the apparatus to feel pain is complete in most fetuses, at 26 weeks. Either way I definitely agree with the conclusion that fetal pain should not be discussed in regards to abortion counseling.	20
0	We have no idea what, if any trauma the kids are going through now, or may have been going through just prior to their removal.  For all we know the parents are abusers/neglecters/molesters/etc.    Privacy laws are evil, and give cover to government abusers and medical abusers, more than they protect anyone that they claim to be protecting.  Because of the privacy laws, the public will never know the real story here, and that's dangerous, because if there *is* a government abuse of power in this case, the public can't take any effective action to curb it.	20
1	Anyone can be racist. Plus she looks white to me.	20
1	The problem is when you're honest about the things which hold them back, such as welfare dependency, affirmative action, gangsta rap culture, or planned parenthood targeting them for population reduction, you get labeled a racist.	20
1	&gt; But that said  Ah the part when you contradict yourself!	20

Domestic terrorism delivered right to our front doorstep, courtesy Pamela Geller and Co with their little racist cartoon drawing contest.  No thank you.  I will not carry their water for them the way you do.  That path just leads to more violence and less freedom for all.	20
0	Not one full time job, two or more part-time jobs.  And there aren't hour limits to receiving SNAP.  In fact, you have to be working at least 20 hours a week to receive SNAP for more than 3 months in a 3 year period, unless you're disabled.	20
1	That's how the media gets you though, they downplay anything like that or flat out ignore it, hell I didn't learn Staphaluffagus was in the Clinton admin until a few years ago and I'm 24 now. It makes sense considering how much water he carried with the "war on woman" schtick.   Hell, here's a [image showing just how ingrained the media is with the obama admin, you can't get any closer than marriage, wait there are a few siblings in there damn](http://truthorfictioncom.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WHITE-HOUSE-MEDIA1.jpg)	20
1	While there are no plans to close, the article states that if the store cannot achieve a significant increase in revenue, it will be forced to close.  The owner is attempting to increase revenue through creative means before giving up.	20

0	&gt; Given the facts as we know them, police **consciously** didn't do their job properly  Ok mucklick the magnificent mind reader extraordinaire, what am I thinking at this moment ?	20
0	The declaration of independence has zero laws in it. None. Plus, creator is obviously vague on purpose.   The Constitution enumerates our rights, the first amendment going against at least 4 commandments, and there is zero mention of a god on it. None.	20
1	If you don't consider a fetus a person (most libs don't) then abortion and murder are completely different.	20
1	I'm in the same boat as tinteoj. I'm fairly liberal, but don't want Clinton 2.0 just as much as I don't want Bush 3.0.   The only conservative I would happily vote for is Jon Huntsman.	20

0	But your whole argument is void considering God didn't actually command to kill anybody who draws pictures or creates idols. This is not an Islamic belief.   Edit: And besides, Muslims and Christians follow the same God. The whole "different deity" deal is non-existent with Abrahamic religions.	20
1	Leftists are the same all over.	20
1	Typical communist/socialist, the attitude being you should only get what you absolutely **need**.  And their track record sucks tremendously at even just supplying *that*.  What's amazing is that so very many people are so completely shit-stupid as to fall for this kind of rhetoric.	20
0	George W. Bush ran on a non-intervenionist, anti-bank platform. You saw how that turned out... I don't trust socialist filth like Bernie.	20
1	Brilliantly stated. Completely agree. This is what is perpetuating our gridlock and essentially useless congress.	20
1	Police officers are agents of the government. I agree that they have a hard job, but you can't say that they're not part of the government.	20
0	“The problem in Washington is not that politicians agree too little but that they agree too much.  Both parties have worked together to grow government far beyond what we can afford, and what the Founders intended.  Sadly, there is not enough political will in Washington to fix the real problems facing the country.  It’s time for the people to take back their country.  The plan put forth by Convention of States is a great way to do just that by using the process the founders gave us for reigning in the federal government.” Tom Colburn  Quote Source http://www.conventionofstates.com/convention_of_states_gains_momentum_with_sen_tom_coburn_s_support	20
1	He did. Instead of playing ball he showed the reporter how dumb the question was. Are democrats being hounding by reporters asking them "Do you hold animosity against Christians? Do you not support religious freedom?" These are negative gotcha questions that have an automatic answer of "no". But the fact that they are asked is because that wasn't a true journalist but a partisan shill playing identity politics.	20

1	Probably the most irritating thing was attending a mandatory lecture on education from Bill Ayer.  I did like that when I tore apart him apart the next class, the professor agreed that Ayer's speech was pretty pointless.  I also remember discussing politics with the one professor I knew to be conservative, and he described how at department meetings the chair was passing out "Kerry" yard signs to everyone.  He said it was creepy and made him really uncomfortable when he refused the sign.	20
0	Lol, you know what really burns a community to the ground? This attitude of yours.  I don't understand why people flip their shit and go all conspiritard over the simplest of changes. We are 8 months into this shit and people are STILL paranoid about moderation changes?  Well, if you want to develop a mental illness, that's how you do it.	22
0	I don't support the honey badgers, but I support the part of gamergate that's about ethics in game journalism.	22
0	Afraid of what?  Is GG's end goal a world where people are too scared to write "gamers don't have to be your audience", or to give feminist criticism of games?	22
0	&gt; I don't know if it is meant to be a satire   What is there to satirize, though? The way gay people talk? Satire should be about pushing up, not kicking down.  &gt; It's just killing of "innocent people", which is common in so many games that it makes the outrage hypocritical.  Those games don't require you to do that, it is not the main objective. Or those innocents are not actually that innocent.	22
0	yea, im with you on the reaction of anti-gg	22
0	&gt; Anybody want to do a fundraiser for Eron?  Not particularly.  This is a situation where the community needs to cut its loses.  I've donated quite a bit to the HBB fund but I won't drop a penny on Eron because he is not going to win.	22

Weird...  Anyway, you have at least two or three groups and one or two just want to use this platform for their own agenda.  The battles that the gaming community fights are going to change over time from SJWs, to conservatives (Hello Jack Thompson) to politicians to anyone else that decides to induce moral panic.  Some people just can't see outside that war cry they invoke to keep everyone on the offensive.	22

1	&gt; it's ending tonight  Uhhhh, that totally doesn't sound like a \*massive* warning sign *at all*. I know Chu is a complete moron and a loon, but right there he actually sounds like a legit psychopath. Assuming that's not the case, he really needs to rethink how he words his tweets.	22
1	Exactly what happened. Green confided in someone he trusted that he was intentionally baiting them, to keep them focused on Cabal. That guy turned out to be a troll himself, and leaked it (then complained that people were spamming the tag because self awareness is not his strong suit). Some people are blaming Green for that and it kind of baffles me.	22
0	Same here, I never felt as a "gamer", but the way people defined as gamers were treated when GG started was so annoying, that I decided that the side opposing gamers is much worse.	22

0	&gt;These subs aren't a secret you know? The admins and the SRS crowd all know about them. The only reason they don't ban them in general backlash from the greater community.

0	No, a conflict of interest = have an interest which COULD bias you.    Conflicts of interest can be actual, potential, or apparent.  An apparent conflict of interest is when there is not actually a conflict, but to a reasonable 3rd party it could appear that there is a conflict.  Those still have to be disclosed!   I've spent a significant amount of time managing conflicts of interest in a professional setting.	22

0	Also the author can't even bring himself to spell faggot.	22
1	No, that doesn't even begin to describe this article. The "news" piece contradicts itself in the same fucking paragraph. First it says that "Local 16" Sommers was a bar patron, then it implies she is the bar owner. This guy couldn't even keep his narrative straight for a paragraph. I could understand if the author just copy pasted the article from Kotaku, but apparently they couldn't even do that correctly.	22
0	y'all killing me. keep talking about OMG THE SALT! and saying oh, ghazi must lurk here! but y'all are doing all the same shit. do you have any self awareness at all? like, a scrap?	22
0	It's impossible to lose. We have, you know, actual truth, honesty and facts and shit on our side. Our opposition is ravenously cannibalistic to their own, destructive liars and all-around crap people.	22
0	People sit at their computers, typing the opposite, in a country founded on people who considered it a legitimate strategy. And are only allowed to speak their minds with that kind of freedom because their ancestors disagreed with them.  They have a right to be stupid, but they should be a little more aware.	22
1	Fuck that. He deserve to have his nose rubbed in his own hypocritical shit.	22
0	You guys make merit badges for breaking them	22
1	Clearly you haven't seen how just how widespread SJWs have gotten. I live on the opposite side of the country, and I've met several. In real life.	22
0	Well, it's back now.  Fuck, I was going to screenshot it.	22
1	&gt; I'm for social justice  What is "social justice"?  It seems to mean "equality," which *inevitably* encounters the fact that equality of opportunity produces inequality of results, which then necessitates lowering the higher to raise the lower, or the entire system must confront the fact that it is based on paradox.	22
0	Jesus fucking christ IGN. That's god damn embarrassing. Get your shit together.	22
0	No, just use it as citations when necessary.	22
0	&gt; Oh glorious, look at the Partners on the bottom. DFB. German Olympic Bund. Die Zeit... shows you how accepted far-left radicals are.  *Netz gegen ~~Rechts~~ Nazis* is far-left radical? Is the *Verfassungsschutz* far-left radical, too? They don't like the extreme right or neo Nazism either. Do you think that Anti-Nazism is generally an extreme or far-left position?  Don't be ridiculous.	22
0	Pretty sure the /pol/tards took over a long, long time ago. I genuinely think that substantial ethical issues wouldn't even make the radar for a lot of people if the journalist in question couldn't be identified as a "Cultural Marxist" by the Cultural Marxism experts at /pol/.	22

1	gotta make that 10bux count for something.	22
1	To be fair it was credible enough that the police came in strong force and the place was evacuated.   The other point is true though. Good journalism would only attribute it to a group if there is some verifiable incation to do so.	22
0	Let's be jerks to the guy who holds dissenting views and has accepted to be interviewed in order to explain his opinions.  You can be jerks if you want after the interview but what is the point of being outraged now, you're just wasting the time Netscape9 put into this.	22
1	Yeah, I don't think Chu has the balls to make a bomb threat either. But the police really do need to speak to him right now.  EDIT: Actually after seeing [this](https://twitter.com/Scrumpmonkey/status/594253463036567554) maybe he was involved somehow...	22
0	&gt; Most liberal folks DID believe people who said they were traumatized, offended, threatened, assaulted, etc.  This is an incredibly idiotic statement.	22
0	&gt; so you have to understand that not everybody who opens their mouth will know everything  Then don't open your fucking mouth, retard.  Wow.   How hard is that to do?   The idiocy in your mentality is incredibly fucking apparent, now.	22
1	&gt; Anti-GG in so much as how they can use it as a vehicle for their politics, supporting their friends and condemning their enemies.  Generally I agree but there are legit aGGro's who are Gamers; I think *they* are really under-estimating the threat to Gaming.	22
0	The core conflict is still Ukrainian vs Ukrainian. But that's way off topic at this point.	22
0	You've said plenty enough about how you make really bad arguments premised on nothing more than your assumptions and scapegoat economics.  I'm kind of bored now, because pointing to Adrian ignores what's gone on in those countries and even the words of some of the people who want a more state regulated economy.  All you're doing is premising your entire argument on one person as a representative of the whole, the same crap that feminists do.  Ugh...	22
1	...And who is PixelGoth?	22
1	I agree that this is off topic but many other subreddits have voted off topic pictures and articles simply for being true. Also insulting people that are skeptic to the extraordinary belief that sexism is institutionalized in STEM doesn't make you correct. I could say that one could be "literally autistic" to not see that science departments and orginaztions around the world are censoring any discussion about intelligent design, doesn't mean I'm correct.	22
1	we're already ISIS, the KKK, and Nazis, so I guess it wouldn't be that much of a stretch.	22
0	Shush. We are trying to get angry over nothing here.	22
1	This is fucking hilarious.  How fucking *stupid* do you even have to be.	22
0	Isn't Oliver Campbell the guy who led the censorship campaign to take racist elements out of the Stanley parable?	22
1	Not surprised at all. GG will probably be blamed for this one just as we were blamed when someone from anti GG talked about using sarin gas to kill GG supporters at a convention.	22
0	And all these threats have been written by overweight pigs who start to breath heavily after climbing three steps. I bet, after they beat Joss's ass, they go run the iron man and then beat Federer in Wimbledon.	22

1	But before that he was trying to get the venue to not allow the meeting. "It ends tonight" is the tail-end of what he's been spewing on the topic.	22
1	&gt; The correct answer is not to speculate who did it at all and let the authorities do their job.  Yup. Very sensible. I should have gone with that.	22
0	If both sides are country men of said nation, its a civil war. Both sides may have assistance of some form or another, but at the end of the day, if the sides are both Ukrainian, that reside in the same nation, that is not an invasion. Unless you accept US Intel at face value, in which case, there are WMDs in Iraq.	22
1	If the bomb threat Anita got was "fake", then why do you immediately believe the one #GGinDC got was real? We've been parroting that internet threats are not real, and giving Anita/ZQ/Wu/Etc shit for it. Let's not pull their "WE WERE HARASSED!" card.   With that said, it's still super shitty and the fact that nobody in the media wants to report it just proves the media bias.	22
0	With all due respect, it's irrelevant what your experience with a certain phrase is.   I mean, do we suddenly change the meaning of entitlement and what not because sjw's keep using it incorrectly?  Ironically what you're doing is the same thing you're criticizing. By claiming that said term is solely used incorrectly, you're implying that there's no case in which Islamophobia really exist which means you're dismissing real people who really suffer from others acting out of Islamophobia. Just because your specific experience is that the term is used incorrectly.	22
0	Is it?  I just... I really don't care.	22
0	So just the tweets you agree with then?	22
0	Give him the same treatment he gave us. If there are two ways to take something he said, pick the worst one, then sensationalise it.  "ZOMG king SJW just admitted to wanting to kill GG members!!!11oneeleven"	22
1	Better question: why won't the media report on threats thrown our way the same as they do for those that go the other way?  Edit: Yes, I know the answer. It's just a better question to ask said media and people outside of this situation, and should be done so at every opportunity.	22
1	I took that as a joke, but you're completely right. https://twitter.com/xambercoalx  Edit: She (?) says it was a joke after all parodying SJWs: https://twitter.com/xAmberCoalx/status/594143539316928513	22
0	Yes, but for speaking against the government or failing to do your job properly or something. This is just for wanting a pretty slut to make the workplace tolerable.	22
1	I almost had a conversation with him, but he found out I supported GG and shut down completely  then proceeded to tell anyone else trying to talk to me in the same thread that they shouldn't bother because I was GG and my opinions wouldn't change.  He seems super great	22

0	&gt; That's the problem, it's not an "opinion"--the wage gap has even be debunked by feminists. It's literally a myth that is just being supported through political pundancy, star power and journalists. (Hence the relevancy).    The problem is that people think this has something to do with Gamergate, which it does not I quote what it says on the right:   &gt; KotakuInAction is the place to discuss the gaming community, gaming journalism, and issues in the gaming industry.

0	I listen to NPR regularly. I've never heard them (especially not Shankar) talk about purposefully lying. I *will* say that they sometimes include a bit of spin that seems unnecessary. Their op ed stories are often very liberal (no surprise).   However, they disclose a *ton*. They're constantly saying when there's a potential conflict of interest. They're also the only news radio I've seen that consistently talks about responses they've gotten about past stories they ran (good or bad).	22

0	Ditto. Keep all this MRA shit out of the sub.	22
0	That makes no sense.  Liberal policies work to hollow out the inner cities and communities and yes, there's the Progressive Caucus which is all about reforms to the current economic system, but liberalism's contradictions come from how it's born of capitalism and ignores its systemic dysfunction.  Sure, you can call them neoliberal, but you can't deny them as being liberal at all, especially when the main argument for other groups (conservatives mainly) is to conflate them as a form of Marxist which is far more off base than calling them liberals.	22
1	&gt; Not using Kasual  One job...you had one job.	22
0	That's my entire point. They claim that GamerGate supports them when that's impossible. They shouldn't do that.  So am I missing something here? People seem to have disliked what I said, but liked what you said, though all you did was rephrase what I said (and added that you, personally, like them).	22

1	Meh for being Kotaku it's actually fair though you can sense the butthurt in every word, how there's doubt in any sentence while a bomb threat to Anita that didn't even include the words gamers, game or GamerGate, was still GG's fault, and it was gospel	22
1	Oh wow. She decided to use the funds to donate to Feminist Frequency run by Anita Sarkeesian, another person who failed to fulfill their KickStarter requirements.	22

You do not march into a school and demand that they entertain your arguments in favor of pedophilia.    The  fact that you think arguments are won, or rightness determined,  by how many accounts have-however temporarily-attended to your sub-Reddit is just icing on the cake of your  miss understanding of the situation .	22

0	I used to use it years ago. It used to be necessary back then, because many ads could lead to either one million popups or even worse a virus. But nowadays, I don't care anymore. The creators of websites deserve the 0.00000000000001$ they get with every click.	22
1	Seriously though, anti-ggers are kind of crazy.	22
0	Feminism, today, is third-wave feminism, which is the woman-focused, non-intersectional component of SJW ideology. Some would even argue that they're synonymous.  Feminism in the way that you think of it, first-wave, is a historical footnote. To the extent that it exists today, it lives on in its spiritual successor of egalitarianism.  TL;DR: #HowToSpotAFeminist is synonymous with #HowtoSpotASocialJusticeWarrior.	22
1	To be honest i really didn't. Everything was going fine. I saw the bomb threat get posted but i laughed it off as a troll. Then bam police arrive. Well at least this breaks their narrative to pieces lol.  &gt;Get called terrorists  &gt;Get bomb threat made against us	22

But weren't those fags going outside Scientology places holding signs and wearing Guy Fawkes masks? Others were complaining about how GG should stay anonymous. My argument back was that some of don't have a fear of loosing our jobs and have the freedom to meet publicly without fear of reprisal.	22
1	I'd say "apparent" in the title is the first major tell.	22
0	I think this would be a great step in removing some of the clutter from the front page.	22
0	This is awesome.  However, I want to stress one thing. GG can never be "over". It's more than what it started as. We aren't just a consumer revolt anymore. We're an industry watchdog. We have a job to do in making sure that games journalists remain ethical for time to come. That is our job.  But, for the time being, congrats.	22

0	How exactly is it limiting ourselves when we can all get our general SJW nonsense news at TiA, or in the affiliate subs TorInAction (spec-fic and Hugo's) or WerthamInAction (comics)?  ProteinWorld, NUS bigotry, UVA rape stories, and the Baltimore City Paper fiasco have nothing to do with gaming. I saw posts on all of those things in TiA, so the idea that people won't get exposed to it if it's not hosted here is a little odd.	22
1	There's nothing wrong with colored hair. But you know why they do it, don't you? It's because they don't want to be white.	22

1	I certainly think it was trolls wanting a laugh, but I also doubt it would have happened if Chu hadn't kicked up such a fuss. His efforts to stop the meet happening was just asking for trolls to act	22

0	Those personalities and their drama is at least tangentially related to GG, because they are "GG personalities".  ProteinWorld, NUS bigotry, UVA rape stories, and the Baltimore City Paper fiasco have nothing to do with gaming. I saw posts on all of those things in TiA, so the idea that people won't get exposed to it if it's not hosted here is a little odd.	22
1	Well, I'm sure we could think of some hilarious scenarios, but in all honesty, if I had to *really* strive to be accurate in my prediction, I believe the average comment would look like this:  "I think this is terrible what happened but now we see what a hate movement brings about itself. Still very tragic."  OR  "I feel very sorry for the victims but this is just more proof of toxic masculinity and how the patriarchy ends up hurting us all."	22

1	Because WP rules mean literally nothing.   Reliable Source is just a way to selectively enforce and delete content people disagree with.   There is also technically a requirement for an Neutral Point Of View (NPOV) which states that sources should present both sides to controversies.  They *never* do that.	22
1	Reporting isn't supposed to "convince" people of anything; it's supposed to present people with information and let them form opinions for themselves. The idea that a social justice agenda can be best served by the media creating a narrative was the point of my posting this article.	22
1	&gt; Had there been any legitimate threats to Anita, you can be damn sure police would have done something.  The bomb threat to the college she was speaking at has been talked about numerous times. It's been released to the public. The police and the FBI did say it was not credible.  It, however, was not fake. It happened and there's proof of it all over the internet.	22
1	Yeah I like Pakman and part of that reason is his obvious great preparation for interviews. But don't tell me you're uninformed of this.	22
0	That's good though. /r/history always has some asshats that always bring up their political inclination in just about every post they make. Either SJWs or stormweenies, these people always relent. They would be banned manually, anyway.   And these aren't exactly politically ambivalent terms, these are pretty concise buzzwords both parties abuse constantly. So what's the problem?	22
1	Because we aren't developmentally stunted socially and emotionally. We fix our shit instead of creating imaginary bogeymen and blaming others for it.	22
1	I can't stand the word "Islamophobia". It's used as a cheap way of trying to shut down conversation.	22
0	Because it's an easy target, rather than accepting issues might be more complex.	22
0	lol, this false equivalence is ridiculous. There are loads of evidence of feminsts trying to get them kicked out from the bar. No one was trying to get kicked out Anita from the University when she had there her speech before the bomb threat. You are giving them free pass while letting them shit on us. This is just stupid.	22
1	That is a great point. having money in a mutual fund that changes stocks is NOT the same as directly donating money to a patreon or a kickstarter. Pakman is full of shit at this point. All he cares about is the clicks.    Look at Kluweless' interview, so softball. No hard questions, but he fought against Sargon on the clickbait shit for like 10 minutes.	22

0	Here we go again. I think I need to make a form letter or something. I had just joined reedit like 2 days ago. I didn't know how things work. I'm sorry. For fuck's sake. You never made any mistakes as a new user? You know that. I've told you so how many times now?	22
1	I was there. The owner of the bar came by about 20 minutes into the event to chat with some of us. He talked about receiving hundreds of phone calls and emails, and spoke about threats.  When I clarified with him about the threats, on whether we posed a threat to him, or whether it was they who threatened him, he replied it was the latter.  And oh, his response to the whole thing?   "This is America. Anyone can come to my bar."  For fucks sake, I come from Singapore and I know exactly what authoritarianism looks like. This bullshit has authoritarian fury written all over it.	22
0	To limit the shift to sjw in action we could simply post stickies, say megathreads for topics which are off topic, such as protein worl and linking back to TiA or SJWiA.	22
1	Someone should contact DC PD and notify them of Chu and that anon's threatening tweets preceding the SWAT/Fire Alarm.	22
0	Just ANSWER THE QUESTION.   Edit: honestly GG as a loud proponent on twitter, this would be it for me. I don't want to be called a slut. I won't go to the other side, but i'm super disappointed.	22
0	" shifts away from making games that gamers will enjoy to one which satisfies criteria just to avoid being hurt by accusations of bigotry."  You are still differentiating between gamers and those who might be concerned about a game's possible bigotry. That is the problem. Those are not separate categories.   One of the grand lies of GG has been the demand for games (or reviews) which are apolitical.   That hasn't been possible since Pong.	22
0	I consider my post neutral. I don't consider it fair that you consider it hostile.	22
1	To clear up any misunderstanding, that pic is *not* from a ghazi meeting. Apparently the EXIF info shows that it occurred long before Gamergate. I know it may have been meant as a joke but some people do believe it's based on reality, so, no, it's NOT.	22
1	He just described the radfem movement perfectly.  I'm literally never reading RPS again.	22
0	I don't see anything about Social Justice, anything to do with feminism, etc... in the comic.	22
0	Credit where credit is due: he nailed it.	22
0	Oh man you got me! However I'm not rallying against supposed injustices of people like you and calling you neckbeards (unless of course the conversation warrants insults). I'm asking you legitimate questions because I never have seen "SJW" properly defined. Ever. I'm asking question because you have evaded the burden of proof for your claims.  But yeah, /r/justneckbeard things is a circlejerk fun forum. This forum however is not a circlejerk'y fun forum. You people are actually serious when you say "SJW".	22
1	&gt; hahaha when you search "gamergate bomb threat" almost every result is bomb threats SENT by gamergate   Yeah. There's 0 evidence that has ever happened. Perhaps that's the entire point of GG isn't it? It's so obvious and yet these morons don't get it. If it's on the internet and written by one of their SJW buddies, they believe it no matter what it says.  Even if it said that Hitler was actually a good guy and his goals were excellent, and he had a good idea with exterminating millions of people.  They're just so incapable of independent thought that it's scary, quite frankly.	22
1	I don't know about that but there is a growing trend of female teachers raping young boys.	22
0	If person A takes a pile of silicon and copper and mashes it into a ball, and person B takes an identical pile of silicon and copper and forges it into a smart phone, then person B ends up being wealthier than person A, EVEN GIVEN THE EXACT SAME RESOURCES.  Wealth isn't simply a measure of physical matter.	22
0	Good luck with your muh freedoms kickstarter	22
0	Sorry, is it blase to point out TB being a hypocrite by now or is this sub just slowly turning into Ghazi? Because I don't think I've seen anybody trying to argue TB's behavior here is *defensible*, it seems like I'm just getting downvoted because I have something bad to say about somebody's favorite eceleb.	22
0	Dude, there is no way that the "it" is about the praise in the context of the comment he/she replied to. It would make no logical sense	22
0	Isn't this another example of him criticizing SJWs in the past few weeks. Outside of him putting in that effort to shut down the GG meetup and make sure "it ends tonight" he seems to be coming to his senses a bit.	22
1	The isolated crazies of twitter might just be unstable enough to do something crazy, but it's not very likely. Nothing happened in London, so I think it'll be ok.	22
1	Why are celebrities getting involved in this?	22
1	They never listen to you when you tell them.	22
1	My advice. Just make it an epic group barhop. Let's see them bomb threat all of downtown.	22
0	An individual I trust got a media badge and saw the game behind the scenes. He plans on purchasing it day one. I say too many people are guessing on a November release. We will learn more at EA presser at E3.	22
1	&gt; Honestly, I don't think anti-GG is stupid enough to do this.  I think they absolutely are. But I won't believe they did without some proof, because it could just as equally be the work of trolls as you mention.	22
1	And they say we're gender-discriminatory!	22
1	&gt; "What has been called by many the Westboro Baptist Church of gaming communities..."  * WBC (brand new) * ISIS **x2** * Nazis * Anonymous * Illuminati * KKK * ~~The reason for the Ebola spread~~ Literally **EBOLA!** * Sockpuppets * Misogynistic * Transphobic * Right-wing nutjobs  Who else are we by this point? For the love of Based Mom...  **EDIT:** How could I've forgotten the Klan...^no^ban^pls  EDIT2: More identites	22
1	Oh, I didn't realize Anita and her friends were invited to the meetup! /s	22
1	100% metal issues. Some percentage of that is trolling, but that's not the issue.	22
1	Oh, shove off Quinn, we don't care who you're related to.	22
1	&gt;My first interview will be with Trigonometry  What's the angle for the interview? I hear he is often right, but can be obtuse. Just watch you don't go off on tangents.  SOHCAHTOA forever!	22
1	"Can we stop posting videos of shitheels acting like normal people!! TRIGGERED!"	22
0	just for lolz we should send Razor!	22
1	&gt; Is there a possibility that it's a shared account?  Ryu and Long. [Double Dragon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9escFiqUJ0U)	22
1	He totally threw that in to make the radicals angry.	22
1	I think we may need to add "stolen hearts" next to bomb threat on the list of crimes that have taken place tonight.	22
1	"I downloaded a movie. *WITHOUT PAYING!*"	22
1	If we're sharing things involving Joss Whedon being a hypocrite...then [here](https://youtu.be/57tXyqPCOCM?t=1s) is Thunderf00t with the BTFO.	22
1	Chu is a jackass that openly condones attacks against us. I'm all for poking him whenever he opens his dumb mouth.	22
0	How is that going to happen when half of the web is convinced that we hate women in general? Most people don't even know what we did for TYFC.	22
0	Hate to be that guy, but you can't expect people to have any attitude or mindset. People are who people are. But since this has been such a bumpy ride for you, I'm sure you're happy to see it moving along without you.   I appreciate what you've done in hosting the work of so many of us, but now the buck is passing, and you can focus on your other projects like Vidya.fm (really dig it btw, always down for some vidya tunes).	22
0	Are you a woman? If not, why do you care? If so, why don't you accept trans people as women?	22
0	So cheating? By any normal definition of sexual abuse, you're using the term inaccurately. What you describe can in no way be considered sexual abuse and you honestly can't be surprised when a heavily moderated forum will sanction you for such misrepresentation.   Why not just call it cheating? Sexual abuse is a crime and you're accussing someone of committing that crime wrongfully.	22
1	I've already expressed interest on twitter, but I'll throw my interest in here too.  I'll dig around on twitter and see if I can find some Sydney GamerGate people and let them know.	22
0	Yeah, there are still minor things to nitpick. But overall they did correct most of it.	22
1	Wouldn't really surprise me. They're stalking this topic as it is and posting comments on twitter and showing how much they don't care about GG and ColorCabal	22
1	welcome to the new age of political censorship.	22
0	and in germany, you have freedom of speech and yet are not allowed to proliferate naziism or nazi regalia... and they're doing fine.  imo, there's definitely a middle ground here... a RIGHT way to ban that which is genuinely detrimental and harmful and evil....  but for fuck's sake, it always seems like the people who are making up the rules err on the side of idiocy.... **I** would be able to make the right call. i'm sure of it. it **CAN** be done well and badly... and unfortunately for us, most of the time, it gets done badly.	22
0	Let anyone join. If we don't, they will literally be trapped in Anti-Gamergate. Can you imagine a greater coup against the gaming media than Brianna Wu going neutral or supporting GG?  Which is why it will never happen. They will literally destroy her if she does.   So I say: don't make it difficult for people who broadly share our goals to join. There is literally no downside to it. Can you imagine the cheering on GamerGhazi if some of our figures they despise most were to defect?	22
1	honestly I was expecting the BMI to be higher.	22
1	archive the archive!!! The internet never forgets.	22
1	It's a parody of a scene from the GamerGate-related Law and Order SVU episode.	22
0	He's a good debater but this is one where we exchange ideas with someone willing to improve the actual ethics, it's not a dumbass sjw where we talk about what GamerGate is and isn't, there Milo's sass is perfect. That said I haven't seen how he fares in an exchange of ideas with someone intelligent where he doesn't need to drop the D on his opponent	22
1	That shits called maturity right there.  You can get outraged of life's problems or you can just get more resolved to fix them.	22
1	The power she wields she can be both a legit academic who is invited to speak at universities and drop some dank memez after.	22
1	Don't attribute the bomb threat to a group without proof. And don't claim the threats were credible because, well, the venue is still standing. This is a silly accusation.	22
1	I wish Sargon had jumped on that instance of pacman looking for a confirmation to begin talking about the clickbaity titles - if he hadn't specified once more that it was an analogy, you bet that David would've squeezed that in the title. The result would have probably been something as self aware as "Sargon of akkad compares GG to world war 1,  believes these titles are clickbait"	22
1	The Chu is on the other foot I see...	22
0	This isn't racism. It's hypocritical, yes, because it's racist according to their own inane standards so by all means call them out and rub their noses in it.  But don't let them win by adopting their standards just to prove a point.  It's not racist.	22
1	That's simple. They won't be satisfied until we're rejected everywhere and shunned by everyone. All of this based on opinions they think I hold regarding peoples gender, race, and sexual preference. Instead of fighting actual misogynists, racists, and homophobes/transphobes the disingenuous assholes just declare a group is and go after them. Slacktivism at it's finest.   All of this because I wanted to know if critic recommendations were legitimate or if a conflict of interest led them to their conclusion. I'm so evil.	22
1	Regardless of what anyone thinks anyone is "owed"(which they are), if your a large company and you just randomly decide not to finish early access games you said you would finish, well, no more money for them. Therefore their deservedly shit reputation.	22
1	There's something that feels quite good about this video.  Before, videos of Gamergate supporters contain individuals, who discuss with people over the internet, "silently".  Even discussions that are not video/audio-based are just words we read on the internet.  This video has people cheering/applauding, in person, over things that are common opinion/jokes of Gamergate.  Probably the first of its kind that I've seen since Gamergate started.  It's the feeling that you truly are not alone.	22
1	John Walker's Email Responses^TM : Powered by D-Grade Snark.	22
0	Yeah, that's why he quit, stupid fuck. And what's "load up twitter" anyway, grandpa?	22
1	Thanks for the info.	22
1	lol Discord_Dancing what a piece of shit	22
1	You are not the only one....  I got temp banned when I stated that Zoe shouldn't be giving a top 10 in 2013 just because she was a victim, she should have earned her right (i.e. develop a good game).  when I questioned the temp ban with the mods I got Permna-banned and they called me a dick  I used to be a premium member too	22
1	Yeah, because [sexualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNoXIhKTLw&amp;hd=1)[ has no place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIZhBUXNwzw&amp;hd=1) [in GhostBusters.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVcOc1koj58&amp;hd=1) /s  Yet more proof these authoritarians know **jack all** when it comes to the source material of the media they attack.	22
0	Journalism. Ethics. Ideology. Hypocrisy.	22
1	&gt;Any plans on coming back to 4chan?  My sides, 8ch/v/ has assumed control.	22
0	Self-obsessed? Pretty sure GamerGate is obsessed with other people if anything. And isn't PZ Meyers the guy who called himself 'intellectual artillery' or some such bullshit?  So yeah, I'll give the 10 one way mirrors out of 10.	22
1	Props to him for reporting that. I didn't expect he would go into who or how many attended.	22
0	Indeed. It's a sure bet that GG will use his public email address to make his life as miserable as possible. It's a little surprising for KiA to admit this so openly because I thought you were still trying to maintain some kind of thin anti-harassment facade.	22
0	&gt;They are a logical contradiction in terms. You're uneducated on the topic, apparently. You're too illiterate and lack the education to grasp how "freedom" and "oppression" are in contradiction with one another.  Again, you literally have read a textbook, but don't understand how things actually function.   Do you understand the idea that actions have unintended consequences?	22
0	That's nice. You'd still probably die pretty damn quick, bro.	22
0	That said, they do have a point: The Avengers have plenty of female members, it was the choice of Joss' writers and Joss himself to only have women with mind-magic feature in them.   I wouldn't criticize Scarlet for that, as stated, that's simply her canon character, but it would be a valid complaint of heroine selection to Joss' clearly misogynistic ideals if you were basing merit on physical strength and note the lack thereof in the feminine side of the Avengers, you know, as most do.	22
0	I'm glad you said it. This sub likes to feel validated in their "bias" just  as much as the other one. By bias I mean the conception that antigg sjws are all lunatics.	22
0	Regardless whedon has gone to shit after his buffy/angel tv series ended	22
0	He's an idiot.  But he's a equal opportunity idiot.	22
1	"It may be fake but it raises awareness about a real issue!"	22
0	She sounds a little like Philip Rearden.	22
0	I've only played the first act. But I'd say "pretty good" is a fair description of Act 1. Not bad, not great.	22
0	Well, he is Swedish. He's genetically predisposed to caving in to feminists.	22
0	How about he was adopted but their parents haven't told him yet. Vivan knows though, and it tears her up that their parents forced her not to reveal this to him. The guilt of this inevitable revelation eats away at her and causes a subconscious distance between the siblings.	22
1	Sargon made himself a script in his mind what he would talk about and didn't allow Pakman to derail.  Part of that script was keeping anti-feminism and GamerGate apart. Very smart to keep to the 3 big Cs there cause it doesn't allow Pakman to twist it.  The Eron parts and the Zoe doxxed people caught Pakman of guard. He scored big points there. Pakman's only defense was "I'm uninformed".  And the soundbite he wanted for the title about Binder, he didn't even got that. Pakman lost that round.	22
0	No, not at all, that was a specific reply and would make no sense in reply to the larger discussion because that hadn't even been brought up in that thread, we were pretty clearly discussing the story	22
1	Yeah I remember, RPS was pretty much at the centre of it. It was during the short period of radio silence when I was expecting them to go "Shit, we've looked at this and we can see how it might look to you guys, let's all chill out, we'll add disclaimers where appropriate, and things can get back to normal."  Then... all the gamers died.	22
1	&gt;Stop harassing me after I harassed Notch.	22
0	There's a call for a show of interest in an Orlando meet up. Contact @OrganicAnomaly via Twitter.	22
1	The moment I get a sense that a majority of gamergate is unwelcome to fence sitting is the moment I will join you there.  But to see comments on kotaku where some people write that bomb threats arean acceptable strategy and that these comments were approved shows that there IS support of harassment in anti-gg.  Anyways keep doing your thing boogie and thanks for some of the good content you've provided throughout the years. Many laughs were had.	22
0	The community can also decide that they want things to work differently. That's why we're having a discussion. We're not laying out new terms that you have to adhere to. You're being a bit dramatic.	22
1	HOLY SHIT SARGON HAS A FACE	22
1	&gt; Twitter user Arthur Chu was among the people found **allegedly** harassing the bar patron, Christina Sommers, who goes by the handle Local 16 and **allegedly** supports GamerGate. They had spent much of the day hounding her with questions about whether she knew she was hosting an **alleged** hate group that night.  I think I've just discovered my trigger. Everything, in that paragraph, is either based on hearsay, or laughably incorrect.	22
0	It's surprisingly simple and easy compared to the engineering and art aspects though.	22
1	Arthur Chu: CRITICIZING WOMEN FOR BEING LEGITIMATELY SHITTY JOURNALISTS ON YOUR OWN BLOG IS HARASSMENT, WAAAAAAAAAAAH.  What a chucklehead. How does that man not poke himself in the eye with a fork every time he eats?	22
0	Yeah, he was annoyed and as much as I don't like his philosophy, probably rightly so. The original request really seems rude and out of place to me. Looks like a passive aggressive way of saying - I don't like that content you're writing.	22
1	I think they're a good chance it was just some troll, but there's an equally good chance it was someone with pink hair who thinks they're fighting the "good fight."  I hope we find out which.	22
1	[We are the IRL stonecutters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OExykL5QnXY)	22
0	A simple cult recruiting tactic is to swarm individuals with your viewpoint. People want to naturally fit in,  so if there is a huge vocal movement saying you're wrong, most people tend to believe it.   Edit: source so you know I'm not just on the lol sjw cult bandwagon. I was a jw for years. Part of our recruitment was to travel in pairs because it's easier to pressure your view that way	22

1	Wow what the fuck! How is this shit legal?	22
1	Great. Maybe we can discuss gender inequality in homelessness.	22
1	One of the funniest series ever made. An absolute classic.	22
0	What unethical things do you have her actually doing here?  Writing an opinion piece that hurt your feelings, and a tweet that mocks your "ethics" crusade.  That's it.	22
0	Are there any meetup managers that are government affiliated? I mean, you CAN'T stop the KKK from speaking since the government can't infringe your rights.	22
0	So funny when you guys do that.  Like I'm going to steal to show how bad stealing is!  To point out how gross eating shit is I'm making a shit sandwich!	22
0	Sure but there are plenty of lawyers out there that take free speech cases for free.   From the last thread the OP admitted to being rejected by them, even Popehat couldn't find anybody for him or didn't get back with him.   Which leads me to suspect that his case might not be as strong as he thinks it is.	22
1	If the kickstarter was for the dev kits, then Oculus has also delivered.	22
1	Yay, yet another person I get to loose respect for.  Seriously: http://i.imgur.com/NMS5JMd.png  It's 2015, stop making excuses for people's inability to use Google. I don't care how beloved they are.	22
1	&gt; She looks great so I think it's an honest mistake :P  Absolutely. I actually had to double take when I found out haha	22
0	No, people understand that today's feminism is third-wave and overwhelmingly want to have nothing to do with it. Anyone who's still with it knows they're part of a hate movement. The equivocation argument is disingenuous.	22
1	Because it would hurt their narrative.  "GamerGate meetup received bomb threats to venue. Arthur Chu under suspicion."  See how weird that sounds for anti-GamerGate?  Edit: Obvious question has an obvious answer. It is indeed a question that should be asked in the context it was given.	22
1	They're trolls.  Sometimes funny, sometimes cross the line into being genuinely nasty.  Pretty much the second coming of /b/.	22
0	&gt; McIntosh is the one who was ripping on Whedon, not Anita. Not that there is much of a difference there.  There's a pretty big difference though. For once they're not even the same person, ya know. Maybe you forgot about that part.	22
0	Any time you feel bad about something Mr. Shitface says or does, just take a look at the sales figures for any of his current games and then compare it to Postal 2, a game where you can beat Schafer to death with a rusty shovel as he runs away screaming. Then decide whether to laugh your ass off or feel pity.	22
1	Its almost like people are really different from each other and like we have different chemistry and wants/needs out of life.	22
0	&gt; Did you ignore this because it threw you out?  Nope, calling you out on your bullshit. You can't answer any questions or back up any of your claims. You're merely backpedaling and incompetent of supporting your own statements - stop deflecting with questions. Prove yourself. Until you support a single one of your claims, you have no point, no evidence, nor any education or clue what you're talking about.	22
0	No need for the multiple threads about Whedon, there is one already. Just add new info to that.  http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/34ulmc/off_topic_humor_sjws_turn_on_whedon_whedon_blocks/	22
0	He's right, Sommers and Milo weren't really interested in gaming before this.  He's also right, it directly benefits GG to have something happen which means that there is the chance of a false flag. Kinda like the false flags many, many folks here have accused anti-GG of planting.	22
1	The fact that Batman doesn't just kill Joker is his biggest weakness.	22
0	Your presumed moral highground after using the phrase "genital mutilation" for opt-in reassignment surgery is delicious to me.	22
0	not about appreciation. it's attitudes.	22
0	Only when they censor something that you're not offended by, right?	22
0	If that's true, then GG has been compromised right from the very beginning by third parties that have no interest in video games or journalism reform.	22
0	I lurk AND post because y'all are funny as hell.	22
1	Like the singer of smashing pumpkins Billy Corgan? Wut?	22
0	Everyone. SJW is slang. You won't find slang in anything you'd consider an objective source, certainly not until it's well-established. But this is what it means, this is the objective source you were asking for, and the one you promised to concede to upon delivery.  We're done.	22
0	Agreed. Too much off-topic and TiA shit keeps popping up here. I love TiA, as do probably many here, but that doesn't mean we should turn into TiA ourselves. Maybe mods can link TiA in the sidebar? But then again, KiAChatroom is linked yet people still post off-topic shit in here. Maybe mods should just come down harder on off-topic posts.	22
0	Liberalism is a mental disorder.	22
1	Yes, it was just purely coincidence. It's not like our biggest opponent reads our posts so they'd know exactly where and when we'd have meetups. That's crazy talk, you should get a job and stop being such a crazy glue sniffer!	22

1	There are legitimate problems with some of Nintndo's business practices and their decisions have been hit&amp;miss.   I think one specific reason why parts of the games media might have developed a negative bias against Nintendo is N's decision  to reach out to their audience directly via Nintendo direct. Now this direct engagement also manifested in restrictions on youtubers. The larger point though is that Nintendo somewhat disengaged with its reliance on the media and the media in parts reacted negatively.  Edit: a word (thx autocorrect)	22
0	No, he gets an A+ from those who define "journalistic ethics" as beating back anything not left-wing.	22
1	That's an easy target. What happened to the ghostbusters khaki uniform?   Also a ghostbusters mobile game? Shame on you capcom.	22
1	"Neo-Nazi groups, Scientology or the Westboro Baptist Church"  Wow what examples you've chosen. Has the treatment you got as a GGer taught you nothing? I guess I'm done responding to you.	22
0	I don't attack people I just let them destroy themselves with their own words (Or at least try to avoid) because if I were to try talking to an SJW for example I would be talking to a brick wall, I defend both moral right &amp; wrong content in art I despise censorship &amp; I try my best to find reasonable voices (I only alienate myself from hypocrites or horrible people) like yourself because I don't have the us. vs. them mentality all the time (Even the nicest person can take it too far if they're pushed enough by bullies)	22

0	Holy crap this is actually kind of scary	22
1	I have long suspected that indie games from outside the US get far, far less attention than they deserve.	22

1	They're the most immature people I've ever seen, they all need to have their title of "adult" stripped.  I can't imagine being so self-important that I start bombarding an unsuspecting bar trying to get people kicked out just because people I don't like the people who are going to be there.  Edit: And if anything does happen to anyone tonight Arthur Chu should be held 100% responsible because he's the one who fired up this current hate mob.	22
1	Should point that out to feminists who bitch about the wage gap.	22
1	Suffice it to say that should we do another one of these in Portland, we will make sure the establishment knows exactly what's likely to go down beforehand.	22
1	That's some kindergarten level trolling, too.  "Say 'nigger' a lot, that'll make them super uncomfortable!"	22
0	Don't know about the laws in your country, but I wouldn't want laws in my country banning a site like "lawyers from hell".   Taking paid for removing people from it is another matter. That sounds like a form of extortion. But as far as I know, the block bot didn't do that?	22
0	I don't know cause I'm not on Twitter. If you look at my history I do actually have a couple Ghazi centric posts that have been very highly upvoted. She's since deleted this BTW so it's good that I captured it.  I'd say when there's information that only exists on ghazi it should be ok to post it. Really, I *still* don't see the harm in letting more posts through than not.	22

0	This explains why 'Rise of the Indies' managed not to interview the fairly accessible notch but found a hipster he-twink to represent one of the only notable games in the doc don't it?	22
1	did someone ask lizzy to make the same pose as in SVU? Cause if so that was genius.	22
1	You are trying way too hard.	22

0	at least you got some exercise riding those sweet bikes.	22
0	It's a dog whistle. He signals a target to his followers in a plausibly deniable way, and then they move in.  See the Storify. All those people attack in a coordinated manner right after McIntosh signals the target. That's not coincidence.	22
0	But "nigga" exists in the context of "nigger". There isn't a case where "nigger" isn't offensive, because it is the racist origin of "nigga" and has never meant anything else but its own racism, while "nigga" is almost always a term of endearment (except where used sarcastically to deride black people on the basis of linguistics).  [edit] I believe literally nothing I've said here is incorrect nor offensive. Say something, that's what comment threads are here for and it's the only reason I posted this.	22
1	Well, I doubt it was Chu or any prominent aGG who did it personally. But you do have Chu inciting harassment (in dot tweets so all his followers would see) against the venue just a few hours before the bomb threat was made, so it's not like they can completely dodge responsibility either.  The difference with the bogus shooting threat against Sarkeesian is that nobody in GG was aware of that event or cared about it or was actively trying to stop it.	22
1	&gt;Or is failing to finish the product your fans helped fund a feminist idea?  According to Anita it is.	22

0	Any chance of adding Boogie2988 to the list? I know he's a "neutral" and trying to stay out of it, but the guy's so full of love, I think it'd be a positive to have him there all the same.	22
0	Well, they didn't call you out by your personal name and threaten your income. It's not like they made your life worse in some hard-to-quantify way. Just because they insulted your political movement does not mean it's fair to witch hunt them.	22
1	&gt; To be fair, this sub has become rather obsessed with Feminism in general lately. Granted, it's a relatively recent thing (last month or so)   Not true, people have been anti-radical feminism from the very beginning. Remember Shirtgate? One Ghazi claimed that the reason for leaving Gamergate was the fact that KIA only talked about that issue for a week.   And considering how they put a target on out back and tried to destroy us, that isn't a surprise, either. We either fight back or we relegate ourselves to the dustbin of history.	22
1	That's like asking: "Why are all gays so effeminate?" They're not. You just don't notice the one that aren't.	22
1	MY NAME IS NOT IMPORTANT  WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS WHAT I AM GOING TO DO  I JUST FUCKING HATE EVERYBODY IN THIS WORLD AND THESE MISOGYNERD WORMS FEASTING ON ITS CARCASS  MY WHOLE LIFE IS JUST COLD BITTER JEOPARDY! AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO DIE ANSWERING QUESTIONS ON A GAME SHOW  THIS IS THE TIME OF ARTHUR CHU  AND NO GOOBLER GOBBLER IS WORTH SAVING  AND I WILL PUT IN THE GRAVE AS MANY AS I CAN  IT'S TIME FOR ME TO TWEET  AND IT'S TIME FOR ME TO DANK MEMED	22
1	**The New York Times Editorial Board** - A political group that objects to objectivity in journalism.	22
0	1) Within reason, yes. By reason I mean that it should adhere to the same restrictions as other forms of media- a detailed and accurate bomb-making game does not have the right to exist under the first amendment. 2) Yes, and I'm seeing a lot of parallels between the harassment that GG is receiving and the harassment that the IGDA is facing.	22
1	Lel these people are always afraid of comments	22
1	No, no, condemning them doesn't matter. Still guilty just like all of feminism is guilty of supporting gendercide, infantcide, and supporting rape by not condemning the well known first tenured lesbian teacher who advocated for that	22
0	To be fair, we don't allow debate here, either. I've stepped out of line in this sub and was met almost exclusively with insults and downvotes, just like I would expect over there.  Don't kid yourself: This place is an echo chamber, too.	22
0	i think a good tactic is to call the DC place ourselves and explain to them what's happening and let them decide... our rational explanations and weblinks vs. the histrionic whackjobs on the other side.	22
0	You think gamerGate has somehow changed the journalistic landscape?  May I recommend a brief survey course on the history of journalism, available for cheap at your nearest community college?  So far, gamerGate's "accomplishments" have all been directly contrary to its stated aims.	22
1	'Enforcement Branch'   Top fucking kek .	22
0	No? Who are you? I can comment on what I like. wtf is wrong with you. you're in KIA.	22
0	Nah I've read the Zoepost.   Its basically what you said it is.	22
0	I come for legitimate discussion, even if I do often disagree with how the issue is being presented (that's my main disagreement with GG: Not what they want but how it's presented and communicated).  That being said there's definitely some snark in my history, especially when my initial rational and well phrased disagreements get met with overly aggressive responses.	22
0	Right and he criticized the latter in his interview while staying on the side of the former.	22
0	And?  You sound like a dumb ass American that thinks the world is just like America, oh well glad to know it's not just my fellow countrymen that are this stupid.	22
0	I definitely won't buy it now, same reasons I will never buy Pillars of Eternity (despite I was planning to before the whole thing happened). I'm sure there's more people who feel the same way about that. In any case even if only a few people refrain from buying the game, the SJW crowd STILL won't buy the game no matter what, so it's a net loss anyway.	22
0	&gt;Become commonplace  Don't descend to SJW status by making wide sweeping claims like that. Sure you read about false rape claims on the Internet, but they're hardly commonplace. That's absurd. You should be ashamed of yourself.  Even if you see 100 posts on tumblr about claiming rape when it clearly didn't happen, that's still only 100 people out of the millions and billions that have Internet access, just like you can't say racism is commonplace on reddit because there are a handful of people who are subscribed to coontown.	22
1	Don't even need to apply logic to it.  He was acting as an agitator for it, since I don't know much on US law I can't say but in some places that's enough to have him declared an accessory to the crime.	22
0	Honestly, you come off as a little buttmad that the moderators of your community are actually engaging.  Guess what? We do feel like this is something worth talking about and that's why we're doing it. You gonna 'unelect' us just because there are certain concerns and we bring them to public for a public debate? You know nothing about this community if you find that out of the ordinary. No one's forcing anything, we're sharing our concerns and talking it out.	22

0	All of them so salty that they made the list... Didn't see them bitch when people were thrown into their block fest...	22
0	&gt;That depends. Are these things to the exclusion of gaming related topics?  No, but I do think the games ethics topics are getting lost in the swarm of other crap. They're certainly not getting followed-up, no campaigns like we used to have are being launched... it's all about the drama now.	22

1	Were you sleeping last week, when a Fox Host was interviewing Christina Sommers and was actually doing a great job at it. She also did some first rate SJW-bashing. Yup.. Welcome to Bizarro-land!	22
1	Boogie is just the ultimate fence-sitter. It's not even neutrality at this point, it's just not having anything interesting to stay.	22
0	I would say my disapproval is pretty active.	22
0	Yes, but if referring to you as the King of France were as important to your sense of self as being called by the preferred gender is to a trans-person, you'd probably be irritated, or feel disrespected if I made it very obvious to you that I was *only* referring to you as the King of France, but I didn't actually mean it, and nothing else in the way I behaved indicated sincerity.   In order to behave in a sincere way that would avoid antagonizing you, I'd have to do things above and beyond what I'd have to do to treat a male-sexed person as a woman.	22
1	&gt; "At least one of her speaking engagements was cancelled because of threats of mass violence. That incident and another involving a Washington Post blogger who faced similar scorn after writing about the state of gaming became known as Gamergate."  Anonymous reporter is so lazy they they can't even stick to the actual anti-GG narrative and invent a fresh story just for this piece.	22
0	&gt;that last sentence  t-thanks Kotaku	22
0	That's my point you fucking idiot.  But nice job pulling a sentence out of context to make your point.  I know another group of people who do that too.	22
0	We don't have a chance against MSM - but with gaming websites (which are increasingly becoming more authoritarian Left), we can do it.	22
1	You can still be a feminist using the old "equality" definition. There's a reason Anita put forward that definition when she was on Colbert. Most people agree with it, and think the third-wavers are loons.	22

1	Nothing about any of this was "supposed." They herded us all out of the building, they *specifically told us* there was a bomb threat, they swept the building, then they let us back in a little later.   According to one of the bartenders, they may have lost as much as $8,000 of business because of it.	22
0	&gt;ctrl F gamergate  &gt;11 hits  Damn Chu you really don't care.	22
0	Well ... Why? Do you have a better way to stop people from thinking we against women and that we support rape-culture?	22
0	I am talking figuratively.  In the end no one cares what either of us say. People don't have to ask for your permission to do anything was the point. Go ahead and deem people "enemies", but I have a feeling no one gives a shit.	22
1	I'm sure Milo's documenting and interviewing as we speak. Look at it this way, our opponents have both gift-wrapped a story and given it to a journalist who is already researched on this subject, as well as stirred the hydra that is DC law enforcement.  All they need to do now is start talking to each other.	22

1	True but having listening to all his GG interviews he always seems to put the kids gloves (in comparison I do agree he still asks some hard questions) on with people like Wu, Chu, and Kluwe.	22
0	while there's some truth to what you're saying, i would take ads masquerading as reviews over self righteous rich assholes moralizing and manipulating peoples' emotions any day of the week.	22
0	Oh, I think you're right about that. I misunderstood.  That just screams 'incorrect forum' if we have to use our powers to cut through a huge non-GG circlejerk. It's a huge argument *in favor* of separating that to its own thing.	22

0	I'm sorry but I'm with Manno on this. We come here to have a dialogue with the community and what do you do? You say no, but on top of saying no you're a jerk about it like NO NO NEVER NO NO!!! Well, guess what: the mods are member of the community too and there is enough interest among our subgroup in this group to feel we should bring it to a discussion. **Not a declaration**.  If you can't respect that and not antagonize the people putting in work to try to facilitate that dialogue you're not going to be making friends with me.	22

1	I love the "It all ends tonight."   I do hope he elaborates on this. He sounds really tough. I admit it. I see some wild eyed loon with messed up hair in a dark alley, I might think twice before steppin' to him.  Until I realized it was Arthur, then I'd give him a big hug and comb his damn hair for him.   I think Jay-Z put it best when he said...  "You know the type, loud as a motor bike... but wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight."	22
0	&gt;All of this falls under the category of what Gamergate is about now. And it should all be allowed here.  No, this is what you believe, not what GG is. There are plenty of people that think GG is spreading itself thin when it focuses on shit outside gaming in general. Threads about shit like "OMG this comic character is gay now" Don't belong on this sub, and only detract from the one thing we can all agree on, ethics in video games. Especially when subreddits exist for these topics.	22
0	I think there is space for some cross-over e.g. the Block Bot and Gamer Gate autoblocker) but it is becoming clear that a lot of people here came for the games journalism but discovered a more general desire to oppose the madness of the extreme SJW Tumblr tendency.  I think we should have an overflow subreddit and I agree SocialJusticeInAction is a good name.	22
1	It wasn't even that. He called something his "spirit animal" and was reamed for "cultural appropriation."	22
1	A defining characteristic of the people who get sucked into this stuff is that they are fucking stupid. That is a pattern I've noticed as well.	22
0	&gt; Saying "Free speech" = "Government" is a moronic statement.  I don't think I said that free speech = government, what I did say or imply is that you aren't entitled to free speech at all times say at places like a privately website, or a church, or your friends house. While in bad taste there is nothing to stop reddit from turning all comments off or deleting everything you say and there is nothing that says they can't legally as far as I know. All I'm saying I guess is use your best judgement when exercising your right to say whatever the hell you want.	22
0	&gt;  I'm not joining shit  You're kindly free to unsubscribe at any time.   By it's nature gamergate isn't joined or left. It's a fucking hashtag you dip. You either want to stop sjws milking gamers for their own means or you don't.	22
0	Send all the SJWs to Mars, I'm cool with it.	22
1	Well he (or she! Lots of crazed tumblrinas out there too) probably won't be saying much of anything without a lawyer present. But others, oh others? 100%. Definitely 100%. They blame GG on things that happened two years before GG existed.	22
0	Even if you disagree with him, you can't tell the guy he's incorrect. He gains nothing by lying about why he quit Twitter. The subject under fire is the movie, not his tweets.	22
1	"Are you comparing the assassination of Franz Ferdinand to GamerGate?"  He *just* qualified his statement before he said it to explicitly state it's not the same thing and he's just using a metaphor.  Do people these days not understand metaphors/anecdotes? Do they never think you can use a comparison to something to describe something else? That you can only use it if they're *identical?!* That's not how they work.	22
0	Lol, can't tell if total douchebag. Oh wait, yes I can. You're a douchebag! :)	22
1	Given a choice between his story and lighting the money on fire and watching it burn... could someone hand me a lighter?	22
1	I made a documentary about him this morning, but then I flushed.  I didn't realize he wanted a video!	22
0	It's tangentially related at best. How do we want to frame ourselves? This is a leaderless grassroots movement so everyone needs to think of that for themselves and I cannot answer that question for you or for GG. I don't even know if I have a clear answer for myself. You're right--there's a lot of angles to the story that is GG. But right now, I am simply not sure if this is our fight.	22
1	The thing that made me the happiest was that everyone just carried on partying after the police did their thing.  You done us proud, sockpuppets.	22

0	Alright, you asked for it.	22
1	Well when they define censorship as "government coming and knocking your door down and arresting you for what you write", and all they want to do is embolden insane people to murder the people they hate and tell people that "if they didn't want to get murdered, they shouldn't have triggered people".	22
0	He spews spaghetti all the time. Though I'm an occasional fan of his videos, he's in this for reasons tangentially related to the kind of ethical concerns SPJ would address as part of their mission statement.	22
1	If you want it reported send tips to MSM, shit son haven't we learned anything, start the thread on 8chan with all the email links, shill here and on Twitter, sit back and watch the world burn	22
1	What about that one person from IGN I think, who was in Mass Effect (3?) and like 99% of the playerbase hated her and kicked her off their ship/never let her on.  I didn't realise how long it's been since ME3 came out.	22
0	Please remove anything that is purely MRA related, there are enough other subs for that.   Anti-feminist or mens rights posts often get lots of upvotes here because a majority of visitors will agree with them, but it shifts the tone away from game journalism.  I'd prefer to allow SJW posts to remain so long as they are about media coverage of social justice abuses, of socjus influence over the media.	22
0	I concur. SJWs are the symptom, corruption is the disease. Just two decades ago, family values proponents were the SJWs of that time, pushing an agenda against gaming.	22
1	*THEY CANT ARREST ALL OF US*	22
0	And yet the majority of comments here aren't offended by what happened to Whedon but more so that Oswalt compared the Tea Party to liberals.   Those low intelligent right wingers are the same crowd as KiA. haha	22
0	Why do people keep giving this literally greasy fucker attention? He is nothing. You are giving him the attention he wants since no one gives a shit about his jeopardy stint anymore.  He keeps poking at you and you keep buying into it. Just let him fade into obscurity.	22
0	This probably breaks on Google Sites, but I might move to a proper host in a day or two, once the influx of info slows down.  Thanks for a constructive contribution.	22
1	It doesn't have to be valid. They'll just publish that "X bad guy belongs to Y group" regardless if it's true or not. The next time some dude snaps and goes to shoot up a school, and they find that he played CoD once, all the media outlets will try to relate that guy to gamergate.	22

I have heard the word "Marxism" a thousand times more often in GG spaces than I ever did in feminist spaces. The ***vast*** majority of feminists don't give a single insignificant fuck about Marx. This whole Marx thing is one of the few things that makes me embarrassed to be associated with GG.	22
1	I was pleasantly surprised by this as well. You can so taste the salt but... this is probably the most balanced article Kotaku has written on Gamergate, at least from what I've read.  I guess the narrative is starting to crack.	22
1	The truth is they won't write anything because they don't want to draw attention to anything that can alter the narrative	22
0	Me me me please. If you want to convince them that gamergate is only about ethics, I'm your man. I don't abide the MRAs or the culture war bullshit that some here can't stop talking about.	22

0	I was not "bullying" Yiannopoulos, if that is what you are implying. Yiannopouolos is a writer for a popular website and says all manner of inflammatory things; because of this, some people will not like him.

1	Hey guys.  Boogie here.  Having been receiving death threats since a decade before gg began can you possibly expect me to feel any different?  People suck.  I have never blamed gg when this shit happens to anita so you can't posible expect me to blame anita when it happens to you.  You guys know, I hope, that I will always have your back the best I can.  That's what this was.   Sorry if you are expecting me to point fingers on this but you know even if I could, I wouldnt.	22
0	He's talking about Anita condoning and insinuating it. No where are tweets by Feminist Frequency account showing this and Whedon said as well that Anita had nothing to do with it. They're also good friends IRL.  But yeah KiA ignoring direct quotes is a pretty common trend around here.	22
1	He can't actually research things. That's why he's a journalist.	22
0	&gt;How do you become so vitriolically hateful  Ironic, coming from someone who hates fat people, transgender people and probably also women.  &gt; yet hold yourself up as some kind of paragon of virtue?  How am i doing *that*? I just think that most of you are full of shit.   &gt;near-genocidal hatred keep you sufficiently warm at night?  Where is that coming from? Do you think i'm some kind of #killallmen tumblr feminist? I didnt write [this blogpost](http://www.fstdt.com/QuoteComment.aspx?QID=87815).  Also, it's actually my blanket that keeps me warm at night.	22
0	we're not playing for them because ppl don't trust the media like that in the 1st place &amp; we can dispell it with the hashtag it's WHERE you post harassment GG has received.  They use feminism as a shield this is where you use your guard break.  Make the brand toxic(sound familiar) &amp; difficult to associate with.  make any decent feminist smoke out the ones posted in the tag.  It's not like the media were doing us any favors anyways.  They'll get their views from their people and we'll find our own like we always do.	22
0	Angry gators made bomb threat because they want to drive women and minorities out of GamerGate.	22
0	Yea all I can say is that i've been with GG for a long time and it feels like a super betrayal  that people are advocating for the word slut.  This sucks.	22
1	Why is a male-dominated medium automatically assumed as bad? Why is this assumption accepted as gospel? Sometimes *men and women like different things* - the premise behind a field being ''male dominated'' often carries the connotation that it needs ''fixing'' - that's simply not true. We never see accusations that female-dominated fields need ''fixing''.  Anyway, meh - sounds like another faux-Feminist and SJW beta-male we've had to grapple with these past few months.	22

1	It's inaccurate because the objection is not to allegations of sexism per se, but the allegation that sexism is rampant with in gaming and the situation requires a cultural junta. The main objection was actually to the propaganda junta itself.  The idea that the MSM would mention that gamers were in a consumer revolt is of course, heretical to both the left and right of the political spectrum.	22

Make a mistake, double-down, and use the narrative around your mistake as a bludgeon against the people affected until you meet the devil that made your rotten soul in Hell.

1	I know for certain that I would rather have a large group of paying customers who aren't being too rowdy or causing trouble than the sort of people who complain about patrons of a bar *they're not even in*.	22

0	I think blockbots are a tool that can be useful when needed, and I think someone should have the right to filter what content is showing up on their social media accounts. People are quick to cry censorship, but you aren't always entitled to give your opinion on somebody elses soapbox.  When somebody is called out by GG on here, the tweets come in by the hundreds, Sometimes the signal-to-noise ratio necessitates the need of some filtering. And hey, some people just don't feel like debating. I unfollow people who say things I don't like and leave it at that.	22
1	I agree that the OP has a bad title. 'Left' is simplistic. I lean more towards the Left myself.  This is authoritarian vs libertarian. However the authoritarian in this case is the authoritarian far-Left.  Why do you think they love calling us right-wingers? And have far-Left sites shilling for them (The Guardian)?	22
1	The proper term for these people is "useful idiot."	22

0	New to commenting, been reading this since the start. I just don't agree with feeding a circlejerk. There is only negative things said about SJW's, similar to how ghazi only says negative things about GG. It seems like the same comments again and again from both sides.	22
1	Of course this article mentions that teleseminar shilling flannel idiot, as all garbage like this does.	22
0	&gt; I wasn't aware that mainstream commercial platforms were the only distribution model.  Strawman.  &gt;Or that promoting hate was an important social concern...  Another strawman. Wow, that was easy.	22
0	&lt;citation needed&gt; for some of that.  I also really don't care, take that shit to the appropriate places. We aren't fighting for "Men's Rights" here, but for a better gaming industry and against media bias. It's getting really annoying to see all these hijacking attempts by ideologues from the opposite end of the spectrum.	22
0	While I believe that discussion regarding SJW's and the likes are an important one, I'm not sure if KiA is the best platform to do it on. Or to put it another way: If we are to allow and encourage discussion of all manner of SJW escapades on this site, it will get increasingly harder to claim that GamerGate is all about the ethics in gaming journalism.	22

1	I thought the majority of inequality was in the wealthy, people with careers and shit.  That's why white women make more than black men in comparison to white men by like 10%.  Edit: side note weekly income wage gap between black men and black women is about 10%. Compared to about 20% for white women to white men.

0	&gt; TiA often gets the same stories much more coverage.  I don't check TiA. And I shouldn't have to.  &gt;but when has KiA ever advocated for action on a non-gaming related SJW issue?  Shirtgate. The Honey Badger Brigade. And those are just two off the top of my head.  I never said that decrease in "off-topic" (I use quotes because I don't think it is OT) posts would somehow be "declawing" KiA. I said that we benefit from having that information around to be discussed.	22
1	She looks great so I think it's an honest mistake :P	22
0	99% of what he says is just complaining. I'm not saying he's wrong to complain about many of the things he complains about, but very few of them have anything to do with ethical writing on the game industry.  SPJ = journalist ethics. They have no reason to care about identity politics outside of how they directly effect journalist ethics. Sargon goes...off-topic, let's call it...quite a bit. Which again, is fine, but not relevant to SPJ concerns. Which is why I'd prefer to see more focused people in the debate.   Sargon seems to agree, having officially dropped himself out of the running.	22
1	&gt; Also don't see anything wrong with the word apparent  It's being used as a weasel word to soften the article title.  Smarter people will pick up on this but Kotaku readers are utterly brain dead so they won't notice the direction they're being pushed.	22
1	aka Chloe Sagal.  aka tax dodging lunatic.	22
1	Even right off the bat Sargon makes a loose analogy about the Zoe post and fucking Pakman jumps in with a *gotcha* "so you think gamergate is like world war 1"? Oh just fuck off.	22
1	It's never harassment when it's directed at whites, men, straight people or cis scum. Let alone a company they own.	22
0	It's not about reaching out to women who want to "close the gender gap" because people without a genuine interest in STEM won't invest themselves in the field obviously.  It's about reaching out to women and *girls* who are legitimately interested in STEM, but may not have previously seen a STEM career as something *they could do*.  The people to target are women who may have not considered this career path due to their own misconceptions of the field or perceptions of their role in society.	22

1	I'm sure the gaming bloggers have plenty of "reasons"  (with +3 mithril-plated battle quotes) to spit on Nintendo.  - It's full of old-timey licences from when gaming was a nerd thing, so it's okay to pick on nerd things  - Saint Social Justice has deemed a lot of the games "problematic" in their images  - It's clickbaity because everybody, not only gamers, know Nintendo  - It's trendy  - They're insanely jealous that none of their games will have as much popularity as FF or Castlevania games  - Japanese culture is deemed muh-soggy-knees-stick, or has "problematic" views on sex   - reasons	22
1	I'm aware of *who* they are. I'm just tired of all the shit drama they have on twitter. Especially as of late. And yeah, Ayyteam got buttmad and "left" but it's all they fucking talk about and basically yell "LOOK AT ME NOT CARING"	22
1	That's pretty much it. We have clearly gone past the threshold of sanity. I said this many times before, but with this kind of fanaticism, they will start to justify violence or even murder as long as their precious narrative is upheld. Hell, even some CULTS have been less brazen about supporting violence or threat of violence.   I'm afraid this is just going to keep rolling downhill. All the way to the bottom. They better take these threats seriously or else we'll have a real terrorist situation to contend with.	22

1	As someone who genuinely couldn't see it (I'm bad with stuff like this). I'd like to know what gives it away?	22
1	Bomb threat upon release of further information. Slightly different.	22
0	oh my goodness, do you people *hear* yourselves??? "We are for ethics in gaming journalism, but also, we are against the feminist cabal that is threatening to destroy life as we know it."  This is why not a single games publisher takes anything you people say **remotely** seriously.	22

0	So in a subreddit largely based on skepticism, I'm 'quite suspect' for being skeptical on whether a strawpoll that samples less than 1% of the general 'population' is possibly falsified, even a bit?  I could make the argument that the fact you created a thread just to scream about how "unfair" the mods were when they told you to take a thread that was not even tangentially related to the sub to one that was designed for that very topic would make your opinion in this thread 'suspect'.  Seriously man, All I'm saying is that Strawpoll is never going to be a useful tool because it's just too easy to falsify.	22
1	This part was just amazing:  &gt; Twitter user Arthur Chu was among the people found allegedly harassing the bar patron, Christina Sommers, who goes by the handle Local 16 and allegedly supports GamerGate. They had spent much of the day hounding her with questions about whether she knew she was hosting an alleged hate group that night.	22
1	So a bunch of Asian/White males are calling up a place and saying that a Woman (Sommers) and Homosexual man (Milo) are leading a misogynistic/homophobic hate group gathering at their restaurant.   How do we arrive at these small points of extreme irony and still have these idiots try to maintain the narrative with a straight face. Man, Chu--just admit you don't like us; and explain it that way, at least be honest.	22

0	&gt;I have full confidence in Chairman Pao.  Just wait until they fuck up to punish them. Pao seems like a pretty horrible person but there hasn't been any indication that she's been responsible for any of the problems that the community has had with the site.  &gt;Also, my building has terrible cell reception.  Iktf, also you've done it again.	22
1	Over at Ghazi they are all nodding their heads saying how much they knew that this is, of course! is the norm for GG. I wonder if they will take all their comments back or just ignore the update and continue on.	22
1	It's funny because they claim to be for dismantling the patriarchy and empowering women but what's their first instinct when they want something to happen? Call in a bunch of uniformed men tasked with preserving the status quo.	22

0	Nice game industry post there.	22
1	I think it says something about someone's character when they're happy to readily buy a narrative when confronted with someone politely trying to open up discussion. And I guess some people picture a character when they see an actor: if I saw Daniel Radcliffe, I'd see Harry Potter. It's certainly interesting to see these people spend so much of their careers portraying characters who stand for truth and justice end up taking nothing from it, ready to jump to the first bandwagon that brings them validation.	22
1	Devi fucking ever to the rescue with more insane bullshit.  The teets of this lolcow keep on giving.	22

0	&gt; Tor doesn't really have a political lean to it tho  Whether or not they do, two of their editors and one of their writers have been attacking others for their politics and Tor has failed to do anything about it.	22
0	Joss Whedon deserved to be harassed off of Twitter. He has been enabling these demented creeps for the longest time. Now the crocodile ate him. Still, this did lead to a huge backlash that we can use against the SJWs. Whenever a SJW starts screaming about death threats, just ask: do you mean the ones you guys sent Joss Whedon?	22
1	He is also one of the top all time contributors to Humble Bundle and has given to many charity livestreams over the course of him having some pengar in his pocket.	22
0	Most anti-Nazis are batshit insane leftists, they are in many ways like SJWs and in some ways a lot worse, for instance a lot of them are actually extremely violent in real life. I guess you have to be batshit insane to take neo-Nazis seriously.	22

0	Absolutely agree. In fact I think many of these corrupt journos/media owners aren't believers in the SJwar at all, but they very much enjoy taking cover behind the SJWs and letting the SJWs do the fighting for them. How many have been caught having said things a couple years ago that would have them burnt at the stake by SJWs if spoken today?	22

1	I'm curious as to what tremendous damage to his life gg has caused?	22
0	&gt; It is the line between hate speech and satire and it is important for this context.  "Hate speech" is a way of working around free speech by categorizing some ideas as unacceptable.  There's a difference between calling some guy a faggot so that a crowd attacks him, which was the reason for the original hate speech laws, and making a game in the abstract about killing homosexuals.	22

0	As a Hatman loyalist, I would only like to say that you should go with your gut on this.  I think you have good instincts as to what the overall direction of the sub should be.  No matter what you do, there will be a portion of the population that gets pissed off and throws a tantrum.  In the end, the people who care firstly about moving GG forward will understand and continue participating here.	22

0	He claims that he wasn't making a reference to Mercedes' race, but rather he was simply making a joke on the fact that the word "nacho" sounds sort of similar to "not your." I'm inclined to believe him, just because that has middle aged mom humor written all over it.	22

0	I still remember the first I saw of Devi Ever. It was quote mining from a TFYC stream, and calling people calling her out on it harassment. Payed no more attention to her, then suddently I see her as pro-GG, found it a bit weird, but anyone is allowed to post to GG if they fight for games journalism, so didn't think much of it. I think I might have even followed her. But in the end, she was still the same person I first saw.	22

That's all I was saying. :)	22

0	Thank you.  This sitting here and slurping it up when devs nut over their faces is what puzzles me about GG. You think the industry got this bad without fuckin' everyone pitching in? You think this problem wouldn't vanish in a hurry if devs weren't spineless cunts with a poor sense of who actually buys their games?   Right. Sure. I completely believe that. /s	22

1	Nah, his best GG interview was the Wu interview.  He absolutely blew her out of the water and thats why hes on this penitence tour now.	22
1	I think it's important to note how he writes it though. He doesn't say we are a hate group or the usual spiel. He presents it as what it is, an opinion. He writes how he has personal distaste for gamergate, which is pretty refreshing, letting the reader make their mind up.  Sure, a bit of bias still shows, but it's a step in the right direction	22

Had there been any legitimate threats to Anita, you can be damn sure police would have done something.	22

0	Yeah it's not like being on this list is causing any reputational damage to anyone on it. The criteria for being on these lists are "follows these accounts", not "is a horrible person", and there are no particular untruths attached to someone's name on the list. And people have to opt-in to use the lists, not like people are being forced to bear censorship.   Sounds like gamergate is trying to engage in the same censorship it says is bad.  There's a bigger issue that this petty case is going to set bad precedent especially with people who maintain opt-in blocklists for other purposes.	22
1	Yup.  In other news GG's FBI file has another entry.	22

Yep, thanks for confirming your anti-mod bias and membership of AyyTeam.	22

I remember when he showed up in KiA claiming to have received thousands of death threats from us. When pressed for evidence all he could produce was one snarky tweet from a brony. He promptly "fucked off" and never came back. Nice to see he still cares.	22

0	LGBTQ righs campaigns did their jobs 10-15 years ago and are done.  These days "LGBTQ rights" is synonymous with oppressing christians, and I say this as someone who is *not* christian and generally despises christian fundamentalist invasions of liberty.  They have a right not to associate with gays which is being violated, and I think provisions against slavery, for equal protection under the law, and protecting an individual's right to choose whom they associate with to be just as important for these fundies as for gay people.	22

0	&gt;What do you think is motivating the corruption in game journalism?  The same thing that's it's been for the last twenty-thirty years: the press relies on access from the same publishers that they are also expected to fairly judge. Also corporate PR treating the press as their marketing  Do you honestly think that if everyone in video games and VG journalism magically became right wing social conservatives that there would be no problems with ethics in game journalism?	22
1	Bob Gamergate. Guy's an asshole.	22

1	It was, at most, an inconvenience for those that were there. It was also a massive waste of time for DC police. If we're delighted, it's because of the potential consequences for the person/people involved in the threat. I don't think they'll ever be the same.	22

Like in the Vox video where he got slapped with 10 year old articles he barely remembered and just thought "I might have wrote it" and started defending. Meanwhile he never did, the headline Pakman mischaracterized there was from an editor and didn't reflect the piece. Pakman is very dirty in his questions.	22

0	&gt;Adding more post tags, such as the proposed [Censorship] tag.  I'm actually with this.  This will keep the off-topic tag from looking too "generic".  The other thing I can think of is cross-linking to SJInAction when someone makes a post here, to encourage people to start posting over there.  The problem is if you make spinoff boards, most of us don't migrate there because KiA is just too convenient of a place to talk about all kinds of stuff.  It's kind of a toughie, unfortunately.	22

The ASA's issue was with the dodgy claims the company was making about their weight loss products.	22
0	What's an SJW exactly? That term is commonly defined as a vague pejorative, no person that is labeled as such uses that to describe themselves as far as I can see. Also "Social Justice" seems to be the most important words in the "Social Justice Warrior" pejorative, so I felt that's who you were talking about.	22
0	&gt; From my perspective, you need us. We don't need you, and the IGDA needs to go a long way to justify its continued existence.  I disagree, the IGDA doesn't need us people who play video games, it needs developers who participate in the organization. These developers need gamers to play their game, but that's another thing.	22

I think metal used to upset people because they don’t understand the music itself, rather than lyrical themes. Hatred is making people crazy, because of its context, not because its shell. If we were to make the same game but with any other plot, they would accept it with no problems.  Seems particularly relevant.	22

The preferred method of reporting any issue is to provoke outrage, which in our case is labeling us as bigoted fascists. The media has been universally against GG and has been against gamers as a culture since....forever. The time for discussion or a dialogue with these people has passed.  Fuck them. Bring down their temple, don't join it. GG has nothing to gain from participating in their bait conference.	22

0	Indie Fund requires 100% of gross revenue from a game until their investment is reimbursed. Without a breach of contract, the developer doesn't really have a choice about how money from sales is used until the loan's repayed   But, you're right, money coming in for development shouldn't go right to investors/publishers/whatever, it should come from developers. Customers shouldn't be involved until the game is totally done. I agree with you, Early Access has glaring issues, and I don't patronize it either.	22

What turned out was that the money from customers went to reimburse the original project investors and not to the continued development of the game.   For them it's a success story of how they can release a game on Early Access and make enough money to turn profit for the investors without risking their own money or even putting the effort to finishing the game.	22

Sad puppies, on the other hand, was the perfect example off allowable off-topic. It wasn't directly gaming related, but sci-fi and gaming have always been close, and the controversy mirrored ours fairly well.  So I guess I would say moderation needs to be moved, at most, one notch up. It's in a pretty good place right now, and I think the current front page reflects that.	22

EDIT: I am not a sad puppy but I support them in what they're trying to achieve  I also support homeschooling, gun ownership and like working out but that doesn't mean homeschooling groups, the NRA or bodybuilding.com are part of gamergate.

1	If they were really against goat sodomy in journalism, they would spend far more time decrying their journalists who engage in goat sodomy.  They do so little against it that it makes me think they endorse goat sodomy in journalism.	22
0	(abridged) American people are critizing why somebody across the Pacific is not making anything good as of late.  *ahem* Interests, values, and [this](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPolynomial). The world arguably goes in cycles of good and bad.	22
1	Now I need to rewatch "Robin Hood: Men in Tights".	22
1	Can't wait to read a snarky reply, if anything.	22
0	Asking for reason and sanity is shilling now, right?	22
1	I like how the top comment on Ghazi right now wants the lurking gaters to have some damned fine evidence before pointing fingers.   Conveniently forgetting they accusd GG of harassing women with no damned evidence at all. Fine or otherwise.	22
0	\*spit-take*  Well played, my friend.	22
1	Wait, GG is being blamed for the Baltimore RIOTS or the Cabal shit that Buzzfeed is pushing as true despite confessing in their own article that it is completely made up.	22
0	but this is a sub with a clear anti fem sound. this is the other POV- moderate feminism and a rational look about it.	22
1	And again we see the major difference between gg and agg - Combed hair.	22
1	The worst thing is that he is a married man.	22
1	The "offensive" link in the article is to a Jace Connors article. Not much more needs to be said to be honest.	22
1	No no no, it's third party trolls this time since it was something bad that happened to us and not them.  Don't you know how this works?	22
1	lol. just lol.  How sad their lives are.	22
0	Is that what I said? Because I can assure you it was not.	22
1	Excellent. The world needs more like you. Thousands more.	22
1	Except my mom, she's pretty cool and only has a few cooties.	22
1	its not really *spreading* - it's the same SJW hipsters in different places.  but this is kind of up there with those "I got banned from ghazi" posts we were flooded with last fall. you know they're a hugbox, and you know you'll get banned for breaking narrative. it's not really news.	22
0	&gt; Whether or not she runs a con is between her and her backers.  She's a hack fraud and pointing it out is not unrelated.	22
1	Remember that Buzzfeed is a reliable source for Wikipedia, and that the author also wrote for The Guardian	22
0	Seems like a joke (or I hope it is), but still unprofessional.	22
1	Of course we're delighted.  It shatters the narrative of one way harassment towards the SJW crowd, your non-coverage demonstrates that you are pushing a narrative based on your political leanings, and it gives us an opportunity to show the proper way to react to cowards trying to fuck with you over the internet.  We're going to use this as evidence in favor of our argument for a loooong time.	22
0	He seen gamergate circle jerk about him leaving and decided to wreak us. The people actually defending him against this bullshit.	22
1	Related to this, perhaps?  https://archive.is/44ZJu	22
0	The UK media is largely right wing, it's almost completely partisan. UK is controlled by Murdoch etc.  The Guardian is the only respected left wing publication really.	22
0	The user said:   &gt; but don't expect rational, thinking people to always agree with you.  I didn't put up anything to agree with either, just a picture. Why are you calling me out for that but not the other user for the same thing?	22
1	The trouble lies in the fact that the SJW mentality runs rampant in games media, but isn't limited to games-media.  Its presence in other cultural spheres is evidence of a larger issue that Sargon typically addresses, and while NOT being gamergate, still contains a number of the same tactics, personality-types, corruption and scandals.  There is a distinction between GG and everything else, but that's only because GG is its own front in a larger cultural phenomenon.	22
0	Not interested. This comes across as a "Red-pills, Assemble!" from the comments so far. (And for fuck's sake, don't try to offline plan some spaghetti-sperging at SMASH or whereever.)  Plus the pubs in Sydney are tourist-trap level crap. The only dining I liked in the CBD was the Yum-cha.	22
0	This has literally nothing to do with Gamergate whatsoever.  Why is it here?	22

0	Didn't some false rape thing happen for a similarly stupid reason in the UK?  A girl claimed she was raped to get out of seeing her boyfriend for some silly reason.  Can't remember the story offhand but it seriously fucked up the guy's life.	22
1	His age is a large part of his behavior. Part of what fuels his angst is that he hasn't' achieved anything in life.   He's devoted everything to "games journalism" and while that shouldn't be a tawdry career choice, a huge amount of people have only antipathy for him.  He's also managed to not actually improve at his craft through all the years- he's not particularly funny or clever or insightful, in a world where through the internet, hundreds of clever, witty writers can be summoned in minutes.   He's awful. And deep down he knows it.	22
0	Ugggghhh dude. Come on. I bet thats  exactly what the  chicks donating to the Fem Frequency kickstarter said to each other on Facebook.	22
1	we need to do this with all the garbage bloggers like him post	22

1	The tertiary issues all stem from what we were faced with in the early months... We criticized the media, and the media tried to send feminists after us (given that feminist social media campaigns and SocJus campaigns had successfully destroyed people in the past... Games media was hoping that would happen to us) we fought back against their bullshit attacks, and thus you have this "GG is antifeminist" narrative BS... Most successful Strawman they ever utilized.  In reality GG isn't antifeminist, GG is anti dishonesty.	22

1	most of ISIS are western educated muslims who migrated from europe back to the middle east with an extremist ideology they wish to impart on people they barely know and want to push their narrative, and use social media to push propaganda.  Sound familiar?	22
0	In fairness, blacks still have to teach their kids how to be subservient to cops to increase their chances of survival during routine stops. (Levar Burton has a video about it) I think blacks deserve a month.	22
1	We have to admit things are weird now though. No, certainly not all us left wing folks are at fault, but nearly all of our media and many prominent voices are.  It is all quite odd to see happening. I never realized there were so many extreme ideologues in the left. It seems after Bush many young progressives believe being progressive somehow inherently makes you correct and justified on any given topic.	22
0	Sounds about right.  GG in its early days was stoked by /pol/ agitators, now those agitators have found another target.	22
1	Holy fucking shit, that is an incredible smack down. I am literally chin-hanging-loose amazed he managed to walk away from that without fucking 5th degree cosmic burns.	22

1	The funny thing is, it's like the most RANDOM fucking mishmash of genres shoved together into one game and it WORKS.  Also I heard this game is actually pretty popular with women too!  Who would've thought?	22
0	&gt; [This spreadsheet]()   Nice link.	22
0	It's out-of-context and hyperbolic.  And the thing is, you don't even need to exaggerate Arthur, the guy is fucking loony tunes.  I just hate that some (not all) pro-GG are actually saying that he was threatening the venue when we know damn well that's not what it was, he just worded it badly.  I'm all for the memes that came out of it though, so I guess that's something.	22
1	\#GamerDate  Edit: I accidentally a markup language format.	22
0	&gt; My point is that your smugness doesn't make you right  Doesn't make what right? Pointing out the previous commenter's completely false understanding of those terms? What is incorrect about what I pointed out?  Again, why are you triggered? Do you have any point to make? What are you whining for?	22
0	He is a leading voice in the movement and people are rallying to have him speak for it on this whole media panel. This thread was phrased in the form of a question and I looked for and found one possible reason. It's asinine to get offended over a fact.   The downvote brigade on this just illustrates what an echo chamber GamerGate can be.  Do you not see that this sort of behavior compromises the ethical focus of this movement? Ganging up against facts and disavowing them or shouting them down when they don't fit your narrative is supposed to be a SJW deal.	22
1	Have you seen the "he touched my boob" (he didn't) feminist who then threw a guy on the ground in a way he hurt his head?  It doesn't take much for them. It is for social justice and the greater good after all.	22
1	But but but  Bob Chipman said  Doing a good thing and getting a reward  Is right wing philosophy  Meritocracy is dead  Guys  Meritocracy  Right wing  Moviebob  The real world should work on handouts  Maybe money shouldn't even exist  Because money is right wing	22

0	Can you name one example of an Avenger doing something stupid which undermines what is not only one of their core competencies, but the specific skill which they are supposed to be using in that particular scene? Also, do you seriously think that scene couldn't have been filmed such that Black Widow dropped the teary act and informed her teammates of what she'd "learned" immediately after leaving Loki instead of while she was still talking to him?	22
0	Of course it should remain on Greenlight. If the content is truly so awful, then the developers will be damned by their own ideas. Shutting them up just makes people think you're afraid of what they're saying or have such a weak argument you wouldn't dare face them in the open. This applies to all forms of expression. Personally, I'm not interested in the game in the slightest and the name disgusts me.	22

1	&gt; Walker is a very ethical and mature journalist: http://i.imgur.com/WLAFUfb.png  Better part of fifteen years I'd been reading stuff by John Walker, those posts are what stopped me from reading RPS from then on. Bear in mind those tweets weren't made after everyone had decided to dig their trenches and settle in for the long haul, it was a few days after the shit hit the fan, everything was in the air, but right off the bat these writers are telling their readers to fuck off.	22
0	You reacting like a child throwing a temper tantrum is doing nothing to support your "were already legitimate!" argument.	22
0	Remove anything that is not gaming related. It's called GAMERgate people.	22
0	Exactly.   Bullshit post is bullshit. OP is way the hell off-base.	22
1	This is beyond a felony at this point. You do this in the nation's capital when there's still very present fears about terrorist activity.  Throw the book at these people.  I really hope they are tried for terrorism.	22
0	beautiful comment. Especially love this part:  &gt;Who is this "we" form you use at the end? **You're not a developer; you're a reporter.** With whose voice are you speaking here exactly? And for what purpose?  maybe part of the dissonance is some reporters' beliefs that they share the exact same experience as game devs. Which is complete BS of course. journalism =/= programming, modeling, nor designing.	22
1	Wow. I stopped reading RPS at least 2 years ago, but that podcast clip is just out of this world. Could probably make a drinking game with the number of times Walker defensively uses "lazy" to make an argument. Contrarily I like how the other guy waits about 20 minutes to say "I think 'offensive' is a dangerous and lazy word and it can mask dangerous and lazy people" which was *so much more powerful* than repeating it over an over in a defensive accusation. The podcast seriously adds layers of context to my opinion of him.	22
0	&gt; For others GamerGate is a great tool in the culture war.  Those cunts can get fucked.  Just as the loonies have hijacked feminism, we get the opposite loonies hijacking Gamergate.	22

0	So make it absolutely nuts, like he thinks people are really flesh robots and he's the only real person in the world, or he thinks that by making the statement of shooting everyone he will usher in a new world order, or something absolutely insane like that. They don't have to write the whole thing out, just give us the jist of it.	22
0	Yes this should exist. People seem to forget that freedom is the right to choose between the good and the bad and not just the "good". I'm not in support of this game but I will defend it's right to exist even if I'm not a homophobe. Hate speech is and should be covered by Freedom of Speech.	22

0	Hey I've got an idea lets not tell people how to think. Whedon does not feel that the abuse was the reason. How the fuck could any of us know what he's thinking? The only thing speculation is doing is making us look like conspiracy nutjobs.	22
0	&gt; a bomb threat to Anita that didn't even include the words gamers, game or GamerGate, was still GG's fault, and it was gospel  didn't the bomb threat Anita received was signed by Mr Repzion and #gamergate? That's what the FBI said when they paid him a visit.	22
1	&gt;Just because Milo has our back **once in a while**  This isn't fair. I agree with your sentiment, but there is no need to downplay his overall investment in GamerGate.	22
0	I don't understand this viewpoint at all. Games journalism has been broken long before tumblr and the recent rise of outrage culture. Do you really think that if everyone in the industry became social conservatives that there would be no ethical problems in game journalism?  The root of the problem is greed and a lack of institutional separation between publisher Pr, journalists, and marketing.	22
0	That word makes me shudder. He may have been an empty shell of (half) a man fuelled only by his hatred and regret, but I'd still love to see Vader dealing with SJWs.	22
1	These are the same people who tried to justify the terrorist attack against Charlie Hebdo. They complain about 'punching down' while punching down at people who are six feet under the ground, because of the people they sympathize with. These people include FullMcIntosh, Katherine Cross, Little Hitler and Arthur Chu.  Because something something social justice.	22
1	&gt;She (?) says it was a joke after all  Ah, I see she's using the [McIntosh defense](http://i.imgur.com/Odw22bF.jpg)	22
0	Exactly what it says, ways you can recognize a feminist in a crowd or on a forum or in a comment section, etc.  You can tweet about characteristic feminist and SJW behaviors as they relate to #GamerGate, without using the #GamerGate tag as much as possible, so you don't negatively impact the original tag's trendability. You can also post screenshots of or links to feminists and SJWs being ridiculous. /r/KiAChatroom, /r/ShitGhaziSays, /r/PoesLawInAction, /r/TumblrInAction are good resources.	22
1	I think you'd have to be pretty stupid to not realise the bomb threat is a horrendous PR for anti-GG and further destroys the narrative they are peddling to the masses. It's perfectly reasonable for us to be happy when our opponents fuck up monumentally.	22
0	I've had enough of these threads.	22
1	&gt; The game is actually available for backers and should be out either very soon or now for non-backers.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacebase_DF-9#Controversy  &gt;The other thing didn't happen.

0	There's no hope for anyone that stupid in the first place. Loosen up, nig. The more you relax, the more fun you have and the more you can laugh at buzzfeed getting rused this hard.	22
1	That's exactly what it is. They are inciting fear for political goals. It is textbook terrorism. Now if its a troll they will still be tried for terrorism even though their goal was lulz.	22
1	More or less.  We're the new normal, and we just have to keep up the pressure until the narrative crumbles. Even if it *doesn't*, results are enough. Developers know we exist. "Beach Body" campaigns are doing better than SJW-pandering. We've made a *real* dent in advertising and made it so developers who censor have to fight a deluge of criticism.  Still a lot of cleaning-up to do, and then some rebuilding, but we *are* the chemo to the cancer killing gaming.	22
1	a very good example of insanity right there folks.	22
1	"I will rape you and kill you" &lt;- life is in danger, shut everything down, leave house, call FBI.	22
1	Yep Devi Ever. Let's remind the entire string of names this weirdo has had.   Why would anybody give that person money. Blew the money it raised on Kickstarter, resulting in a large debt.

0	Ah, this argument again.  What gives *anyone* the right to decide? If we're all leaders, then we all get to decide. If we're not, then who gets to pick?  If no one can decide what GamerGate is, if no one has the right to, then what the fuck are we doing together? I mean, if we're just going to be an amorphous blob where everyone has their individual ideas about what we're doing and what we want to accomplish, we won't do anything.	22

0	I wish you guys would realize that this person knows full well how ridiculous what they're saying is, but that every time she says something, you guys feverishly pleasure yourselves to how stupid it is - spreading the link far and wide in the process  She's making money off you.

0	Teachers like you are the reason I started to homeschool my children.	22
0	Exactly.It is all confusing. We are for equality and diversity but we need straighten out certain things like the whole anti-women sentiment people think we have against everyone. This is why we need to find a bunch of feminists who ARE reasonable and willing to work with us together to deal with the radical feminists. Ultimately its all about fixing our image and not about tags or labels.	22
1	What's the difference between the Calgary Expo and GamerGate?  Calgary has kicked women out.	22
1	Yeah, I think that's the prevailing attitude around "post/anti/old-wave feminist" circles. Not to claim that's the only factor, just the largest. There *is* misogyny out there, and it certainly steers some women away from careers billed as hostile. But changing that(which hopefully will happen) won't magically make a bunch of women who aren't interested in STEM switch majors, because they made that choice themselves. So the gap won't change much.	22
0	Is this a race to see who is the bigger victim?	22
1	Late to the party, but take a look at the guys comment history.  He will get that pink haired lardass pussy any day now.	22
1	There's being "not mentally sound", and then there's "making a bomb threat in Washington DC". At that point, you jump beyond "not mentally sound" into full blown "get them a straight jacket and a padded cell!" territory...and that's being generous!	22

0	I don't vote because I believe it lends credibility to the current system's illusion of a public voice.  Brand deconstruction of the ones that seek to, already have, or currently profit from the government is the best course of action for real change.  edit: Well I guess the real reason I don't vote is because I think both parties are batshit insane.	22

1	I think it has something to do with them listening and believing the bush administration party line, that pissed a lot of people off.	22
0	Uhh, where did you read any of that?  I can't quite find anything in the linked piece that says any of that.	22
0	Much as I dislike the tumblr crowd, I'm not here to fight an ideological war - can go to TiA for that and do it a lot more effectively.   This stuff is making the sleazes who picked up "social justice" in 2008-10 for clickbait/harassment purposes look like sincere activists.  It's playing into the hands of the people calling us right-wingers or reactionaries.    Don't let Gawker apologists see this as my side versus theirs or left versus right - make them defend the indefensible, because the way game journalists have treated their enemies is indefensible.	22
1	&gt; The other thing didn't happen  Really? [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo9_8u_Ctf0) isn't real? Amazing how they were able to record an event that "didn't happen".	22

0	"Seems", but it's only describing the sale of a sub-human.	24
0	It has my full support.  Though I should say that it must include a thorough description of our sexual faculties and their function.  There should also be lessons on the roles and responsibilities of parents as well as resources and information on marriage.      The only alternative I can think of is one that condones fornication, contraception, and other grave moral evils.  Children are good and loving them makes us more human.  The corruption of sex does the opposite.	24

An image of a tortured, executed corpse hung for display and submerged in filth becomes beautiful because its subject is Jesus. Its hard to communicate a message more powerful than that.	24
0	&gt; In a perfect world, yes, but that's not what happens  But that's exactly what happens. People don't read or reply to topics they're not interested in or tired of.  &gt;Instead it just causes the same arguments every week and nothing ever changes.  Because people aren't tired of discussing those topics yet.  Look at the gay wedding cake topic. For a while we had two or three a day. Now its been days since the subject has come up (actually miss having at least one). And this happened without dead horse censoring.	24
0	Same sex marriage is evil, it says so directly in the bible ( 1st Timothy chapter 1)	24
1	Humour aside, fantastic work.	24
0	The medical condition of a person wanting to be married is not what's on trial. Their sex (I.e. male or female, not the sexual act) is.	24
0	You're saying genetics, I'm saying it can be a result of genetics and social conditioning.  Now if you agree with me, then stop trying to disagree with me for the sake of trying to disagree with me.	24
0	Well no, I still have good relationships with people and I'm doing fine in school. On the outside, nobody would know that I have this obsession.	24
0	My question goes back again. Did the apostles, the Church Fathers their successors believe in the Book of Concord?	24
1	More than half lose their virginiy before marriage? I was being pessimistic, it seems, I would have thought it was near 98%.	24
1	Methulselah means "his death shall bring."	24
1	My first girlfriend was a non believer. As much as I liked her I broke it off because she wasn't a Christian. The issue is that we need a partner who will help us grow in our own faith supporting it and nurturing it, as well as us for them. I mean on top of that, what are you going to do if you do get married and have kids? Will you force them to attend church with you against the will of your wife? How will you negotiate that? There is a really good sermon series on it, called Boy Meets Girl , can't remember who it's by though sorry.	24
0	So it's your position that Jesus would have refused to feed people if it were a same-sex wedding?	24
1	The point still stands. "Thanks for not smiting me"  A god who points a gun to your head and says "love me" is no God of love.	24
1	It's not a bad question-asking why a political party uses church teaching to push an agenda is a perfectly good question! Your implications, however, aren't so appropriate.	24
0	I don't assume that Paul was conflicted or that he contradicted himself.  I think he was flatly pro-marriage, not intending to reject the older, Semitic traditions of his ancestors, and that the idea that he intended to exalt celibacy as morally superior to marriage, is a misunderstanding of Paul and the complex situation that the early church was in.	24
0	Ooh, how entertaining.	24
1	She sounds like she might be mentally ill. She thinks she's God's ambassador on earth, and seems to think US district courts are in a position to rule on religious questions.	24
1	You've got it. May God give you strength to overcome the obstacles of this world, and the peace that surpasses all our understanding.  If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm always here and you can always post here for support. I hope things get easier for you.	24
1	It's beautiful he can see this? It's the main message of Jesus, it's the main thing to see! I wish more of us Christians saw it.	24
0	Now gay sex is accidental and can only be done occasionally?  Nice try, bigot.	24
1	Mostly my upbringing and family influence. My upbringing was guided by scripture though, so yeah.	24
1	I have never not seen this as a gif. Interesting.	24
1	&gt; But articles like this make the problem worse, not better.  No, it's just people like you who make the problem worse. I honestly read that thinking that it was kind of ridiculous that anyone would be need to be told these extremely obvious things. Little did I know there would be someone to refute the idea of treating people with the most basic amount of respect and simply understanding the basic facts about homosexuality.	24
0	That's true, however some of these principles seem to contradict things said in the Bible itself. Praying to anyone other than God is idolatry by my belief, and this is mentioned multiple times.	24
0	Why do you say that? Isn’t it a college? And they are considering same-sex marriage evil...Ah, I understand, you mean that same-sex marriage is a contradiction in itself right? Haha, you are right mate. Thanks for telling me.	24
0	Then posit a sensible question.	24
1	That's called privilege, buddy	24
1	Don't let yourself be alienated from them. Make sure they know they're loved. This isn't your fault either, don't let those thoughts creep up on you.	24
1	&gt; mix communists with near-Catholics  ...   Mate.	24
0	I'm curious as to what law they broke, I'm not asking out of spite but genuine curiousness. All I see here is one couple saying I'm sorry but we are unable to bake you a wedding cake to another couple because of their beliefs. As far as I'm aware of that's all they did, not blacklist them from the baking community, the gay couple could still have bought a cake from a different store.	24
0	Lmfao this fucking subreddit I swear to God.	24
0	how about [Book Of The Month Club](http://www.literaryguild.com/welcome/)? since he's into fiction anyway  \* wow, people really hate book of the month club around here	24
1	Its not an odd question. It gets asked [a lot](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/search?q=aliens&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all)  The Bible doesn't mention America or Dinosaurs, both things that exist (or existed in the case of extinct animals).	24
0	&gt; The last church I was a part of made that case with The Matrix.  Any sermon based on a movie misses the entire point of what a sermon is.	24
0	to follow that to the logical conclusion, then it is morally just to kill children before they age where they are no longer "innocent" to keep them from going to hell, even at the risk of going there yourself.  If you would risk your life to save a child, would you not risk your soul to save 10-20-30 souls from eternal torture?  Since christianity has always been big on self sacrifice what could be more self sacrificing than offering up your own soul to save many others?	24
1	Well, not in the US. It's a legitimate concern in countries with state churches.	24
0	True, it's "intolerant fanatics fighting each other, with a sprinkle of greed towards the end (IVth crusade)."	24
1	Thank you for this. I am currently questioning my faith right now too, and it is difficult to reconcile these things.  Knowing that others are going through it too at least makes me feel a little better about it.	24
1	Well, there was that one time when there were [*literally* Episcopagans.](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/nov/01/20041101-122457-1902r/?page=)	24
1	Since he referred to the sinners as sick and in need of a doctor, I would say the accepting them and converting them was all wrapped into one.	24
1	[I miss the days when this blog updated.](http://badvestments.blogspot.com/) We need it now more than ever...	24
0	Well that's not what I meant even a little, and I've clarified now about four times. I'm getting pretty sick of it. If you'd like to peruse the replies to my comment, I've pointed out several times the huge difference between God specifically ordaining an exception to the murder rule and saying murder is just okay because lulz. I'm not engaging this anymore if people aren't going to read the whole conversation.	24
0	Just as long as you know there's a line that divides your right from others.   I'm sure you wouldn't support a Salafi Muslim's right to free exercise of religion by whipping unaccompanied women in the public square. That goes beyond the mere 'freedom to worship'.	24
1	The church has shifted on other social issues such as slavery, why would they not shift on abortion or same-sex marriage?	24
1	That in an of itself is not a good enough reason, but everybody dies, and God is allowed shut down entire nations. On top of that, he is able to place people in every nation and time period, who will deserve the final outcome.  I say that cautiously. I don't want to think backwards, and conclude that everybody deserves what he gets. I'm just saying that it is all possible.	24
0	Not looking for a  sign, nor making a statement about the 7500 dead. (looks like you haven't been paying attention) The point is, an incredible synchronicity took place.  That's significant if anything.	24
0	Hand them a Lee Strobel book, of course.	24
1	My thoughts exactly.  It's like no matter how bad it sounds, it somehow has to be for a good reason.	24
0	&gt;Most commoners back in the day were farmers. Marriage as a business deal combined two families resources, they probably did it alot.  You're speculating a lot more than I'm willing too, I am suspicious of your claim that most commoners owned farms.  &gt;In addition, you seem to be against divorce. You would have two people who dont love each other stay married?  Love is a choice and an action not an emotion. I choose to love my wife daily.	24

0	&gt; Hitler was not an atheist.  Well, that is a [huge discussion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Adolf_Hitler).   &gt;  Atheism is not a religion.  Well, some say it is - and some say it isn't. The word atheism comes from 'a' (not) theism (religious). Or something like that. But it is still a belief or lack of belief (there is no God or belief in something else) or lack of belief (I don't want to belief there is or isn't a God).	24

1	The picture is super interesting! The priests also wear vestments to distort their human figure-that way, we're focused more on the service, worship, and Sacraments, rather than the dude standing up there.	24
0	Giving an invitation is just fine. But why make people suffer?	24
1	FIrst, stop proof texting.  That'll get you into trouble whether you're a Christian or not.  Go and read the next verse of Ezek33.  And the first verses of 2Peter2 (who is "they"?) And what does repentance mean?  Go check out [luke 15 nrsv].	24
1	You dont have to be a Christian to go to church! Everybody's welcome to come check things out. I know we'd think it was pretty cool of you to visit our church even if its just a cultural experience or just because you were curious.	24
1	They were created without sin, which means there was no separation between them and God. What that means is not something we are capable of understanding as it is entirely outside of our experience.	24
0	If you look at my flair you'll see an atheist. The way you asked seemed like you were curious on what religion I was before I became an atheist so that is why I answered how I did.   Now the way you've worded things has made me wonder. Are you some type of theist?	24
1	Really? I dont see that anywhere here-can you quote where youve said that to me?	24
0	They always come up with something like this, because it's the only possible "answer". Kind of questionable if that would classify as a good deed though. From the point of view of an atheist it's kind of pointless to worship something that does not exist.	24
1	Ohh! Yeah, I agree with that, in the sense of "being a member of the Orthodox Church". I just meant being a member of the community. That's my fault, I probably should have worded it better.	24

0	Hobby Lobby has deeply held religious beliefs as they so often tell us.  They say they are even willing to shut down all their stores to honor their beliefs.  They buy a lot of goods from China so all I can assume is that the link above is an indirect attack on Hobby Lobby by the secular progressive left who hats Hobby Lobby.	24
1	yeah, the day fox news is actually "fair and balanced" is the day I may actually watch them.	24
0	It doesn't grind my gears but it makes me cringe because they're not being logical about their atheism.  If you truly believe that there is no god and that the universe is a product of chance then there is no meaning in life and no ultimate source of right and wrong and everything is subjective.  What you end up with is, as Richard Dawkins says, "everyone dancing to their DNA."  Morality is a non-factor in true atheism and very few people travel down that road because deep down their consciences attest to them that there is an over-arching moral law to the universe, just as Romans 1 states.	24
0	No one is innocent. (Romans 3:10-12)  He doesn't kill innocent people since innocent people don't exist, however He does kill wicked people.

0	There is a history of people claiming it, yes. All people benefiting from it.	24
0	Oh... :( Whoops.  You guys always seem so cordial with each other... I guess you two know how to keep from airing your dirty laundry to the public.  I'm glad that things are looking up for you two then? [seeing as how you're now responding to each other].  Before you mentioned this, I wouldn't have imagined you two getting in a spat on much besides... hm... mathematical platonism?  But don't take that as me trying to get into your family business; although, I am curious if that was what you were disagreeing about (if this "huge fight" wasn't imaginary, of course).	24
0	&gt;And if it really is just procreation, and adoption does not count, then are those who adopt somehow lesser families that are not worthy of being held together by marriage?  I don't see why not.  As I said, it is based on the ability of the sex act to be procreative without defects (age, infertility etc.) preventing it.	24
1	Funny thing is, Goan Christians *hate* the evangelists too. Older Christian sects in India hate the new breed of evangelism from America/Australia. They agree with the Hindus that the missionaries are spreading toxic agenda to 'save souls'.   Indian Christians are known for their liberal forward thinking among Indians. However, with this new breed, evangelical Christian organisations are pressurizing on things like "homosexuality is evil; don't go to doctors, Jesus will save you; don't abort". Same crap they do in America and Australia.  Whenever criticized, they spread propaganda with false facts and manufacture outrage.	24

0	1. How is it done then? People need to get the message that certain things are wrong. People who do something wrong go to jail and perhaps get it and do it again. Once a person decides to murder, he in my opinion is always will be a threat since he had that thought unless he becomes a Christian.   3. They didn't kill them. Perhaps the girls would've loved to be with the Jews since they didn't prostitute, rape, or sacrifice them.	24

0	&gt;Explain your reasoning because it just sounds like idiotic rambling at the moment.  Homosexuality, murder, theft, incest, and bestiality are all outlawed in the bible... if you reject the idea that homosexuality is wrong, why do you accept that the rest are indeed wrong?	24

1	Paladin - a medieval Christian knight of Charlamagne's court and defender of the faith.  My wife went to Furman University, who's sports teams are named the Paladins. So for those of you keeping score at home, that would be the Furman University Christian Knights.  Always fun to spell out at football games.	24

1	You may think they are in error, but they are still Christians. That is, a great many of Christians don't believe that homosexuality is a sin, so your response to /u/dolphins3 doesn't really make sense.	24

0	I know this may make me sound silly, but I learned about things like binatarianism and different councils that discussed different theologies. I also learned about an evolutionary pattern from the earliest gospel which isn't Matthew but Mark lol.   Why was there so much controversy or different views if the apostles taught the same idea? Why wasn't there some ultimate authority such as the "Diadche" to maintain uniformity.  Of course sweetheart I don't want you to do my paper, but can you outline like the main different views and which apostle each of the views can be traced back to, just an outline. Thanks!	24

0	Well from popular opinon on here, it seems to have biological merits.	24
1	I can guy that argument, but then your second one;  &gt;It is accurate to say God kills people in the same way it is accurate to say He births people, in that all deaths and births happen on His say so.  If that is the case then the abortionist acts at God's command do they not? It can't be both ways, either god wills the abortions, or all deaths *don't* happen on his say so.	24
0	&gt; the focal point should be the Eucharist and not a sermon or pastor.  I thought the focal point should be on making the world a better place through acts of love and service. The Eucharist is noble but by no means should it be the central theme of a Christians acts of service.	24

I did an exhaustive study on the material and [wrote a blog series on the topic](http://fatherlearningtolove.blogspot.com/2014/04/satan-lifting-veil-part-1-introduction.html).  It's actually quite fascinating material once you start playing detective with it.	24
0	Didn't Jesus teach us to beware false prophets?  Maybe these are good questions to ask?  There's clearly a dialogue here than can stem from this question that maybe we could both learn from. Would that be so bad??	24

0	This is Catholics and Lutherans together making a joint statement of faith, people who dont know much about Christianity often think it's just a vague collection of denominations that hate and completely disagree with each other.

0	You certainly can believe that brother, but I don't. Oh I'll concede people can still be "born that way," but it's not because of their genes. God doesn't program people to desire sodomy. God is not the author of confusion, He doesn't make someone feel a certain way and then condemn them for it. Jesus frees from it, but it's more than just prayer. It requires much more.  Unclean spirits are not above inhabiting children, or even the unborn. Unfortunately that freaks most people out so I generally avoid talking about it.	24

0	Despite all the other attempts below, the real answer is: no. No one can explain it to you on a simple level. The best way I heard it put back when I was anglo-catholic was that the only reason Anglicanism as a thing hasn't collapsed entitely is that it is so screwed up and complicated no one actually understands the situation. Which pretty much matched my experiences on the ground. Everything has splintered a million different ways for a million different reasons and nobody has a good picture of what or why or who.	24

Or what if I want a National Leave Your Religion Day? I don't want any of those things, because it's the government promoting religion, and the same is true for national prayer day.	24
0	They're arguing past each other.  The FRC claim is that male-male pedophiles are a subcategory of homosexuals. UC Davis disagrees, but seems to simply assert the point, before going on to "debunk" several sources, which were never intended to make the point they are refuting. The FRC listed a couple studies that they claimed indicate that male-male pedophiles tend to also be homosexual, which weren't mentioned at all in the UC Davis summary (that I could find.)  Regardless, UC Davis did a poor job here, since they ignored the actual point in contention and jumped ahead.	24

1	Rahab, the prostitute from Judges, is an ancestor of Jesus. Probably not that obscure for most but I only learned about it in the past couple of years. In the genealogy of Luke only Rahab's husband, Salmon, is mentioned.	24
1	&gt; God designed sex as a complementary heterosexual act, but self-stimulated sex is a personal homosexual act.  This one seems desperate. I mean they all do, but this one especially. When people try to legitimately say things that seemed like good insults at 14 before they realized they were bad, its probably pretty dubious.	24
1	Because he was a life-long faithful man, who preached the Gospel to people wide and far through his music, and was always thankful to God. Here, [check out this song by him and Buddy Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emyt-agLE_s)	24
0	My position is that your argument is not cogent.	24
1	&gt;/r/Atheism, it's full of insults being thrown at the religious.  You will have to forgive them.   Many feel they have been lied to. Many have been persecuted for their lack of faith. Many see religion as a lie, that twists public policy and seriously harms the world.   If I was an Atheist I'd be angry too.	24
0	Because it became harder and harder to kill off those who strayed into heresy.	24
1	Some (maybe even most) of the greatest Saints were single. Single doesn't mean "dying/living alone". When it is best lived out, it's meant to be pursuing celibacy for the sake of Christ. Many Saints didn't wish to be married because of how that might have turned their attention to things not of God (St Paul for instance was a supporter of this).	24
1	I was waiting for that one haha	24
0	&gt;I wouldn't frame it in the condemnatory language of 'jwfacts', which is basically an attack site against us witnesses,  Seriously? an "attack site"? Is that what you have been told to believe? I wasn't aware that exposing heresies or misdeeds of the WT was an attack..	24
1	Me too. B.B. King inspired me to pick up guitar. He's the *reason* I've been playing for the last decade, and he's always been an incredibly faithful man. [Here's one of my favorite tracks of his, which seems oddly appropriate right now...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emyt-agLE_s)  To quote him &amp; Buddy Guy "I thank the Lord for letting me stay around a little longer....

0	Which people become obese without overeating?  How many?  Very few.  Christianity must take a stand against this epidemic of gluttony.  God does not love ugly.	24

0	&gt; but appealing to nature isn't going to win anyone over to our side. The killing of partners and offspring is found in many species, but we don't let that fly for humans.  Why don't we let that fly as humans? Could it be that it's not in our nature? Or not in our more recent enlightened nature anyway.	24

0	The first duty of the government is "to bear the sword".  Today, we use guns and handcuffs, but the effect is the same.  Consider, if you do not pay your taxes, at some point men with guns will come and lock you up.  So, then - using tax money to "help the poor" is really holding a gun to someone's head and forcing them to give their money to someone else.  I don't think that is what Christianity is about...	24
1	The idea that smashing a child against the rocks is ever a moral thing to do is complete shit. Any on who defends such a statement is a psychopath. Anyone who claims the old testament no longer applies is copping out.  If God told me to murder a baby, I would defy a the will of God. I'll happily burn in hell before taking the life of an innocent child.	24
0	&gt;I'd argue a virtuous life is an enriched one (not necessarily a happy one)  Actually, doing acts of virtue (generosity, giving gifts etc) actually stimulates the reward centres of your brain, making you happy. At least for a time.	24

1	And in response, I can't get why people who believe that no one should be able to legally force people to act in a Christian manner can support banning gay marriage, which is legally forcing people to act in a Christian manner.	24
0	There is so much truth in the saying that “if God is all you have, then you have got all you need.” This is because if we allow God have full control of our lives, He will manifest His power in every area of our needs.	24

The fact that in reality its random stuff that wouldn't really it just an indication that the people at the time clearly didn't have a real divine mandate for what they were doing.

1	Sorry, the other poster was criticizing your post because, in their view, you're saying you only want a church that makes you feel comfortable - lets you do bad stuff and not feel bad about it. But in your post, you didn't say that, you said you don't like crowds and awkward social interaction.  And I get annoyed when people confuse the first one for the second one.	24

No, I understand it *too* well, that's why I don't believe it.	24

1	Without a sense of catholicism (unity), there is no need to go through the intense effort of establishing agreed upon doctrine when you can just join up with like-minded folks who believe just like you do. There is no one answer, historically, because each schism deals with different issues in different times in different contexts.	24

In fact the reverse is true.   - This is wrong accusation, "Christianity and Christian doctrine is not based on the Bible. In fact the reverse is true."  but let me ask you first before i attack you, if the christian doctrine is NOT based on the bible, where then we should based it? tradition? culture? inventions like rosary? purgatory? limbo? where?	24

1	&gt;335 In her liturgy, the Church joins with the angels to adore the thrice-holy God. She invokes their assistance (in the funeral liturgy's In Paradisum deducant te angeli. . .["May the angels lead you into Paradise. . ."]). Moreover, in the "Cherubic Hymn" of the Byzantine Liturgy, she celebrates the memory of certain angels more particularly (St. Michael, St. Gabriel, St. Raphael, **and the guardian angels**).	24

0	How does 'being like Jesus' constitute good advice concerning how to deal with humanitarian aid, foreign and internal policy, as well as how to behave?   People have been studying Jesus' sayings for the past 2,000 years and nobody can agree on exactly the same thing. Some people think Jesus wants peace and love, and others think Jesus wants us to give tax breaks to the rich and to invade foreign countries.  If God's only advice is to be like Jesus, then I don't think that god is particularly competent.	24
1	Right, and that's why the Oil companies' arguments of "Let's rape the Earth (for our profit), because Biblical" is so unnerving. As long as these companies support socially conservative candidates, the Religious Right goes along and even promotes the message.   I believe it was Mark Driscoll who infamously boasted that he drove an SUV and didn't care about pollution because Jesus was about to come back and destroy the planet anyway.	24
1	Actually, scientism means "the belief in the universal applicability of the scientific method and approach, and the view that empirical science constitutes the most authoritative worldview or most valuable part of human learning to the exclusion of other viewpoints."  Thus Quantum Mechanics is still science, because it is founded on empirical evidence.  Misapplication of Quantum Mechanics is not, because there is no evidence to back them up.	24

0	We must love through and in Truth. If the Truth can be manipulated then so can love. We can understand God now because he has come as the Son of God incarnate, the Living and Eternal Word. Because he has deified his body for us we can listen, understand, walk with, suffer with, etc with Him. He understood that even God can be misunderstood which is why he had 12 disciples. Those disciples eventually evangelized. Going back to my original question: What did they teach, what did their students and those who heard their words teach and so on?	24

0	That's not the same. They don't have two brides or two grooms. One person had to be "dominant" and the other "submissive". Now we consider men and women equal. There doesn't have to be a man and a woman in every wedding because neither are treated as property anymore.	24

1	Just to be clear, prayer is actually allowed in school. Government employees, however, are not allowed to endorse or promote any religion as it would be a violation of the separation of church and state.   Students can still pray on their own accord. They can still read the bible in school. They can still say a prayer before eating lunch. Students can still gather together for religious study.  You wouldn't know that based on Fox "News" deliberately spinning things.	24
1	&gt; However, when we get to heaven, we'll be completely sanctified and have the same desires as God, so him imposing his wrath on sinners will give us great joy   Does he have scriptural evidence that supports this? That sounds vaguely brainwashy.	24

1	I think people tend to underestimate what *eternity* means.  We live about 75-80 years.  That's a long time for us.  That's our whole lives.  But now consider 80 years compared to a thousand.  Already seems insignificant.  Now consider 80 years compared to fucking *eternity*.  That's literally an unlimited amount of lifetimes.  I don't think even Hitler deserves that shit. And this asswipe says his son deserves *that* for **TWO YEARS** of being a little jealous?  This is why.  This is why people become atheists.	24

0	You consider it heresy, but not everyone sees authority in the official list of heresies and there's a wide range of opinions regarding icons throughout the church at large. Almost every iconoclast who has posted in this thread has gotten a reply from you asserting the heresy ruling as the final say on the matter when I know you know that most iconoclasts aren't a part of the capital C Church.  Your stance and the Church's stance aren't the only stance, and "correcting" people who you know don't follow the Church's authority by pointing to Church rulings is passive aggressive at best.	24

I've never had another Christian tell me I'm a fake Christian because of what I believe. I've never had that problem. It's almost as if the dichotomy isn't as stable as you believe it to be. I've had Christians *disagree* with me, but to call me a fake? Never had that problem.  I wonder why that is.	24

1	Jesus rose on a Sunday. Therefore, the Apostles started celebrating on Sundays. Therefore, the commandment about the Sabbath is typically treated as referring to the Lord's Day (Sunday) when seen in a Christian light.	24
1	Tiridates III of Armenia proclaimed Christianity as the state religion of his kingdom a full 12 years before Constantine even officially legalized Christianity, and Rome didn't follow suit until Theodosius I, decades after Constantine was dead. There were plenty of Christians hanging out in or near positions of power before him (Most famously St. George, an army officer martyred by Diocletian); the latter fact is a large part of what convinced Diocletian to launch his persecution in the first place. It's not as if Christians had never thought of being politically active prior to Constantine giving them the idea, they just weren't numerous or secure enough to actually do it.	24
0	Looks like my warning was too late for you. God is not a personal experience. He is an infinite and eternal being beyond our ability to understand. your personal experience is a tiny glimpse into that greater reality. You have to put your experience into context with other peoples experiences if you want to understand God better. For that we have the Bible.	24

0	What about black churches?  Are they an exception to this rule?   And I don't think Christians are really the power majority we are made out to be - we lost the evolution issue, we lost the gay marriage issue, we lost abortion, we lost just about every big issue we brought to the table, suggesting we may not be quite as powerful as people make us out to be.    Also I don't think it's fair to say that a good democarcy only protects minority religions, the orthodox church was the majority religion in Russia but it would be crazy to characterize what happened to them under communism as anything other than persecution.	24

0	&gt;11 A woman[a] should learn in quietness and full submission. 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man;[b] she must be quiet. 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 14 And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. 15 But women[c] will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. (1 Timothy 2)  I think it's pretty clear who's doing the submitting.	24
1	If a church claims to be "welcoming" of gay people, then it should be somewhere where a gay couple and their children can say, "This would be a good church for our family." I don't think that's going to be the case here. Although I think being LGBT and Christian are perfectly compatible, I'm not going to demand churches that disagree change their view. But I wish they would stop misappropriating the word "welcome."	24

1	Be sure the Orthodox church is canonical. Wouldn't want to wander into some old calendar sect.  Rule of thumb is avoid churches with True, Genuine, or Holy in the name.  Also might want to go OCA or Antiochean, cause those usually have a better chance of being in English.	24

0	Glad I read this, thanks for posting!  Man, this is a tough topic.  I'm certainly convicted, because I know that my abhorring the sin and the modern culture's celebration of it is constantly blinding me to the sin of failing to respect people's dignity, and God's love for them.  God's law is being attacked tooth-and-nail, and, worst of all, Christ is being flayed again by the liberal churches that say sin is not sin, and I want to grab a sword like Peter.  And in that desire I hear the challenging radicalism of Christ to put it away.	24
1	Nope, not at all. Many people look up to Jesus due to the examples of compassion, understanding, and love set by him. You may not have the same perception of him as other people but that does not mean that you cannot learn from the example that he set.	24
0	I am not sure your indirect attacks on Hobby Lobby will be that well taken in this sub...	24
1	Sorry, that makes a lot more sense. When we accept someone as a member, its a process that means baptism and being voted in by the congregation (I know, very strange).	24
1	I feel that, in keeping with the canons of the 7th Ecumenical Council, they're advocating for proper Christology.  Christ is fully human and therefore quite depictable.  While Christ is in Heaven at the moment, He did have an earthly, material existence, and that's *incredibly* important.    Saying that it's wrong to depict Christ or the saints is heresy.  (That said, it *is* patently inappropriate to depict God the Father, who has never assumed physical form.)	24

1	Around where I went to high school in California, rosaries *were* a sign of gang activity, plain and simple. It was physically dangerous to wear rosary beads around the neck like a necklace. Some kids in middle school might be trying to be "cool" like their high school-aged siblings, neighbors, etc without knowing the implications and/or consequences of their dress. You could be hurt or even shot for walking around in the wrong parts of town for wearing the wrong color beads. I support the ban. It's sort of sad that it's come to this, but children's safety is at stake.	24
1	Strange and unproductive? Anti-vaxxers are among the most credulous and ill-informed of fringe group yahoos. They literally believe vaccines cause autism in spite of there being absolutely no credible medical evidence of this whatsoever. The religious ones harbor the most bizarre misinterpretations of Scripture this side of the British Israel movement.   It's like talking to people who believe in evil government chemtrails.	24

0	You're assuming that God made people that way.   Are you also saying that God made people full of hate, lust, etc. that he made them blind, deaf, sick etc?   We're living in a fallen world with a lot of things that aren't as God originally made them... So why do you assume that Homosexuality is something God intended?	24
1	What is a true Christian? What is a false Christian?	24
0	&gt;Same-sex attraction is not a choice just like opposite sex attraction is not a choice.   I have to disagree with this one.  For me, it is every bit a choice, even subconsciously, that was shaped by our surroundings.  We choose that which is laid before us.  Our nurturing tends to steer our nature more than what we would like to believe so.  The way I address this is that I say it's usually more complicated than that.  But, overall I agree with the post.	24
0	Justice is a "just fair or treatment." So murdering someone...well, killing not murdering them is justice and mercy to everyone else in my opinion. That's being fair with the victim's family. Put yourself in the same situation and perhaps now you can't think of it really but if it does happen, you will want that kind of justice to be done. Being locked up and given food, shelter, clothing, among perhaps other things is not that bad.	24
1	I think you are mischaracterizing r/atheism. It's really not that bad at all! Certainly not like it was years ago when they dropped it from the default list. It's come a long way. Now and then a believer will pop in and ask some earnest questions and they are treated with sincere respect.	24

1	Its a compulsion thing. No matter how much you drink it will never be enough. You want the feeling of being drunk and numb, and you want it to be even better than the last time. You're afraid the feeling will go away if you don't keep drinking.  I used to get off work and fill a big soda fountain cup (52oz) with box wine and drink it all and chase it with beers till I passed out.	24
0	&gt; The fact that the owners of the business are ordained ministers has nothing to do with it.   In the eyes of the law they do some paperwork for you and then perform some theatre with audience participation.	24

1	&gt; My initial reaction to it is that it's very fortunate for baby 2 that he guessed everything exactly right with no way of knowing.  The story was kind of constructed to make baby 2 the "reasonable one" of the two, since of course Mother "intervenes" in the womb in a much more obvious way than God intervenes in our world, with the voice and all that, but I get your point.  Thank you for your perspective.	24

0	To put it simply, I don't *care* that you think I'm incorrect because you'd think that about anything I posted that suggested this teaching was fallible.  Similarly, I'm not going to put in the effort to look into where exactly the Church is in error regarding marriage, since not even the Church is willing to do so.	24

I think the honorable thing for our species to do is to deny our programming.

0	How did this pro-homosexuality post by a non-Christian get 119 upvotes when most submissions to this sub have less than 20? Makes you think.  Meanwhile, homosexual acts are still a sin, homosexual marriage is still invalid, and "gay" is still a co-opted word by homosexuals which properly means "happy."	24
1	Gay people are sinners and going to hell? Isn't that the primary message?	24

0	Ah, but now it's a race to see whether I correctly understand it before I correctly understand Orthodox theology. They tend to be arrogant jackasses less often, though, so it's not looking good for the Original Church here :(	24

0	Your knowledge of facts is impressive. Your ability to sort, categorize, and draw conclusions from them needs a significant amount of work. Most people tend to have either a better memory or a better analytical mind. I think you might have been gifted with the former.  Anyone who walks away from a serious study of Church history with "I really respect some Protestant positions for their consistency with the early Church" has utterly failed in either the depth or breadth of their study.	24
1	That too, but I'm pretty sure he is referring to the [Rhineland Massacres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhineland_massacres). The call for the first crusade led to a lot of violence against jewish communities in France and Germany.	24

0	&gt; There is no witness of death and resurrection in that.  So what? That makes exactly zero difference to anything. A: just because some people believed X doesn't mean X is true, and B: why do you presume that this is a meaningful benchmark of validity? Is Sikhism, for example, necessarily invalid if it doesn't have a resurrection story? (I have no clue whether it does).  And on your last: what I am *against* is religions presuming (and leaning on privilege to assert) that the rules that apply to other people *do not apply to them*.	24
0	1st Timothy talks about forbidding marriage and Hebrews extols marriage (ofc, Paul's authorship of Hebrews is debateable, but even if he didn't write it, I know of no reason to assume that it was written by someone who would disagree with Paul).  The tone and the message are entirely different than with the Corinthian epistles, I assume, because in one he is writing to a brother in the faith and a student of his, and in the others, he is wary of adversaries in the faith.	24

1	So very similar to the same things said about women's rights, interracial marriage, and abolition. Those issues, like this one, has Christians on both sides. And all of those are accepted today. Most people could care less how churches or religions define marriages internally, outside of informed consent. What they do care about is when those definitions are moved to the civil law.	24

0	I am against alcohol for the things it does to people, to cultures and to nations. This isn't a religious thing to me, as much as logical thinking. How many destruction do you need to see from a product to figure out that it probably isn't a good thing?  Drinking booze is dumber than smoking tobacco. And few things on Earth are as dumb as smoking tobacco.	24
1	Jesus didn't change anything, but the idea behind the meme is that people today have changed what Jesus said to make him a more likable fellow. I'm guessing that his words about hating your mother and father, for instance, would be ones that people have changed a bit to better suit them.	24
0	I can't wait for the synod. Schism here we go.	24
1	Is it weird that I'm not a Christian but love Jesus?  That's why I come here.	24
1	Not at all. Fiction has given Christians a creative outlet since time immemorial. And frankly I think we need more Christians writing science fiction...too much of it presents a future where human religion has ceased to exist, or become so marginal as to be unworthy of mention. As a Christian reader, that always annoys me (and is unrealistic).	24

0	Well, that's the reason it lets them last longer, the penis is less sensitive. Yet you read from many people that had the procedure done with prior sexual experience that it's not that much of a loss that you lose every sensory input you have. Depending on the study, only 20% even report a decline in sensation.  Your text is all neurologically speaking and really can't be debated because it's true what you've written. But sex is way more than just that.	24
1	Well, not quite. Conservatives *do* give more to charity, but this is almost entirely explained by the fact that more conservatives are Christian. Conservative beliefs are not the driving factor.	24
0	Americans are too politically correct. I have gay friends and in my experience using the terms gay, "girl" (for a gay man), homo and even gay b*****d are used (as long as they're your friend).  We Australians don't have the hangups people in the US have.	24

0	Umm...well, I don't think that exactly counts. I honestly doubt they were really thinking about that back then really.   That thought of perhaps ignorance doesn't reflect on what they saw to be true in their eyes. Unless, you knew and saw something 100% as true you wouldn't be in their shoes and know it to be true. I'm not talking about terrorists because those Christians weren't terrorists.	24
0	Why can the society not base its definition of marriage on procreative capability?  If that is the definition, then there is no reason (even putting aside considerations of the morality of the acts involved itself) that same-sex couples should gain those benefits.	24

0	Thank you for that. However, I would argue this somewhat differently.  I would suggest that it a "Christian" was going around beating up gay people, they wouldn't actually be Christian. Christianity is a following of Christ, and a desire to live Christlike. If someone is doing these things, and not repenting of what they've done, I would say that they simply aren't Christian, though they may claim church membership.	24

1	"I'm like Bonhoeffer" strongly implies "You're like Hitler".  Godwin's Law, everybody, Godwin's Law.  But then, I'm trans, so apparently I *am* the enemy plotting genocidal murder of Christians (including myself? - not clear on that).	24
0	I meant agnostic as in the Holy Spirit being something real, while at the same time I believe it is described in other religions than Christianity such as chi or prana in eastern religions.  The word agnostic is perhaps not exactly correct, but it was the closest I could think of. In hindsight the word integral would probably have been better to use in the title.	24
1	It's basically equating LGBT with Satan, saying their demand for equal rights is the equivalent of Satan demanding powers equal to God. Which quickly false apart as a metaphor and seems rather blasphemous. As far as I know, it never happened in the bible. I know Satan tried to overthrow God.   Edit: I can imagine putting this sign in the perspective of the 1950s segregation.	24
0	Purity and porn are two sides of the same coin	24
0	&gt;I never said "logical ramifications," so I'm not sure who you're quoting.   A "logical ramification" is a "logical inference".  Ironically logic is required to make that inference.   &gt;Where is this explicitly in scripture?   Romans 8, which teaches about the logical inferences and ramifications of being justified in Christ and forgiven by God.	24
1	Or the marginalised. However, I do agree with you, talking about what you *dont* believe is not likely to end in productive conversation.	24

I don't see anything at all wrong with poking fun at absurd beliefs other people hold, or seriously discussing the dire consequences of those beliefs, when you aren't directly trying to offend someone by brigading their sub or responding to people personally. If people are just laughing (or critiquing) amongst themselves about a shared belief system or value or lack thereof, who is offended? How is that a problem?	24

1	Given this person's posting history, I'm going to go on a limb and say he thinks that if America legalizes gay marriage, soon we'll legalize polygamy, and then we'll legalize beastiality, and then pretty soon we've got 400,000 people married to warm bagels.	24

1	Don't debate her, that will not accomplish anything positive.  If she wants to honour God that way, then that is a good thing.  It would probably harm her conscience if she didn't.  Conversely she should not judge others who do not see it her way.	24
0	Didn't Jesus dress as those in the surrounding culture dressed?  I'm more inclined in that direction.  Not knocking that this system in its symbology isn't interesting, but not what I want from my religious leaders.  I want them to stand out not because of what they wear, but how they are leading the way.  If I walk into a room, I don't want to know which man or woman is clergy just by looking around at their attire, I'd much rather learn it by how they conduct themselves.	24
1	what's the propaganda?  it is not saying that anyone needs to believe that homosexuality is not a sin, it is just an article trying to help everyone speak in ways that love and build up others.	24
1	There are real dangers and risks to sex. There are real moral problems associated with sex. But the average age of marriage in the United States is 28. Leaving people in the dark about sex until they're nearly 30 is absurd.	24
1	&gt; shoddy science  The irony is delicious  &gt; ALL homosexuals  It is sufficient to claim that some or many had no choice.  &gt; identity crisis.   If somebody wants to get with the same sex solely because they're having an identity crisis, they're not gay. If they actually are attracted to the same sex, they're gay. How is this relevant?	24
1	Fun fact: when I was on Mount Athos, I was able to follow the services quite easily despite knowing only a few shreds of Greek.  The number one reason this was possible was because I could count the Kyrie Eleisons and know what was happening.  Well, that, knowing a smidgen of the Trisagion, the Lord's Prayer, and the melodies to a few of the hymns (O Gladsome Light's Byzantine melody fits with any translation, ranging from the GOA's abomination to the Liturgical Texan of the OCA-DOS version).	24

0	He doesn't have to argue from a position of power to represent something that is common to the human race, and power can derive from strength in numbers, which is how a tyranny of a majority operates.

God's Word is truth. Tradition's of men change, but God stays the same. We must root ourselves in scripture.	24

1	You have to admit that y'all aren't the most hospitable to the GSM homeless population.  Which means you're pretty harsh on a *very large* part of the homeless population under 25.	24
0	No, The answer would only depend on what's in the bible, the rest would be false teachings.	24
1	He told the apostles about it after the Resurrection.	24
0	well, he can say he's a woman but that don't make him one right? This only makes souls to not even consider Christianity when searching God, and so they search answers on Buddhism or another religions.	24
1	This article would have been sweet like 20 years ago.  Now, it's like "well, duh".	24
1	Vestments are not an elevating of the priests above the congregation. They are priestly garb which shows their role in the church and their service to both God and their fellow man.   Compare that to some mega church situations where the pastor might dress like everyone else, but he's an almost cult leader type person. The service is all about the sermon, and the church is all about him. That's why some of these never survive a pastor change.	24
0	You will still end up believing both the qu'ran and the bible.	24
0	I'm all for egalitarianism, but the reality of academia (at least as I preceive it) is that it is a vertical society.	24
1	I'm sorry to hear that, bro. It's been four 1/2 years since I discovered my wife's infidelity and that long since I've see my daughter. It still hurts and there's not a day that goes by that I don't think about it. But It gets more manageable, slowly. I wish there was something I could say to make it less painful for you. Just know that you aren't alone and there are people who care about you.  Hang in there, man.	24
0	&gt;I can logically justify any of my morals.  Should a person be unselfish? If so, why?  &gt;I'm not saying that everything needs to be logically justified.  If something is illogical or unreasonable, surely it's just a superstition, isn't it? Aren't we _all_ better off without superstition in our lives?	24
1	Amen. Its beautiful you can see this. God bless you	24

0	Then why are the teachings of Lutherans (a 500 year old church) different than the teachings of the Orthodox Church (a 2000 year old church)	24

1	You're reading the statement entirely wrong if you think it's a condemnation of religion. It's a condemnation of people who claim all atheists are inherently immoral or amoral.	24
0	I have no doubt at all that Bonhoeffer would have publicly convicted the wild and false accusations of the religious right against gays.  He would have publicly convicted and challenged the Christian activists who are bearing false witness against gays in their public statements.  At no point in my comments have I suggested that Bonhoeffer would have endorsed gay marriage.  I am addressing myself to the vile public utterances of those claiming him for their talisman.  Have you seen what they have been claiming over the last three weeks?  Where are the honest Christian ministers to call them on this false witness, and to pronounce to the community that Christianity does not accord itself with this bigotry and violence?	24
1	Ugh, your insistence on vestments that don't look like childrens' art projects is the main impediment to Episcopal-Orthodox rapprochement.	24
1	I will defend the offensive because we *need* to be reminded of the shocking.  We need to confront the world as it is, not as we want it to be.  We need to remember that the world as we know it is fallen and that we *should* be fundamentally offended by that fact.  There is a large current in American Christianity in particular that wants to run from difficulty, from horror, from things that upset us.  We need to confront those things instead of hiding them and hiding from them.  We need to avoid living in a bubble of self-deluded comfort.	24
1	Only a small minority of humans will be saved. The rest will spend eternity in hell because they either never heard the Gospel, or they heard it and rejected it.  That's what I was taught as a child raised in church.  Of course, I think that's BS now.	24
0	Have you seen a miracle with your own eyes? Do you trust the words of some man 2000 years ago, over your own eyes?	24
1	Yes, children don't generally become parents. People who have spent ten years on something are generally speaking more than ten years old.  Excellent deduction.	24
0	Incorrect. However, those verses are heavily debated here. Many, including myself, do not see them as anti-lgbt.	24
0	&gt;There aren't waiting periods for any other medical procedure.  That's not true.  &gt;Women are adults who can make their own choices and deal with the consequences.  And so are gun owners. Still, there's a waiting period for that.	24
1	I think it belongs in this sub.  The current Chinese government has a history of attacking Christians too	24
0	It harms your neighbour atheists. That should be enough.	24
1	He did something similar in [2 Cor 4:8], the jars of clay passage. When he said *"perplexed but not in despair"* in the original Greek, what reads is *"apouromensis nil exapouromensis"*. The first term means to be at a loss of answers, while the second term is an exaggeration of the first, being at **such** a loss that you believe there can never be any answers. That's some wordplay there.	24
1	I'm curious why he concluded it was God, though. Regardless of what he promised God, if I were the Evil One, I think it might amuse me to put people in positions they weren't ready for.  Doctors who should have failed chemistry. Engineers who should have failed math. Housecleaners who mix bleach with ammonia. It begins!	24
1	A great many of Christians don't believe that homosexuality is a sin.	24
0	You're missing the point: funding NASA forces people to fund others to fly into orbit. It's still using the threat of violence to get other people to do what you want. And because NASA has a near-monopoly on space flight (a total monopoly in the US until recently), people just assume that there's no better way to do it, just like they assume there can be no large-scale social safety net unless it is operated by the world's largest armed faction. Which is a strange assumption for a follower of the Prince of Peace to make.	24

0	Evolution (as in molecules to man) can be killed, **dead**, with two facts.  1. Life does not come from non-life. 1. There is no known process by which an organism can increase its genetic information. Natural selection reduces the genetic variation of organisms.	24
1	Want millennials in the pews? Be kind.	24
0	A mortal sin you say. First of all where does the idea of a mortal sin even come from (which thinkers were responsible for categorization and why?), how long after Christ did the concept develop, how did the penalties become arbitrarily established, and why should I believe this alleged sin deserves such theological condemnation?	24
0	So your argument is that god is an asshole, deal with it?	24

1	Hitler, as I'm sure others have pointed out, was Christian. Catholic to be precise. Whether he sincerely believed or merely used Christianity as a vehicle for murder and destruction is debatable, but there is no point at which he professed a lack of belief in a deity.	24
1	Thank you for standing up for what is right.	24
1	Beautiful, well said. We are but nothing, as you said, we are but a "smudge of carbon on a rock in orbit around a main-sequence star in a galaxy that [we] can't even begin to comprehend". And yet this is the shape our God took. That which is higher yearned for that which is lower. And this is the greatest mystery of joy for man.	24
0	No you are spot on.  The word "Biblical" has absolutely no meaning. It's just a word that means "me right you wrong."  I got the "I'll pray for you / Fuck you" after I went all angry socrates on a dispensationalist who seemed confused about the burden of proof a few weeks back in this same message board.	24

1	&gt; "stupid atheists trying to burn the country down"  ... aha... much becomes clear.  Yeah, *that* kind of Christian is not going to make Jesus' presence very evident.  Er, forgive me for speaking disrespectfully about your parents?  I'm sure they're nice people otherwise?	24

1	A giant red letter. Like maybe a red A, since it's the first letter of the alphabet.	24
0	The East has never had to deal with translation issues because Greek is the native tongue of the Orthodox Church.  It has long been clear to us that the verse and others like it refer to sex acts between men.  Furthermore, the Orthodox Church (including Rome at the time) is the one that compiled the canon of Scripture based on consistency with our pre-existing faith.	24
1	I served deviled eggs at Easter...I'm a monster.	24
0	You drew a false assumption from my comment. It is because I know that the pope has the holy spirit that I know I can change his mind.	24
0	First lets clarify a key point. That is that attraction is NOT action. ALL sexual relations involving humans involves a choice by at least 1. We as a society has to decide whether or not we want to sanction this behavior. Gay Marriage at it's core involves behavior and a choice no matter how the gay community wants to spin the issue.   We are not talking about the same rights as African Americans or any other group. We are talking about sanctioning and calling "normal" a particular pattern of behavior.	24
1	Stephen Fry does not say that a god cannot exist because there is suffering. His point follows the problem of evil:   Is god willing to prevent suffering, but unable? Then god is not omnipotent.   Is god able to prevent suffering, but not willing? Then god is malevolent.   Is god willing and able to prevent suffering? Then why is there suffering?   Is god neither willing nor able to prevent suffering? Then why call him god?	24
0	The propaganda cycle continues on this sub.	24
1	I thought it was worth pointing out that you had nearly doubled the number you were quoting. Most people wouldn't do that unless they thought the number mattered.	24
0	The way the pastor said it is kind of dickish but it never ceases to amaze me how much of an emotional backlash someone like him can generate. I would've just moved on with my life personally.  In fact, I find it hard to believe they cared about the pastor or what he said; I suspect they just used him as excuse to be lewd and to be anti-religion (see the church comment) under the disguise of a noble cause (which made me chuckle especially when they said they were saving lives LOL).	24
0	Those verses just say he is the God of the living. He absolutely is, but everyone dies an earthly death. This refers to everyone being alive, but in a spiritual way. They are still physically dead.	24
0	Are we supposed to apologize for the authenticity of our faith? Should we accommodate the pagan errors of Protestant belief? I grew up in Protestant denominations with this false concept of an invisible Church unity and tolerance of beliefs I disagreed with, but the truth is the truth. I'm not going to water it down just to make someone feel more comfortable. If you show up at my parish, you will be welcomed with open arms, but no one will accommodate heresy. Christianity is not an opinion poll, it's the death and resurrection of Christ.	24
0	I don't get it. You've got a generous heart when it comes to people's physical needs, but then this "pull yourself up by your own bootstraps" mentality when it comes to their spiritual needs. Why the disconnect? If people sometimes need help with feeding their physical body, do they not also sometimes need help with their spiritual body?	24
0	Well at least you're being honest. That's a good sign.	24
0	if you don't speak in a tongues you do not have Holy Spirit.  Paul by the way was talking about tongues in a church. Worshipping in tongues is one of the best ways to get to know our Father. Everyone baptized in the Holy Spirit spoke in tongues in the day of Pentecost.	24
1	Isn't this just passive aggressively asserting the holier-than-thou rhetoric that it is denouncing?	24
0	Are you implying that Jesus doesn't share sexual moments with the church?	24
0	Me neither. I think there's something oddly...narcissistic about a good, fortunate thing happening in a Christian's life, making them believe that God intervened, bestowing a miracle upon them, because it completely ignores the suffering and torment endured by millions all across the globe. You'd essentially have to believe that there is something special about you, and that you deserve special treatment over other human beings who arguably need miracles much more.	24
0	In my experience, if people didn't think their beliefs were right, they probably wouldn't be practicing them. By practicing those beliefs, there's the inherent thinking that they're correct in it.	24
1	Seeing your flair, if we were sitting together and someone asked us the role of the Bishop of Rome, you and I would have different answers and would be able to back up those answers. So you think you are right and I think I am right, we now have two different denominations... and we're not even to the reformation.	24
1	I would get a paternity test on your kids as well..unless they look like you. But sorry your wife has been unfaithful. *hugs* you are in my thoughts.	24
1	hmm not really... plenty of conceptions of God which don't include omnibenevolence as part of the definition.	24

0	The term has long been understood in the East (where the Greek original of the NT originated) to mean sex acts between men.  "Homosexuality" may not be as precise a term as "αρσενοκοιταις" but for conveying the meaning and the sense, adequate.  Example in the classic [Rudder](http://www.holytrinitymission.org/books/english/canons_fathers_rudder.htm), canon 18 of St. John the Faster.  Search the text for "arseno" which should locate the various transcriptions of αρσενοκοιταις.	24
0	But the problem with that assumption is that it is not compatible with Paul's theology elsewhere.  So either he had a change of mind, didn't really think things through, or something else.  Given that he states in one epistle "I speak as a fool" there's reason to suspect he's not always entirely straight-forward.	24
1	I cannot speak for the Adventist Church but as far as the church in general, its job is to teach the Gospel to all nations. NOT try to squeeze current events into symbolic book written about events in 70AD.	24
0	Gays can already get married just as much as anyone else can. The problem is when they want to pretend *a completely different relationship* is marriage. And to make it worse, that relationship (sodomy) is gravely sinful.  If gays asked for legal privileges *similar to those of marriage*, but without trying to taint the term "marriage", they'd get further. Even moreso if they advocated for those privileges equally for other non-sodomite relationships (eg, brother+sister, monks, nuns, non-sodomite same-sex flatmates, etc).	24
0	No that's not right. I wouldn't fault Muslim voters if they wanted to vote for what legal system they believe is correct. That doesn't mean I have to agree with their religious law.	24
0	I guess I don't mean portrayed in the Bible, but as it has been portrayed by sunday school teachers and media, etc.	24
0	Do you really need an overseer to make you treat others well? I'd argue that a true intellectual appreciation of working for the common good is more durable than one based on unproven supernatural suppositions.	24

1	Sadly it is porn.  I'm way better than I was a few years ago, but have not been able to stop 100%.	24
0	Is that sort of intimacy only achievable via sex?	24
0	As I said, the state doesn't need to justify its exclusion of same-sex couples under rational basis review.  All they need is an interest rationally related to the current classification.  Since sexual orientation is not normally read into in the 14th Amendment, their exclusion doesn't place them into any higher degrees of legal scrutiny requiring a reason for exclusion.  Further, the belief (and, as the Supreme Court ruled, the evidence or lack thereof to support such a belief is irrelevant.  No legal debate can be had about the actual truth of this statement under rational basis review) that opposite sex couples make better parents also satisfies rational basis review.	24

0	well to be fair here, Christian deists such as yourself don't really believe that Christ was divine so wouldn't really consider his words here a prophecy that must come true.  You think its some kind of nice philosophy he was talking about or something.  So I donno, I wish youd post some disclaimer when explaining scripture or what Jesus said .	24

No. They are simply recognizing a christian event going on in their community.	24

0	/Yes, you can because a person's faith is what saves them./  - what faith saves people? faith alone? or holy faith?   you see, holy faith IS NOT faith alone, because holy faith is with work. When you say faith alone, it does not include work, dont you know the meaning of faith alone?	24
1	And you act as if the Holy Spirit didn't guide those Ecumenical Councils. It doesn't matter if people tried to force them one way or the other- they're guaranteed by the Holy Spirit. It's like humans in the Church- we can sin and do awful things and try to move the Church in one way or the other, but the Holy Spirit still guarantees the doctrine and dogma according to Matthew 16.	24

0	Glad you found it interesting.   That line from Corinthians resonated with me when I decided that faith wasn't for me. I felt like someone writing or translating the bible had inserted it as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the bible being useful for social control but fundamentally unseemly for an educated adult to believe.	24

1	Want Millennials back in the pews? Stop trying to make church 'cool' using rock music, and start trying to make it cool by changing your doctrine in accordance with the latest zeitgeist.

1	God hasn't declared that we should abort anyone. We decided to do that for our own convenience. One special circumstance where God instructed the deaths of a group of children doesn't exonerate all infanticide committed by anyone ever.	24
0	I disagree. The Church, which I'll asume means any organized Christian denomination(correct me if I'm wrong), has fucked up a lot. I feel that if God is real, then he wouldn't like religions being essentially poltical bodies.	24

0	&gt;no longer Christian/no longer shared your beliefs?   This is actually two different things. I am a Christian but I no longer hold the overly Protestant views of my parents and family.  If my kids told me they were no longer Christian I can only do two things 1) pray for them, and 2) do some soul searching about where I failed them as a parent.	24

0	&gt;However, if there were a group of people who put out a pamphlet saying 'if a candidate is a Christian then *don't vote for him*' we'd have another Todd Starnes fueled Christian Persecution fest.

0	"but test everything; hold fast what is good." 1 Thess 5:21  Always challenge every notion like that against Scripture. If it's not in there, can it. Adding to Scripture is as much a sin as throwing some out.   For instance, IIRC there are 4 references in the NT about dress, and everyone of them promotes modesty and not being flashy. Putting on your best expensive suit for church is the opposite of what the Bible teaches.	24

Gee, I wonder, surely it can't be the group that's trying to force others to adhere to their religious views on abortion, on sex education, on scientific education, on contraceptives, on moral policy, nor is it the same group trying to push people to become Christian and demonize those who aren't. Surely they are not the ones making the day of prayer divisive...	24
1	&gt; "sufferers"  You had to insert a dig in there. You couldn't just say, "this is nice."  Response Edit: Traditionalists think discrimination is when people say, "it's not nice to put down gay people or their ordination" - LGBTQ people think discrimination is being kicked out of your home, given psychological conditions from spiritual/verbal/physical abuse, subjected to lives of poverty and substance abuse, or being murdered.	24

1	Well, I don't agree with full on prohibition today, but if you have a moment, check out Ken Burns documentary on the prohibition. Its easy to sympathize with the church's condemnation of alcohol when you see how bad things really got. It may not have been the perfect answer, but it helped move us toward a stance today which is decent, if imperfect.	24
1	I don't think it is unconstitutional either but these types of meetings send conflicting messages. If the politician *really* thinks the most important thing is to preach the salvation message rather than represent his constituents then maybe he should be a pastor. Once a politician starts pushing their faith they lose my vote but I'm sure that is more than compensated by pastors telling their congregation who to vote for.	24
0	Just so it's clear, casual sex is not always the same as premarital sex. In theory one could only have sex with one person without ever having some formal declaration of marriage.	24
1	I guess we have to consider the opposite, which would be a national day of not believing in God/a higher power and rejecting religion-based reflection. I understand the historical element argument with the rise in atheism in the West pushing predominantly right-wingers to call for this kind of recognition, and I understand the argument against something like this since it's an obvious attempt to promote the idea of the persecuted Christian.   Can't we just be secular and have a Day of Religious Reflection so that we can appreciate the benefits and consider the darker side of religion? I'd like that...	24
1	Nah no attack, I know. :)  It can be sinful because one of the aspects of Christian marriage is (or should be) physical intimacy. If done over a long term, it becomes selfish and hurtful.  Marital rape is a real thing and it's just as abhorrent and unconscionable as any other kind of rape. One spouse withholding sex is **never** a reason for the other to use force or coercion. Any abuse (sexual, physical, emotional, spiritual) of another person is always evil and never justifiable.	24

0	Sorry, I'd rather play with /u/Smile_U_On_Killa_Cam 's robots.  I can only do one favor at a time.  Maybe later.  :P	24
0	oh, I got you now.  I think this is an interesting question.  The reason I would point to is that churches don't teach these things very often, to control yourself and have a healthy outlook.  The tools for success in these areas are in the hands of man already, as mental health professionals can attest to.  God created a world where you can sow the seed and reap the rewards, in the soil, in the mind, in the body.	24
0	There is nothing in the bible covering this topic specifically, it will only let you know what a marriage should be.	24
0	&gt;Hatred, racism, murder, lying  Not necessarily, dont raise a child with any hatred towards anyone,  and they are unlikely to hate anybody barring some extreme circumstance.	24
0	I am glad too, I hope he helps them to overcome their problem. There is another possibility, seeing the state of the church, and it is that he encourages them to keep on their lifestyle, but given the information on the article, we cant really know.	24
1	That is...wow. Thats horrible.	24
0	The idea that the morality of God doesn't change is not true according to christianity because the morality of the new covenant is different than the morality of the old covenant.	24
1	I thought hard about things for months, and after a while I just realized I believed.	24
1	So all the murdery rapey people from ancient times are in heaven, but perfectly decent people who can't bring themselves to believe in God are going to burn in hell forever?	24
1	So why do people with parents who don't support being gay become gay? They certainly weren't groomed that way, and "made a choice" that risks them being rejected and disowned.	24
0	Seems irresponsible of the pope if he has the power to make certain statements which if he makes them the right way they're infallible to only do so like one every few hundred years. You'd think he'd make one every five minutes in order to solve pretty much every issue he could in record time.	24
1	Ergh. Do we really need to pay ten bucks to read a whole book to try and figure out what the bible's obvious position is?	24
1	If you are in the NYC area, I'd recommend checking out Redeemer Presbyterian. Very smart, rational church.  You can check out more info and sermons here: http://www.redeemer.com/	24

1	"They'll probably grow up to become murderers anyway!" doesn't seem like a solid excuse for killing infants.	24

0	Maybe for yec and anti-vaccine people.	24
1	I'm not sure it's an incorrect view of the law; I agree with you that the mob mentality had taken over. I don't think we're supposed to view the killing of Stephen as an act of justice, and Jews wouldn't have, either.	24
0	Only Jesus is fully God, fully man. Ascribing similar allusions to Mary is not correct. Unless I have missed something	24
1	I don't know how common this position is, but at least some people believe that destroying the planet (or making it uninhabitable by humans) via climate change or nuclear war or whatever is impossible, because God wouldn't let it happen. Only God can destroy the world at the end of time.   ...or whatever.	24
1	His thoughts on the symbol of the crucifixion just seems to be an asspull to justify his "art". Who says that the meaning of the crucifixion has changed? He himself?  It was anti-Christian when he thought it up, regardless of his personal interpretations.	24

1	You are free to pray. You can pray on TV, in front of a big crowd, I don't care. I would fight for your right to pray in peace, in any capacity you choose, in any number you choose. You could have a day organized by christian churches where christians fill the streets, and sing christian hymns, and pray, I couldn't care less.   But I think it is not right for the government to sanction a day of prayer. The government should have nothing todo with religion whatsoever. It isn't right.	24
0	Even when I was a christian I knew parts of the Bible were not true. I always questioned. In sunday school as a child someone would teach us something and my hand inevitably shot up and said something along the lines of "how?" Why?"	24

1	$20 says yes, because even heterosexual people are sinners.	24
1	"Welcoming gays" in Catholicspeak means, "shaming gay people into being closeted and celibate, with a pinch of smarm thrown in to make it seem okay."	24
1	It's not about enslaving people's minds, it's about conflating political issues with religious ones to get elected.   Look at climate change, for example. Is this a Biblical topic? No, it's a political one. Then why are most conservative Evangelicals "against" climate change? Because it has been made into a Biblical topic.	24
0	Where on the page does it say "We do not teach evolution to our students"?  I'm curious about what motivates these obviously false strawmen attacks. It's obviously not Liberty itself (as your post shows).  Is this some sort of ideological beef?	24
1	Celibacy is the emphasized ideal. Marriage is...well, it's fine. It's good, in fact. But you have a celibate Christ, you have Paul encouraging followers to be celibate and describing marriage as a path for those who couldn't be celibate, you have the whole monastic tradition. Marriage is not touted as the ideal.	24
0	Not attempting to be. Most people are unaware that there are apostolic churches in India as well as Africa.	24

0	Catholicism never changes, so, yes, it's fair to say "pre-60s" or even "pre-5th century". The only things that have happened since, is false religions growing in number (and notably, the Modernist sect taking over political control of the Vatican, but that was in the 50s) - but these things don't change Catholicism.	24

0	Oh. That's how it works.	24
1	&gt;  I think what it comes down to is that the church must find a way to express its ethics through better teaching if divorce is to be decried.  Better pre-marital counseling is the first step, in my opinion. I just see this as so very lacking. My priest does fifteen hours of "one-on-two" counseling with the couple before he will marry them, and maintains that his greatest pastoral success is convincing a engaged couple who came to him not to get married.	24

1	&gt; All humans are sinners and deserve death  &gt; That is a wonderful thing  You sound like a psychopath to me	24
1	Jesus would definitely get downvoted in this sub.	24
1	That's a highly logical argument. You're a *homophobe*, therefore anything you say is wrong!  Good job, mate.	24
1	This is one of the stupider ones I've seen.	24
0	Even though there is a lot here to prevent it from being used, some of the rules that could be punished by death were ridiculous.	24
1	Some of what people are saying is actual attempts at justification in my eyes. Other replies would align more with what you're saying.	24
0	Thats a gross mischaricterization of what I was saying. Sex is intended as a tool to be used to form monogomous lifelong relationships between a man and a woman, and to produce children.	24
1	No. It is merely an argument that has no basis in any god. Under secularism, in a country with religious freedom, it is equally wrong to pass a law based on the Koran and bind all people of all faiths to it as it is to pass a law on the bible. A secular argument and a secular law means that no one should be bound by law to follow a law of a religion.	24
1	It's been a thing for a long while. Age discrimination is very real, so much so that age is a protected class in United States law.   Of course, the protection applies to discriminating those above a certain age in hiring practices, but that's still ageism.	24
1	You can make that argument for a great many of movies. The last church I was a part of made that case with The Matrix.	24
0	Someone else actually already convinced me that there are major problems with the California bill as proposed (although not the ones I expected), but that doesn't change the fact that it is a legitimate political opinion, and the principle of which God Himself explicitly endorsed.  And even prior to changing my mind on this, I informed you I was willing to follow any rules you set down (including not advocating such politics). Thereafter you banned me from ##Christian, so I concluded your rationale was merely holding such an opinion, *not* advocating it as you seem to be implying - if I am wrong on that, please explain why I was/remain banned.	24
1	&gt; but if you want to be part of the Church you HAVE TO follow the doctrine of the church.   Sure, I agree completely. The part I *disagree* with is claiming this doctrine is somehow 'welcoming'.    You even said that a gay person and his family would "of course not" be welcome.	24
0	The definition exists, but it is implicit rather than explicit. There's the Genesis verses and Jesus' reiteration like you said. Deuteronomy 22:22 is the death penalty for sleeping with another man's wife. I guess we're just not going to agree.	24
0	That was rather dogmatic... I hope you know that isn't everyone's descrption. ( not even Paul the apostle).   What's your source on sin being that?	24
1	But *why*? There is literally no point	24
0	Indoctrinated is the correct term for what youre describing. It doesnt mean brain-washing. If my muslim neighbor raised his kids to follow the doctribe of his religion, that would be indoctrination. An other example of the term is the army's "tradoc" which stands for training and doctrine. Its just trleaching peolle a mindset that they may or may not agree with.	24
0	Then you have been vastly under-exposed to the people in the conservative faction of Christianity.  Your experience is severely out of balance with the actual distribution.	24
0	I was talking about supremacy. Infallability is moreso when the Church convenes and agrees on doctrine or dogma - the Bishop of Rome can use this infallability to make it such.	24
0	And God allowed it.	24
0	Well, good on you for being consistent afterall.  Unfortunately most Christians clearly don't concern themselves much with adultery, or at least don't want it enforced, but are concerned rather with the sins of others (which living as a homosexual should not be a sin anyway).	24
0	&gt;Bonhoeffer gave his life to stop the persecution and murder of minorities that DISAGREED with his religion. He was a living breathing incarnation of loving your neighbor and treating your neighbor as you would want to be treated.  So the last will be first....  &gt;The current crop of Evangelical leaders are going all out to inflict segregation, discrimination, and persecution upon a minority who disagrees with them. They couldn't be farther from the example of Bonhoeffer if they tried.  ...and the first, last.	24
0	I guess that would depend on your definition of "good". It's funny, if you ask 10 people to define the word "good", you'll get 10 different answers.	24

0	No. This is ridiculous. The metaphor simply doesn't apply. A discussion about whether it's possible to prove a subjective property of something we all agree exists has no significant similarities with a discussion about proving whether something exists.  Your instruction to look at this example metaphorically doesn't change that.	24
1	Christians who believe gay people are called to celibacy are often called "side B" Christians (as opposed to side A who believe monogamous same-sex relationships to be good, and side X who believe all same-sex attraction is sin). I admittedly know very little about the communities of side B Christians, but you can check out https://www.gaychristian.net/sideb.php for a community of others who do believe that way, if you're interested.

0	Yes, states regulate divorce, but they do not outlaw it. And the anti-adultery laws are more for show than anything else. It boils down to, in my opinion, whether you think America -- which at its core is supposed to be a nation built from the secular identity -- should change its foundation to directly adopt Biblical laws.	24

0	You know that words have meanings, right? You don't have to look into secret subtle meanings as if you're confused about the regular one. Marriage in general is formulated around an arrangement that is sexual. A word to specify the sexual arrangement is in fact itself. To act like there's some other context marriage exists in that has nothing to do with sex is trying to crowbar in non common cases because they're technically possible.	24
0	I don't know but some butt-hurt Buddhist is following me around questioning my posts.

1	The Holy Spirit protects the Church from error in specific cases where we are making infallible statements regarding faith and morals. Marriage is one of those cases, but that doesn't mean that everything the Pope or Church does and says is infallible.   You don't even understand infallibility but you still criticize it.	24
1	How far do we take it? Should we outlaw divorce, adultery and masturbation?  The same people that want to prevent gay marriage also want to blow up the entire Middle East. War is far worse than some gay guys getting a piece of paper.	24

0	Very inspiring.  Nice way to inspire more people to give you more of their money.  Honestly, this just looks like a marketing campaign to guilt people into giving more money.  The best part in the video is the ending, when she says that "the church wants this person to know the nickel and the dime and the three pennies you left.... counts", then it stops. The church doesn't go on to say how they're spending that donation in a way that it will give back to the community.  It "counts". It counts to make the church richer.	24
1	This is a great list, but it would be a shame to leave out a pacifist denomination like Mennonite (Brethern) or Quaker.  (Are Adventists pacifist? - not sure, but in any case they wouldn't be a good replacement.)  But I don't know which of your list to bump!  OP, can you insert an extra month?	24
1	They do that to every fast growing movement (in their eyes) ; it's not persecution driven by hatred of the gospel itself	24

1	That's cool you love Jesus. So do I.	24
0	&gt;Why can't Tradition be considered a rule of faith as well? Like a regulative principle to interpret Scripture for example.  It is, tradition is the normed norm and Scripture is the norming norm. That is to say that we judge the truth of tradition (the creeds etc.) on the basis of its agreement with Scripture which is why the Book of Concord contains the Creeds.  I think too many people have this idea that Sola Scriptura means you can't use or value tradition as if its just you sitting with the Bible coming up with doctrine. When it means that Scripture alone is the norming norm for the faith.	24
0	are you saying that jesus is 1/2 god and 1/2 man?!  white cant be black, black cant be white. if an object is both black and white, that object cant be 100% white nor 100% black, it may be 50% or 40% black etc etc. but not 100% black  a true god must be 100% god.	24

0	I agree, since he also supported slavery and the oppression of women, two things god had shown he didn't care for by that time. Paul infused a lot of his own opinion in his work.  Note that none of Paul's verses actually condemn homosexuality as a sin, however. Massive misconception.	24
0	But liking it doesn't automatically equate to me being exclusively biologically inclined to like it.  That's the shoddy science most people are making here.  As if I have no choice in the matter because of my genes.	24
0	I think perhaps that verses taken out of context do not convey the intended meaning. **John 14:28 - "If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I."**  Well by your same interpretation I **must** love Jesus, because I celebrate his ascension?	24

1	It's clear unless you try to make it unclear, these verses have been understood as clear condemnations of homosexual acts for centuries, it's only in the last few decades that anyone has come up with complicated theories of cultural context, conveniently at the same time Western society started considering homosexual acts as not sinful.	24

0	well for one you have a major online blog publishing attack articles suggesting (rather insensitivity) that they are doing christians a favor by persecuting us.  the issue is not that Christian persecution doesn't exist, the issue is that secularists (including secularized Christians) don't see it.

1	&gt; Calling her "woman" was a term of respect and endearment - it didn't come across the way it sounds in English in our day.  Yes your right. I just looked it up. Thanks for the clarification.	24
0	It is on that presumption that the faith of every Protestant and every Eastern Orthodox rests, and when a billion people have that presumption, it's not really that presumptuous, no. (It's equally presumptuous, I'd say, for the Pope to assume that all these other people are abandoned by the Spirit, which he sorta has to maintain unless he wants to admit that _Unam sanctam_ was incorrect.)	24
0	&gt; Lots of talk, little evidence.  If that truly bothers you, offer counter evidence of your own.	24
1	I grew up attending a Church of Christ and they take the whole not being a denomination thing pretty seriously. I understand where they're coming from but it's funny because they're pretty much a denomination.	24
1	Love this. As a bisexual who has maintained my sexual purity more than most straight Christians (25 year old virgin, never had a porn habit), I get really mad at some of the assumptions people make about Christians who experience same-sex attractions.   And that statement about my sexual purity isn't out of pride or some attempt to win the moral high ground. God knows that I have sinned plenty. But we need to show that it's possible for an LGBT person to be chaste without undergoing sexually repressive psychotherapy first.	24
1	&gt; Is there any resource I can use to date a bible?  Good heavens! They were right. First it starts with a man wanting to date another man. Now someone wants to date a bible! Where will it end!!!  (This post subtitled for the humor impaired)	24
1	I guess it has to do with the fact that the majority of LGBT Christians do not want to live lives of celibacy	24
0	do you know that not all faith is leading to goodworks? so saying "faith alone" is not biblical and there are faith that does not have work. Faith does not automatically lead you to work, no. it is not something that go hand-in-hand to some, for true Christians, it should go hand in hand but there is a faith in a man that does not force him to do work, so faith and woks do not work automatically because there are faith that does not motivates people to do good but evil. So faith alone is not biblical.	24
1	I AM THE 1%	24

0	Which is why Christians invented the concept of orphanages and have done more the aid the poor then any other group in history. Sadly, it is people such as yourself want to put an end to it by forcing Christians to commit murder, hire people who wish to see Christianity driven out of existence, etc. The very real harm non-Christians are doing to the poor is incalculable. Not to mention people having their teeth cleaned have a far safer regulatory environment then those having the very dangerous surgical abortion procedure - see Gosnell and look at the poor women he murdered...he was and is not a unique case.	24

1	There's a very clever pun in [col 2:8 nrsv] - see to it that nobody takes you captive.  The word for "captive" here is a really rare word, so I understand: "συλαγωγῶν", or *sylagogon*.  Now the word for synagogue is "συναγωγήν", or *synagogon*.  So Col 2:8's "let no one take you captive" , "let no one drag you off", is really a clever way of saying "let no one en-synagogue you!" - let noone drag you to the synagogue!	24

0	So we can't note where we are being consistent in interpreting Paul's meaning? We have to focus on your argument which has very little doctrinal, historical, contextual, and [linguistical](https://carm.org/romans-1-26-27-homosexuality) backing?   Not going to do that.	24

1	You mean slightly less. Lets not kid ourselves here. Most threads there are a few voices of reason, and hordes of crazy people insisting that its really important to think Jesus never even existed, but not quite able to explain why him existing alone puts christianity at risk of being true. The people there aren't much better, its just that there's less memes, and they're at least trying to be serious.	24
0	what is that church? name?	24
0	I disagree, I don't think forgiving yourself is a scriptural concept - we focus on repentance and rebirth.  Feeling excessive guilt is not a scriptural concept, but forgiving yourself isn't really scriptural either imo.  Feeling guilty is a part of repentence, and repentance is the key to spiritual renewal .	24

1	Well, it would depend, I guess. If someone just out of nowhere on the street and said, "God's not real," I'd feel mostly confused. If it's someone I know, though, I usually feel a bit sad for the person, because they don't have the relationship to God that I do. I also get a little excited, because it's an open opportunity to talk about my faith, which I usually don't get in my day-to-day life.	24

1	The "purity" argument is an illusion.    I had a girlfriend who was the most anal person about "remaining pure." She took it to the point of almost worshipping purity for just the sake of being pure. It was the most absurd thing. It was then that I realized that we have elevated "sexual purity" to such an insane level that it stopped being about God at all, and started being about us. Very pharisaical.	24
0	I would have referred to your denomination's reverence for the psalms and other OT scripture (the Prophets), but I wish I could agree with you. Unfortunately, the earliest evidence points to the rejection of Paul and the other Apostles by leadership in some churches, and clearly the prophetic order referred to in the Didache is gone.  To me it's no surprise that the "pillar" is divided, i.e. fallen.	24
1	I'm not sure you have been following the news. He will probably get thousands from anonymous donors for this.	24
0	&gt; It is even a possibility that when Jesus talks about 'eternal life' he is talking about a full life lived in this moment rather than about life which goes on forever.  Please explain this using verses that talk about the rewards you get in the (not so) after life. No understanding of the bible would lead me to believe such a thing. Feel free to enlighten me on that interpretation.	24

0	That's a false analogy. You cannot, reasonable, equate the actions of a person with that of a computer program.   However, I did ask if you believed the actions of man are that [totally] deterministic. I guess you're sticking with that position but I hoped you wouldn't since you alluded to genetics only be partially responsible. So within your world view, humans cannot (ethically or otherwise) be held responsible for any of their actions. They are simply the peons of a God or evolution who have no agency whatsoever.	24

1	The best way to describe it would be the way that God loves us. It's not romantic or warm and fuzzy-its the kind of love where you would willingly give your life for that person without question.	24
0	Not sure what quote you're referring to. St. Paul said it is good to abstain, but this is only by consent of both spouses.	24
0	The people whose form won out through violence and then pretend it was some kind of process of well thought out scholarship that was constantly reaffirmed in an honest and open fashion who then exclude everyone else, by now only verbally, despite their on version including a lot of content they made upa after the fact have a tenuous claim. There's definitely many parts of the Bible where Jesus places himself below God.	24
1	Can we agree up front that Whore of Babylon isn't an option?	24
1	It's not so much the accuracy, but what such inaccurate depictions say about ourselves -- to change the truth that was handed to us to make *ourselves* feel more comfortable.  Tradition, including Scripture, speaks clearly that the Lord is Jewish.	24
0	So here's the thing. It's problematic to try and separate sex from procreation, because that's a fundamental part of sex. And not to turn this into a giant circle, but if you love him, why are you so afraid of committing?  And you avoiding a label because it can be misunderstood is also problematic. Denominations are more than just labels, they are statements of belief.	24

0	I believe science is right and God created with 'the snap of His fingers'. Seems like a contradiction? Let me explain my opinion on this. God spoke the universe into existence, like Genesis tells us. He created the tree, not the seed and he created the chicken, not the egg. So when science tries to backtrack to the seed, surely they will find billions of years, but that's not how it happened. God didn't say:let there be light and then sat down for billions of years to see a star clumping together from dust. You can't always extrapolate your data to time t=0.	24
1	Churches *should* have images of Christ. Iconoclasm is a heresy.	24
1	Denying science is utterly idiotic; it rejects the rational capacity of our brains and is blasphemous in the process. We are forcibly making God fit into a ludicrous box we are constructing out of a particular view of scripture rather than exploring God and the natural world rationally, particularly when God is letting us understand that he works in a much more elegant and long term way than we had previously imagined.	24

1	When I was in NC a bunch of my friends were being confirmed into the Episcopal Church.  After the service, they dragged me up to Bishop Curry and told him that he should confirm me.  He looked at us very confused, and said hello.  But now that I think of it, Bishop Breidenthal is supposed to be at my friend's wedding in October.  I'm told the plan is to have me sit next to him, in hopes that he will convert me.  So now there's a 1 in 4 chance I could be sitting next to the Presiding Bishop.	24

If it helps you in any way, the overwhelming majority of Christian denominations (including the Catholic and Orthodox churches) accept evolution as being a valid theory.

I've successfully channeled it into a single monogamous married relationship, but I'm certain that suppressing my sexuality for life would be impossible.	24

Two, atheists are a minority out in the world of religious people who use their privilege to make laws and push their religion in schools or public offices. Atheists need somewhere to vent and share ideas and share how they feel, so /r/atheism is that place. We can't just go up to our moms, bosses, friends, etc and tell them our honest opinion about the concepts they believe. If you don't like it there, by all means, you don't have to go there.	24

It saves us from some awkwardness when people notice we didn't take it, and we don't believe there's anything spiritual or magical about it, so why wouldn't we? It's just a thing you do at church, and we were at church, so we took it.	24

1	In reading about archeology and history of the time, realizing how much wealth and power disparity there was between the high priest and roman government officials compared to the peasants and fisherman  from Galilee.   Somehow I had always picture the struggle in Jesus' final days between people closer in social standing, not realizing it was a much more impossibly lopsided situation to have Jesus go before the high priests and Pilate.  Maybe like having a poor homeless rural migrant worker go before the State Supreme Court and Mayor of New York City to have a death penalty confirmed.	24

0	&gt;I disagree. The Church, which I'll asume means any organized Christian denomination(correct me if I'm wrong), has fucked up a lot.  This is obvious, and quite plain.  Of course it has, it is made many, many, many mistakes through history.  It is run by imperfect humans, of course it has.  To claim the "rightness" BS is almost insane.  I also think is a little blasphemous as well.	24
0	&gt; I don't recall Jesus ever providing food or celebrating a gay wedding either.  He also never said that gay weddings should be repudiated.	24
1	Holy untenable mash-up of misunderstood philosophical positions, Batman!	24
0	If it's wrong, I don't want to be right.	24
0	Which Church teaching is that? Please point me to the Church teaching that calls for open borders. At least Protestants can use the "interpretation" excuse for their nonsense. Where in the CCC does it say that we can't restrict immigration just like every other first world country including Germany, France, Switzerland etc?	24
0	I believe God intervenes in our physical world as He sees fit according to His will. I think deism is an easy belief to fall into as it lessens the problem of evil, but I don't think it fits with the Christian belief that God is love. Nor does it fit with Scripture nor Church tradition.	24
0	&gt; Alimony, division of assets, child support, etc  Those are not fines, and there's nothing theocratic about breach of contract.	24
1	I would say that both of these men stopped having faith. God didn't give up on them, they gave up on God.	24
1	Ohhhh gotcha. Figured Hitler would show up in this thread eventually.	24
0	These might be all interesting texts, but I find it hard to understand why we must listen to theologians and various authors who are experts in the study of the bible - to be able to understand the bible. A text which acts as a guide for how to live a good life should be quite a bit easier to read, I think.	24
1	"Only God can judge me."  The subtext being that God is on my side and approves of my behavior even if you can't see that.	24
0	Times haven't changed that much. The KJV is still one of the best bibles around.  A lot of people actually find it easier to understand than many so-called 'modern' versions.	24
0	&gt; Oh, you change of opinion quickly uh?  Not really. That's why I'm still a part of the denomination I was born into	24
0	This is talking about judgment after physical death.  This isn't saying that all sins will result in a tribunal sentencing you to death.	24
0	Atheists are human beings, some good and some not so good.  Some, especially the college age crowd, think being an atheist makes them smarter than everyone else.  Some for one reason or another don't believe we must pray for them.	24
0	He recognized the sexist culture. That's not the same.	24
0	So phenomenally terrible you just can't even say what's wrong with it? I would say the more terrible it is, the easier that would be.  So he should hate his wife? Be mad at her? What's your suggestion? We should feel sorry for him? I feel sorry for HER. She's obviously lost.	24
0	Stressed about what? The love of God? Are you feeling stressed and wish to talk about it?	24
0	That's modalism, Patrick. Or partialism. Take your pick, depending on what words are being emphasized. Emphasizing sharing of essence isn't beyond controversy when you're making sure to emphasize them being distinct entities. At that point, the sharing of essence is barely a meaningful distinction. Its really special pleading to think Jews won't have a problem with it.	24
0	Oh, sorry to hurt you with my mere opinion.	24
1	A good book on the subject is *Moral Minority: The Evangelical Left in an Age of Conservatism* by David Swartz.  Really interesting thoughts on why the evangelical left (theologically conservative people with a desire for social justice) lost out to the Religious Right for political influence.	24
0	A non-Christian man and woman can get married in a "natural" marriage.  This is not sacramental, but it is marriage (for example, they are not fornicating).  A baptized man and woman, if they get married, have a "sacramental" marriage.  This is true if they are Catholic or otherwise.  If one is baptized and the other is not, then it is natural.  Two persons of the same-sex cannot have a natural or sacramental marriage.	24
0	Greed starts with the first dollar	24
0	Well technically it doesn't imply that, in much the same way that not believing in a god doesn't necessitate an *uncaused* universe. They could just as easily be in some sort of artificial womb without ever having been inside a woman (Not that those exist but I hope you get my point).    Anyway, I deliberately didn't mention the mother because it wasn't relevant to my point about each of them believing / not believing without evidence since they have reason to suspect that she exists.	24
1	&gt; P.S. As a American citizen, it is my duty to hate Obama but love the U.S. Constitution. I'm not even that conservative...  What does that even *mean*?	24

0	Catholic doctrine requires the State to recognise God as its source of authority, at the very least.  In other words, that section would probably be acceptable if it were rewritten as such:  &gt; There shall be no law ~~respecting the establishment of religion or~~ prohibiting or penalizing the free exercise [of religion] ~~thereof~~. Religious freedom shall not justify practices inconsistent with public morals, peace or safety. No revenue of the state or any political subdivision or agency thereof shall ever be taken from the public treasury directly or indirectly in aid of any church, sect, or religious denomination or in aid of any sectarian institution.	24

0	Nah, it's not a journal article or anything. He is definitely writing to the public. He explains himself really well. He just doesn't dumb it down.	24
1	I would say that giving constant tax breaks to the rich would at least seem like a paradox.  Also I'd argue that ignoring how many companies are destroying the planet is at least negligent on our behalf.   And my last and most important point, I'd say that for a group that follows the teaching of a man who spent half his ministry healing the sick, universal healthcare should be a no-brainer.	24

0	Done or not, it's still an absurd equivalence.	24
0	I only know a couple other debaters who are gay, but my best guess would be about 1 in 3 coaches/administrators is gay. That may vary between high school and college though, I haven't seen any public high school forensic teams before.	24

0	Oh my, I love riddles!  Not really.   On a more serious note. Why are such simple questions causing such a fuss?  I simply asked why do God allow natural disasters. And instead of a response I'm attacked for asking the question. I simply wonder why.	24
1	&gt; Well, that is a huge discussion  That's precisely why you should shut the hell up about Hitler being an atheist.   If you agree there's a "huge discussion", you're obviously being dishonest when you write nonsense such as "Atheism (Hitler)".	24
1	It sounds like the team was all basically pressured into it. In situations like that anyone not doing it directly calls attention to themselves as different and an outsider. In the heavily Christian US, particularly in the south and more so in rural areas everywhere, identifying as a non Christian often leads to mockery, bullying, alienation, etc.	24
1	Ok so besides consent what are the requirements?	24
1	No. But I guess if you squint hard enough, you can find signs of demonic activity in a cookbook.  Devil's Food Cake? Unclean!	24

0	all of disneys films are demonic, if you look at the end credits, you can see they are funded by the iluminati. Also, if you play the let it go track backwords, it says "worship satan" Stay away from disney, there the devils company	24
0	No there isn't.  It's just not recognized.  Honestly, the main arguments for marriage equality rest on marriage as a tax write-off or for insurance purposes.   A flat tax and a free market would negate any sort of "advantage" marriage confers, and then we could all be free to recognize, or not, each other's marriages.    I'll interact with, love, care for, and protect a gay couple that live together with all my heart... But I will go to the guillotine before I call it marriage.	24
0	I'm exactly as interested in continuing this as I am for showing how the Bible says that women are people.  Take it up with [the mods]( http://reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/351t85/more_americans_are_comfortable_with_a_gay/cr0m4jl), not me.	24

1	God let me know he is real for a fact!  And Jesus died for my sins so I get to go to Heaven.   Every moment of Heaven will be better than our best moment down here on Earth.     Colossians 3:1 You have been raised to life with Christ, so set your hearts on the things that are in heaven, where Christ sits on his throne at the right side of God.  Servitude and just neutral time passing is positive gain because I get closer to Heaven.   I want to serve the best I can because Jesus died for me and I want to live for him.	24

0	To me, it seems to run about 50/50. Half the people complain that churches are not friendly. The other half complain that churches are aggressive.  The people of the Body of Christ are your relatives. You are supposed to love them, bless them and pray for them.  Are you too important to interact with them?	24
1	Don't forget people still remember Bush jr as well. But yeah, Huckabee is scary.	24
0	&gt; 99% of prayers seem to go unanswered.  They are always answered.  Sometimes the answer is, "No."	24
0	&gt; he did accept Jesus Christ as his lord and savior  Many false professors "accept Jesus Christ as their lord and savior", yet are unregenerate and do not truly believe.  I'm sure Joel Osteen "accepts Jesus Christ as his lord and savior", yet he's a false teacher who whores out his perversion of the gospel to make millions.  Again, this is where our worldviews conflict.  I believe that there is a difference between genuine faith given by God and the false faith of false professors, you don't.	24

0	Not a weapon, an inflatable tube.   You could beat a child with one of those and they'd just giggle at you.  He clocked her in the face for it.  In this case he was definitely the asshole.	27
1	It isn't about the cause it is about their ego which their cause is just a means to inflate.	27
0	Reminds me of gym class. Wanting to stop running because of extreme pain, but my teacher berating me to keep running.   "Come on, you can do it!"  Who knew death was fast approaching. Though, I was a fat kid trying to finish the mile before class ended, and you know... I lived.	27

0	Fair enough, except i've spoken to at least a hundred feminists, all of which fall under this category. This isn't even considering reddit. That'd probably shoot this number into the thousands. They're very vocal and prevalent here.	27
1	I like the sister's conclusion the guy is a virgin. She using some deductive reasoning on a whole other level. Also her evaluation of a human being's worth based on if said being ever had sex. What a scholar. She's even a nurse! I feel like if her state's nursing board ever got wind of this, it wouldn't end well for her.	27
1	If a dude did that he would get sex offender treatment, or at least an eval for it.	27
1	&gt; Gaining or losing weight can be easier or harder depending on genetics though.  And gaining and losing height is impossible, regardless of genetics.	27
1	&gt; Feminist, at the core of it all, believe in equality. They believe that men and women are equal and thus should be treated equally in all aspects of life. From employment and pay wage to personal respect and responsibility, a woman should be seen and treated as one would see and treat a male.   That is literally the definition of egalitarianism. If Feminism isn't focused on women it wouldn't be called Feminism.	27
0	This is reddit, they're not out to be a safe haven	27
1	I commented on one that seem deleted, I side with the woman on this one this is not PPD and these guards are at best unprofessional and at worst "utter cunts"   thinking someone "appearing nervous" is legit grounds to impound and detain your car is fucking ridiculous.  this border patrols are bang out of order, I support her conduct and cause, she has every right to defend her rights and kudos to her for not kowtowing to a bully.	27
0	At no point in the article did anyone including the woman in question say "women can't be held accountable when they're drunk" she did try to use the defense that she was too intoxicated to remember but gender was never brought up. This isn't PPD and your title is a lie.	27
0	Hence the pass was denied.	27
1	Their "cause" has far exhausted its relevance; there is not a "proper" way to go about it anymore baring some very specific instances.	27

0	She essentially hit him with a pool toy and he decked her.  I'm no white knight, but there are degrees of provocation.  Would you knock someone out if they hit you with a snowball?	27
1	This isn't PPD, this is a violation of civil rights. They attempted to illegally detain a law student while waiting for drug dogs to show up (which found nothing when they finally did), and when she let them know that she knew her rights and wouldn't stand for it, they assaulted her.  I hope this girl gets a nice award from this.	27
0	So I can tell people I'm going to rape them at a later date and time then? Because that makes sense /s	27

0	You seem pretty salty about a simple question.	27
1	I'm 6'1" and I too think that she is a "dumb fat whale piece of shit" as well as a cheeseburger eating fuck. I'm not even short and I still get pissed that women somehow think what she said in her status was okay. What a hypocrite POS.	27
1	i honestly don't know what to say...	27
0	You can't really go against the narrative in this sub, though, obviously. Most of my comments get downvoted by misogynistic twats. I'm totally in favor of denying the pussy pass every time, but these guys just take it to a different level. I'm gonna B out of this sub.	27

0	Those are some impressive mental gymnastics you're pulling off there.  Disagreeing on fatpeoplehate is fine, just don't break the rules, which is not to disagree with fatpeople hate.

0	Not that it matters that much, but, Airman, Soldier, Sailor and Marine are generally capitalized when talking about the U.S. military profession:  "I was an Airman for 15 years, while my friend, Dave, is a Marine and Melanie has been a Sailor since 1998."  ...as opposed to...  "We don't have enough soldiers to continue the war; they all quit and are working as sailors, now."	27

1	to be fair, that moment never happened in this video. Even after she got laid out and was thrown from the train, she's still screaming and banging on shit. Let us hope this video being on the internet forever will be some good embarrassment for her at least.	27
1	I want to hear from someone she knows. Does she feel ashamed? Does she regret acting like a god damn animal? She got what was coming to her that's for sure.. I just would like to know if she understands that.	27
1	Not sure. Maybe because women usually don't ever get sentences even remotely this long for crimes like homicide? So I guess it could be a pussypassdenied in that respect, since she was sentenced as if she were a man.	27
1	and yet here you are bitching about it...	27
0	Ruined his life seems a little extreme unless you're referring to ongoing emotional trauma. I could give 2 fucks what my old highschool classmates think. I'm not trying to downplay the situation but it seems to me that he'll be able to find a job, given no charges sticking, even of he has to drive a ways to get there. Seriously fucked up and distressing? Definitely. Life ruined? I'm not so sure. I'm not trying to be argumentative	27
1	I completely lost it at that point. It's perfect.	27
1	Don't know shit about the Japanese and Chinese, Scandinavians, or Turkish. Now that I'm reflecting on it, I do know and have a lot of experience with black people it's weird. It's true what they say - actual Africans are like completely different. Very polite and caring.	27
1	This may be a repost but I'll always watch it straight thru.  Dumb bitch tries to throw a rape charge and slowly backs down as Pirro trashes her bullshit story.  Guy looks like a bit of a douche but side bitch learned she's a side bitch and that her bullshit won't fly.   10/10 post that shows what this sub is truly about.	27
1	She got lucky that they didnt find her PCP.   No fucking way she acted that way on just weed.	27
0	LOL you wrote an entire essay trying to defend your comment and you literally failed to provide a valid argument the entire time. The judge was simply disciplining her because he (and anyone with eyes) could obviously see that she wasn't taking anything seriously... nobody should sympathize for a spoiled brat.. at no point did she show "disdain." You should do some soul searching and understand the real reason why you are upset.. maybe because he was being culturally insensitive and you are sensitive to that because you are of spanish decent.. or you are a ghetto hood rat that listened in English class. Hope you find your inner peace some day my friend. :)	27
1	&gt; I don’t care for anyone else, I drive where I please.  I don't speak Russian, but I googled for it and managed to find a translation on an article about an older video and from what I can see the stickers are unchanged between them.	27
0	Canada isn't a police state where the cops think their job is to "destroy all resistance". Public relations is part of the job and why we don't have a hate/fear relationship with cops like you Yanks seem to. A few polite words to the bystanders goes a long way toward humanizing the LEOs and disarming the situation.	27

1	If thirteen girls were raped, do you honestly think not one of them would have came forward when it happened. I can understand a few being scared or something. But thirteen. I mean come on you sound retarded.	27
1	Talk to a feminist. They actually believe this. It wasn't manufactured from thin air to generate hate, it generates hate because it was manufactured from thin air.  Despite what morons believe, only a non-feminist is capable of independent and rational thought.	27
1	i dont think the guy really knew what he was doing though it was just a defensive reaction. so its not like he said "fuck this im still hitting her even though shes a girl!" the guy didnt mean to punch anybody.	27

1	"We need to teach men not to rape!"  *deafening sound of limp-wristed applause*  "We need to teach women not to abuse the legal system as a form of petty revenge!"  *glass shatters as thousands of women hiss in unison*	27
0	Yeah I'm not sure is it was restraint. I feel like the slap was good enough, but combating racism with violence like THAT may have been a little too far. However, I get why he would do that and it was satisfying nonetheless.	27
1	How is this comment relevant at all? The double standard is correct. Had a man came at a bouncer several times with his shoes none the less, he would've been sleeping. It wouldn't even mattered if it was a small dude á la Woody Allen.	27
1	Have you thought about posting this in /r/TumblrInaction OP?	27
0	She doesn't have a constitutional right to act out in contempt of court.   What's that? Your argument is shut down entirely? Damn.	27
0	Get off of reddit.	27
1	equal rights, equal fights	27
0	Oh please, as if this comment section hasn't already told you how stupid this post was.	27
0	Does this mean peanuts, staircases and wet shower floors are also deadly weapons? They have killed and will kill again.	27
1	No, the US is supposed to use "innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt" for all criminal cases.  A slick enough lawyer can get a jury to forget that, and juries are often in a rush to convict if the accusation is rape, but it is SUPPOSED to be innocent until proven guilty.	27
1	Gonna have to agree with you, felt more like he wanted to keep a friend out of trouble.	27
1	My guess? Excessive bail.	27

1	&gt;What's so fucking annoying is the chavy White Knight cunt and the fact she started lying about the taxi man hitting her just because she disagrees with the guy, so she lies to try and get a bunch of men to fuck him because she disagrees.  Welcome to the world of using the Victim Narrative as a means of inciting Social Aggression and proxy violence.	27
0	&gt; You on the other hand seem to just plain hate women  If the person who got chucked in the canal was a belligerent male you and I would not being having this discourse.    &gt;You hate women specifically  I quite love women. But because I called your ass out you say such things is terrible.  &gt;I've defended this sub before, but no more  You have defended it to nobody you stupid fuck.

1	Yeah you are right. I forgot about that and come to think of it didn't the article mention she was pregnant from a different guy? Man these guys are either blind or amazingly desperate.	27

1	Comments like this are lame, no one cares you are leaving so you don't have to announce it. Just hit the button and leave.	27
0	And the sample size is way too small to make an overarching statement.  You can downvote me,  but that does not suppress the logic.  It was a generalization,  regardless of if it was a 'statistic'.  Just because something is quantified does not mean it's meaningful. Especially in the context of that guy's statement.	27

0	That's how sentences are determined, Einstein.  It's often a question of what is needed to ensure this person learns from their mistakes.  A person crying and apologizing is more likely to learn from their ordeal and thus get a lighter sentence than someone who is laughing and playing around.  It being against the law is irrelevant.	27

1	&gt;If you had reasonable suspicion that i did such a thing  That's not how our justice system works.	27
1	Yes, and no. I've had many a girl try to hit me. Drunk women aren't very coordinated though so it's easy to dodge. Fuck that bitch in the video though. What a cunt.	27
1	How can the sister be a nurse and that stupid?	27

1	Everything on 4chan is made up, especially if it's real.	27
0	Usually you can't sign away rights to a human who doesn't exist yet, so it would be interesting to see the contract she broke, considering she wasn't supposed to have the baby baptized without permission.	27
0	You don't recall the police attacking protestors? Convenient.  Occupy was physically shut down at the assembly level. You're going off on tangents not related to that. Understandable, you never had a point.	27
1	I do see such a use. She expects to be able to jump on the student's desk without repercussion.	27
0	&gt; Holy shit. What is it the feminists are fond of saying? If you've had so much as a sip of beer you're too drunk to give consent, and it's rape?  Definitely a real thing that feminists are fond of saying and in no way an absurdly obvious legend that makes no sense.	27

0	What an original joke!	27
0	&gt;So if all the drugs and illegals make it past the border thats it they win? We stop looking?  No, we continue to look using legal and constitutional measures.    The point being that doing a search just because someone is nervous does not fly as probably cause.  It would fly AT the border but once you are past the border you need to do better than that.	27
0	Although I don't necessarily agree with you, I thought she was in college and not high school.	27
0	Alright man, calm down. I've made a simple statement about some stupid misspelling on a commonly used word. It doesn't make me Satan, or give you the right to be a rude dick about it.	27
0	I know. People are all like "This guy's a hero." and I'm sitting here like he was acting totally ridiculous. Following them to their car, the way he screamed and stomped his feet. Spraying them and being the first to start something physical. That was awful.	27
0	This. Plenty of cops love to yap at, and argue with dipshits. They think they are there to instill their profound wisdom on idiots, thereby curing them of their terminal dumbassery.	27
1	If you say so buddy.	27

0	The worst thing about the rights granted by the First Amendment is that those rights are given to people we disagree with. But you have to deal with that if you value the basic principles of a free society.	27
0	eh. yes. i mean. pretty much. i dont really care though. most of the vids are just a woman getting the bad end of some scenario with a veeeeeery faint pp attempt or not one at all. but the mods are very open about their laziness. i agree its a bit shit but it doesnt bother me.	27
1	Holy shit man, $419 a week? That's more than I make.	27
1	Being pregnant doesn't make your face and entire body swell up with excess fat. You can maintain an actual body builders physique while pregnant but far too many people just use it as an excuse to fall into their vices and lounge around all day. You can easily visit any African village and look for pregnant women, they'll most likely be working around the village doing their daily tasks and looking thin sans the enlarged stomach.	27
0	The wedding was the next weekend.  They stayed married for 32 years until she passed away from chronic bitch disease.	27
0	There is something called proportinal response.   Granted if something is harsh enough the response you dilver doesnt have to be proportinal but there is still a limit. Someone slaps you? Killing them would not be an acceptable response. Punching them would be.  Someone hits you with a soft object that causes no more pain than a poke then laying them out would be but pushing them would be.  Now if the witnesses are correct in that she punched with object in hand rather than hit with soft object then fine.  Touching someone doesnt warrant such a violent reaction.	27
1	Can you do this with anything? (Have a misdemeanor assault from when I was 18... high-school fight stuff that has haunted me.)	27
0	I a,more try sure a civil suit is not a "charge" legally speaking.	27
0	Well said, and yes I think I referenced the K9 law.  I've seen similar videos and she was clearly given conflicting information, I hope there's a hearing on this.	27
0	She is arrested for disturbing the peace and assault, not for arguing with them. In America people have certain freedoms, and an individual violating them is arrested. In this case, she shoved one of the men when she couldn't get her point across and was arrested for it.	27
0	Sure it is.  State's have their own laws, but the common law definition is pretty well defined.  Ex:   &gt;Simple assault can be distinguished without the intent of injury upon another person. The violation of one's personal space or touching in a way the victim deemed inappropriate can be simple assault.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault#United_States	27

0	..you are a moron...	27
1	I imagine a civil suit will follow once he is exonerated.	27
1	And if you stuck your dick in that crazy bitch she would scream rape one nanosecond after she sobered up.  I would pepper spray her.	27
1	So he's an idiot for running away and not just fucking shooting every single person that charged him? Idiots like you just make it harder for everyone else to legally own one for protection.	27
0	Heavily downvoted because you were wrong, so there is that.	27
0	So they're both perverts.	27
1	The videos fine. Pussy pass denied is ultimately about women not being treated like special snowflakes or given special circumstances because they're women. Anything happening to women is basically qualifying for this subreddit. Frankly I think the screaming and trying to justify assaulting an officer because "You pushed me" and "are you fucking retarded" definitely came from something other than her civil liberties.  Anybody telling you otherwise is butthurt over the video.	27
0	i remember reading his website that was titled something along the lines of "greatest thing ever".	27
0	Do you not see the difference or are you autistic?  Nobody assumed OP created the link. We don't think he's a journalist. He doesn't receive credit for the article.  The comment, we assumed was written by the user. We mentally gave him credit for the work even though he stole it.  No difference there? None at all?	27
0	While I disagree with some peoples opinion that this sub is another version of "beating women"  Some of the submissions certainly are making it easy for them to think that	27
0	Nervousness can not be used as probably cause.  There were cases where an officer pulled over someone for driving properly at the speed limit, with hands at 10 and 2.  He had drugs, but it was thrown out because that is not a reason to stop someone.  So someone acting normal is not probably cause.  And driving up to a Border patrol checkpoint where people have guns and being nervous is normal.	27

1	I was a little shocked when I found out how much I had to pay.  I was thinking I was going to run off free!  But, even with paying her $419/ wk I was able to get out of 20k in debt within a year, and then finally start saving.  I was living paycheck to paycheck with her.  She was sucking me dry and dragging me deeper and deeper in debt.	27
1	after reading the comments of other people that witnessed it, she punched him in the face while holding the thunder stick in her hand. she never *actually* hit him with the stick.	27
0	I'd like to see what the black guy did to piss her off.	27

1	Hey I gotta tell you - if I were single and some hot young naked chick ran into my room yelling 'I LOVE MARIJUANA!'... i'd be fucking tempted.	27
1	though not PPD, if they told her to wait her ass on the side of the road because they decided they wanted to inspect her car, she should have waited her ass on the side of the road.  Whether or not you like the authority they have, they have it and will be backed up by the people that gave them that authority.  She was being a bitch and non compliant to very calm officers telling her they are waiting for the K9 unit to arrive.  She got irate and her actions led to her being tazed.	27

0	well the girl in the status is prolly 13-15 so kind of ez pickings	27
0	Yeah this stupid cunt has been posted here before. Almost all the content in his video is from this sub.  We have nothing to do with /r/TheRedPill as a sub. The funny bit is a true red piller would never make a video like that.  As about as pathetic as it gets.	27
1	Have these people never been around incoherently drunk college girls? There is nothing more annoying. It isnt hot, and I dont have the patience for that shit.	27

I know he means innocent in the legal sense, but two soldiers who come home on leave and double team this beautiful flower are not innocent.	27
1	What's wrong with more?	27
0	You disgusting human being.	27
1	Pretty sure the reason he didn't hit her was because of the dude double his size who appears very briefly in the video, not his upbringing.	27
1	Don't they have to break both your legs and let the bones regrow or something like that? That much money, that much pain, and I don't see it making you more than a couple inches taller... not worth it.	27
0	Would a guy be justified in pushing another man through a bunch of desks because he threw tea in his face?	27
0	Do you really think he just decided to hit her? You don't think for one second, before this video started recording, that she was pushing him and harassing him? Are you that dense. You really think she was in there minding her own sweet business not trying to start shit? If that's the case you're a moron. It's obvious she went in there with her friends trying to start shit. That's the reason she called on her friend when shit happened. Only thing is the friend realised they were fucking with the wrong guy and she didn't do shit.	27

0	Not the point. The point is that she didn't try to use her pussy pass. She's just a belligerent idiot. And the guy is an idiot too if he knew how shallow that canal is. Imagine she landed on her head and broke her neck?	27
1	What is wrong with her?! Signed. If the gender roles were reversed, that man would be ostracized and kicked from his job so hard.	27

0	&gt; the decades that each of them would have done if they had been found guilty  How are you not just making up stupid bullshit in your head? It's unlikely they would have served decades if they'd *murdered* her. It's completely ridiculous to suggest they'd get decades for rape. Jesus, [the maximum sentence](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/s3_sexual_assault/) is a decade. Christ, you're a lazy, dumb hack.	27

1	read this palm you gypsy bitch	27
1	Men do not ogle women because we're creeps. We do so because it's *natural* for us to do so. Noticing and observing are necessary first steps to finding a potential mate.  To be fair, most women already know this (of men); why else would they do their utmost to look their best at every turn? *They wish to be noticed*, eh?  This idiot is not going to overturn any biological urges and comes off as stupid and sanctimonious.	27
0	I couldn't agree more. It's mens fault that women think they can act this way.  Stop defending these stupid cunts just because you want to fuck them.	27

1	"You are ugly and you smell like shit" is the only proper response to that question, under the circumstances.	27

0	Wait, he can't copy and paste the text from another link, but you can?	27
1	I feel you. This woman is out of her mind though.   What if someone told her that short people have no "cure" against their height but overweight people do? Or that she is responsible for being overweight while short people are not for being short?	27

0	&gt; "I, an ethnic minority woman, cannot be racist or sexist towards white men because racism and sexism describe structures of privilege based on race and gender  I've heard this before, but usually as sarcastic parody of either opportunistic race warrior or genuinely misguided youth.  Firing her would just make her a martyr, not the answer. People need to get in the habit of dealing with this.  Also she looks like [Blackie Lawless](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/12/9c/bc/129cbcb1d7546e35862190c2ba9618cb.jpg) so that's funny.	27

1	Naw, you know she's cried her way out of stuff her entire life. It was her default reaction to being caught.	27
1	I knew a girl who used to delete my comments all the time. It's not my fault she didn't tune her guitar before posting videos of her singing	27
1	That moment when entitlement gets wiped from your face	27
0	5'5" guy here. Totally reasonable reaction for her to have. I feel somewhat similar about taller girls.  Also grew out of being insecure of my height by around 15 years old.   She should probably go for a jog though.	27
0	my family took care of that and i don't bend over to get my ass kissed. that a privileged act and one needs to put effort to bury their face in that golden spot, it's their desire if any... "mate" lol keep dreaming	27
0	Thats a fair point. I read this story right as it came out, not recently. However, I still think it is ridiculous to prosecute someone in a democracy for a political/social stance that was obviously hyperbolic. No matter how stupid that statement is. I agree she should be fired though.	27
1	Don't people realize they're hurting their cause way more than helping it when they make up bullshit like this?	27
0	But if two black women ran over a white man should it still be a hate crime? That's all I'm gettin at	27
0	It wasn't a criminal trial - you misunderstood the whole thing.  Yes, he was mad at the cops in the beginning and threatened to sue them.  He probably could have sued them for false arrest since they had no real probable cause, but that's debatable.  What happened was that the cops agreed to testify on his behalf in his CIVIL suits against the white knights and feminazis.	27
0	I still say he was sort of asking for it by suddenly getting right up in her face. Do you not see how that happens right before she spits on him?	27
1	Good idea. Until she calls the cops on your for 'spying' without consent and you become known as the 'pervy' 'creepy' campus peeping-tom. Remember, they made the rules so you can't win.	27

1	&gt; Black women straightening their hair trying to be white?  &gt; "Yeah, basically yes."  I quote a black friend of mine "Bitch, I straighten my hair because I like it fucking straightened, not because I am trying to be fucking white."	27
1	Found the butter huffer.	27
1	&gt;But on a serious note, yes, it is his fault "some cunt" tried to ruin his life. If he hadn't gotten drunk and fucked her, he wouldn't have been in this position.  Haha wow, you're a dumbass.  "Why'd you go outside? You wouldn't of been raped if you just stayed inside!" - your argument weighs as much as that one.   &gt;don't drink and fuck.  Thats some of the dumbest, most antisocial advice i've ever heard.	27
0	With your mom? Yep	27
1	She might have stepped on the persons hand.	27
0	It has a successful conviction rate because so few cases ever make it to trial. The only cases that get tried are ones with physical evidence, are promptly reported, and promptly investigated.   Trials make up 2% of rape police reports. And as wrong as it sounds, that's the way it has to be. There has to be evidence to toss someone into jail.  Let's not pretend that someone shows up, cries rape, and the accused automatically gets thrown in jail.	27
0	*That's* a great point, but he didn't present it that way. He  baited her with the "The greatest system in the world?" and had her in a corner when she refused to acknowledge that America is great. She could've held her ground and said "Yes, we should take responsibility for what is thus far the greatest system in the world." But she fell for the derailment. Because he's a master trole.	27

0	that's not in fph. any sign of fatness and you get banned. you are thinking of fps or fatlogic	27
0	I love these "I know my rights and I can do what I want" videos, these people don't seem to realize that regardless of the badge and the pledge to "serve the public" these are essentially a group of armed men. You have the rights they allow you have until you are safely away. I'm not saying thats right or ok but it is what it is.	27
1	Not sure if trolling- imprisoning someone for 20 years for a dimebag of pot fulfills your example- killing people, child molesters, that kinda stuff- my outrage at their imprisonment is significantly less	27
0	Nope, just a year spent as a teacher's aide. And some of the teachers were so pathetic. Kids would be dropping f bombs, getting in shoving and screaming matches, flashing gang signs etc and they would ignore it even though no one could get any work done.	27

0	It'll probably get removed so mirror it elsewhere too	27

1	Lot of guys don't understand this and think alimony is all bad. While in many (most?) Cases it certainly is unjust, there are still many cases in which alimony is fair, both when the man or woman is paying or receiving.  No house body (the spouse that chooses to stay home and raise children) should be cast out onto the street when things go sour. It is a joint decision for that person (in most cases) to be the stay at home parent.  They are entitled to some financial support so they can get a job and support them self.	27
1	He's not wrong. You exposed your bias. Own up to it.	27

0	Her story was true. This has been posted before.	27
1	Because all women aren't like that, not even fucking close. Many more fat people have that characteristic than do women.  This is a decent sub, but I question my subscription when it turns into flat-out hate for all women. Why does anyone want to read that, are they THAT fucking bitter? I come here to see people denied at attempts to abuse special privilege, not to be a general misogynist.	27

Your reasoning is completely valid, and is basically the same as my post, which I see now will get downvoted into oblivion because how dare anyone suggest that there's a difference of opinion.  Better get rid of it, based on emotional knee-jerk reactions rather than discuss it and examine it logically.  Fucking hypocrites.	27

1	Also 11:05 Pirro just gets down to business.   I kind of feel bad for the girl, not only is she dumb enough to accuse him of forced intercourse (on the first day of a 4-5 month relationship no less) but she does not articulate herself well and thinks a court room is an appropriate place to attack the guy.   I would agree that its slander/libel (online source?) Because he had a very real and substantial consequence from her post.	27
1	Topics aside, this literally boils down to "You hurt my friend's feelings because she hurt your feelings. You're an asshole." How can people not see the irony in this? This could go down as an example in the dictionary of irony.	27

[Meanwhile:](https://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/dnaevid.txt)  &gt; "Every year since 1989, in about 25 percent of the sexual assault cases referred to the FBI where results could be obtained (primarily by State and local law enforcement), the primary suspect has been excluded by forensic DNA testing."	27

0	Keep going to the bottom jackass	27
1	I think he meant to reference the, "don't do more than you have to" rule here. It doesn't really apply, it's not like he knocked her down and stomped her or hit her multiple times.	27

1	Fucking right my dude!!!!! Equal rights.......and lefts.	27
1	I don't exactly see the PP here. They committed a murder, didn't try to say they should be fine because they are woman, and they got charged.  Seems like /r/justiceporn to me.	27
1	I would love for someone to pay for me to stay home and take care of any kids I have. I think it's far more of a sacrifice to have to toil away at a job and consequently spend minimal time with your children.	27

But what do you expect from fuckers who still worship "royalty" in 2015.  That little bitch needs to grow a fucking pair and knock the little cunt out.  I thought the french were an effeminate lot, the british aren't any better.	27

1	Not only is this a double standard but on top of that you can do something about your weight BUT NOT ABOUT YOUR FUCKING HEIGHT    this shit really makes me angry	27
1	I get that she's pissed and all, but she's not using her vagina to further any agenda or use as a handicap. She's just mad that schools like to cash in on diversity whereas she was a straight academic shooter.

Always take the trained athlete over the zero conditioning person in any platform. There is so much false info in this thread regarding strength and body mass it's laughable.   Although I'm sure the guy you replied to is laughably stupid lean body mass is a thing. It's just the ratio of fat in your body, but that's it. Doesn't means a thing for fighting or most anything really.	27

1	&gt;I, an ethnic minority woman, cannot be racist or sexist towards white men because racism and sexism describe structures of privilege based on race and gender and therefore women of colour and minority genders cannot be racist or sexist, since we do not stand to benefit from such a system.  Translation:  I'm a member of a cult that chooses to define the words "racism" and "sexism" differently than the commonly accepted definition of those words.  According to the actual definition of those words, I'm actually a massive racist and sexist scumbag.	27
1	He should sue those cunts for millions of dollars and every single one of them should get at least the same amount of sentence than he did. But i can fucking guarantee justice is going to happen because all of them will get a major pussypass.	27

0	I'm not going to do your research for you when you keep making completely incorrect points. You feel free to prove my cited assertions incorrect. I'm guessing you learned your logic in public schools.  You can Google and get the median salary. You can then make whatever arbitrary distinctions you like from it. You have cited nothing.	27
1	&gt; Don’t you think I would have gotten in trouble with the police for making this up? Even if I went to the police and made the entire story up, the police can do a better job of working out liars than some dude on the Internet.           Of course.	27
1	Yeah I don't know, the wage gap has been debunked so many times I'm not sure how it's still a part of feminism.  Kind of says a lot about a movement when every issue they bring up is debunked and proven bullshit.	27

But on a serious note, yes, it is his fault "some cunt" tried to ruin his life. If he hadn't gotten drunk and fucked her, he wouldn't have been in this position.  It's very simple.

It was thrown out quickly because of my co operation, honesty- im joking that didnt help. My lawyer did his job well. And i couldnt sue her for false claims because the lawyer didnt want to have feminists picket his office. He didnt say that, but thats what i got from his answer.	27

0	Saying diet soda is healthy is silly. Soda is not healthy.  Wanna be healthy?  Chill with the sweet drinks. Chill with the processed foods.  Diet sodas have more processed artificial crap than regular shitty sodas.  I think that pure cane sugar is better for you than artificial sweeteners that trick your tastebuds and then your digestive system.  It makes yr body react in unintended ways - it expects sugar/glucose/fructose and gets aspartame or sucralose and your body doesn't know what to do with it.  Bullshit it's better for you.  Just lay off The fat people drinks and you'll be less fat.	27
1	With all the publicity that may very well be her last boyfriend, she will need to change her name and lose all that weight if she want's another when she gets out of the slammer, but she's too fat to put forth the effort anyway.	27

0	Oh, not at all. I'm not defending this woman, she's a fat, ugly, racist cunt and I don't feel bad about seeing her get slapped. But this guy didn't just record her, he continually engaged her, and that can be used as an excuse of provocation.	27
0	A lot of students do not think that. A 4.5 GPA is not hard to get or maintain, and a lot of students graduate with that and still do not get into their top colleges since many students are qualified with their GPA but not ECs.

And maybe force cops to have a badge or patch added to their uniforms as well so if they ever try to stop someone from filming the victim can point to the cops own uniform as proof that it is legal.	27
1	Damn.... he let a lot slide.	27
1	I got suspended in high school for fighting back (and winning) after a kid sucker punched me. The assistant principle said they had zero tolerance, and that if I didn't want to be suspended I should have not fought back. My dad who was obviously frustrated and on my side, asked the assist principal if he reached over the desk right now and punched him in the face, wouldn't he fight back? There was a long awkward silence before he repeated that I was still suspended. School system is full of corrupt cowards.	27

0	the fact is she's not even worried: she does not try to run or to keep her distances from him.  I would, if I just pulled off something like that... even to a friend of mine...  what would you do if you jokingly punch a friend from the back? just stand there or protect yourself/take a step back/run away?	27
0	But if I wish all politicians were to be die simultaneously, I'm a terrorist, right?	27
0	No, he's threatening the kid with kidnapping and theft. The judge does not deserve respect. The judge lives off of the money forcefully taken from other people. A real judge can get people to pay him without using the violence of the state to collect his wages.	27

0	F'ed this up a bit ago. Trying again.  I'm up in the air as to whether this is an attempt at a pussypass. He definitely doesn't seemed concerned about her gender. Seems a strong possibility. You tell me.	27

0	She wasn't detained. She had every right to leave, every opportunity to leave, and was ultimately ordered to leave and she refused. You might not like it but you don't have a right to drive and you don't have fettered access to the roads.  She was fucking with the cops, not the other way around. They didn't drag her out of her car and shoot her. She walked up to two cops, started running her mouth and got shut down.  The world isn't out to get you. Turn off the Fox News every once in a while.  Reality hits you hard bro.	27

1	She says society is sexist &amp; objectifies women, yet her blouse is unbuttoned and you can see her bra and big cleavage. She even got two revolver tats directly on her cleavage. She made the choice to do this to draw attention to her breasts. She objectified herself. If she says its the white patriarchy that brainwashed her to do it, she's admitting SHES NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HER OWN CHOICES WHATSOEVER. She's either a woman making her own decisions or she's a mumbling slave controlled by the "influences" of the culture. You can't be both.	27

I just don't want to make the effort. Too much work and and not enough return. It took some time to accept that there is no Mrs. AugmentedFury out there, my ideal woman doesn't exist. With that said it's been fine. I have to worry about other things besides women.	28

1	It was too recent to report any significant change. But it helped shrug of a depression that was not going away with meds (they made it worse) or therapy (feminized bullshit pseudo-science).   Edit: I am not saying not to do therapy if you are depressed. But from what I have seen, therapist tend to downplay female bad behavior (calling psychopathic behavior [BPD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder)) and encouraging you to play by society's rules and get a girlfriend - which *could* be a good thing in times of old.	28

1	Feminism must be seen as a defensive position for some women that explains why they dont have relationships and validates them rather than dealing with the fact that they have let themselves become unattractive to the opposite sex. Not that all feminist are in this condition physically but Id say it fits those that fit the description.	28
1	Errrr---ahhhhhhh---- I have to respectfully disagree. A dog seems to get the "pecking order" fairly quickly, and once he/she learns it-- which doesn't take long-- you have a faithful friend for the life of the animal. Women seem to be far more mercurial, even the best of them aren't fully to be trusted from what I gather.	28

0	From Macleans, an "American" news source.   &gt; Last Friday, Bill C-36, the new federal anti-prostitution legislation that criminalizes those who buy sex (known as “the perverts” to Justice Minister Peter Mackay) officially came into force. (The timing was unfortunate as it coincided with the national day of action for violence against women.)  &gt;Under the new law, it’s also illegal to “knowingly advertise an offer to provide sexual services” and get “material benefit” from the sale of sex.   http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/roundup-canadians-respond-to-the-new-prostitution-law/	28

0	&gt; you are a fucking idiot  lol says the mgtow   seriously, mgtows are like among the dumbest people on the face of the planet. do you even *read* this forum? look at it. it's like a bunch of beetle-browed, blithering village idiots got together and formed a sub around their collective fear of women.  I'll be over here with my grad degree and my successful relationships and my total lack of neuroses if you want to talk. I could help you out, you know. That is, if you aren't afraid to admit literally all of the problems that led you to become mgtow are your fault.	28
0	MGTOW is interesting, but it is still grounded in complaining about females. complaining means playing the victim, and giving up your power. It seems like a lot of work and energy spent trying to change other people and get sympathy.	28
1	Get a vasectomy early and single. Woman aren't happy about it, but that's their problem, not yours.	28
1	This. I also felt superior when I was getting laid a lot. It only caused me to disgust myself later. Good thing that you realized that you don't need to be an asshole to be a man. Good thing too that you took care of your body and eating. That ultimately benefits yourself. Whatever you chose to do in the future, you are informed and free.	28
0	Imo uniqueness doesn't exist. Not in a society that mass produces in a uniform way everything from entertainment to clothing to food, and beyond. Even behavioral patterns are more uniform among people than unique.   We each have individual taste and style, but I'd say humans are far from being unique from one another.	28
1	&gt; The only thing sadder than a slave is a slave that not only thinks he's free but that he's the master.  Or as I heard it said by someone recently *"the beggar who foolishly thinks he's the chooser".*	28
0	You know how I know you're very much in preacher mode? Because you took my replies to an obvious troll seriously. The truth is you have all your sermons rehearsed and ready to go. You were just looking for an opportunity to preach and you found it here. Look at how easy it is to bait you. This tells me you are grotesquely insecure which is borne out of fear.   Now if you excuse me I feel like a little bit of misogyny right now. Maybe a touch of racism too.   Man it feels good to hate!  "I rest my case"   No you don't.   You'll be back.	28
1	Has nothing to do with justice. It is women crying wolf too many times (rape) and women choosing abusive partners and staying with such in spite of the abuse. Women fantasize about rape and love abusive men. That is gospel truth. There are enough people, politicians and tax dollars available to care about women.   Now I think you need to water your horse, white knight motherfucker.	28

The only ones around her are the mgtows (because they haven't been robed, raped and drained of their soul yet)` because Im in a satisfying 4 year relationship and we are very much in love, thank you very much. I could not give a fuck about finding eligible bachelors.  Im just curious and thought you might have something interesting to share.	28

0	the point is when you are done with women, you are done   i mean really done... and done is done.   you don't waste your time crying over them and about them... you go and live your life.  you just accept that things are the way they are, and you choose to be the way you want to be independent of the way things are.  this is emotional freedom, and self control, and both are prerequisites for being an adult male.	28

1	Shes attractive enough to still garner interest but is a horrible person in real life so the men who show genuine romantic interest at least in part because of her looks spend one date with her and go from "NAWALT? No, AWALT" and walk away.  The second type are the quick lay guys who were lured in because shes a slutty retard leading on in her profile and they think "easy pussy" and when they get on the date they realize shes an entitled princess that expects them to work for 35 year old snatch.	28
0	I'm not offended. I find it part of the questionable direction that MGTOW is going in.	28
0	im not angry at all, so what makes you think i am?	28
1	I thought that too. Ahhh what might have been! No sooner did she have my last name than she managed to get fired from her job-- she blamed her supervisor but 20/20 hindsight tells me she was more likely fired for gross insubordination. She never even tried to look for another job, and as far as I know was still unemployed the day the divorce became final.  Good luck, you're gonna need it.	28
0	Lol I already know the answer to that but I'll try.	28
0	From the Globe and Mail, another "American" purveyor of propaganda.   &gt; The bill criminalizes the buying of sex – or “obtain[ing] for consideration… the sexual services of a person.” The penalties include jail time – up to five years in some cases – and minimum cash fines that go up after a first offence.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canadas-new-prostitution-laws-everything-you-need-to-know/article19610318/?service=mobile  I find that guys who profess to know it all are often easily made fools.	28

1	Thats a bs fluff article.  She said it herself, shes banging 22 yo's on tinder every week.  And shes fine with that. Of course shes always single, none of those guys are going to commit to her.

1	As i've posted before, the Youtube channel, Feminism LOL, is run by a woman. Of course she's fairly intelligent and doesn't want feminism to go too far and lose ground, but she states in one of her videos that to find the attention whores in any male dominated group; you look for the women that do not add anything to the subject and only repeat information that has already been stated by others. Women can add to male spheres, and the woman that runs Feminism LOL, has quite a bit of good, thought provoking videos. You just have to notice when you're watching an attention whore.	28

0	I am not insulting people for having a different outlook or opinion; I am insulting people who cannot communicate in a clear, concise manner.    Heck, I wouldn't even mind if every post was another guy telling his sob story so long as he respected the English language and explained what drove him to his epiphany. What I cannot stomach in ANY thread are people who post textwalls that are so poorly proofread as to be nigh illegible.    Make your point and share your grief if you so desire, gents - just do so in a manner that doesn't come across like the Facebook wailings of women scorned.	28

1	I thought that guy was intelligent at first and thus knew those embryos should never see the light of day, but if you read till the end, the idiot gave up his principles for $400.  He chose a short term gain of **FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS** over his financial freedom in the long run.    Shes making such a big deal about how she was victorious and will never need to see that scumbag again, but as soon as the children are born she will be back at his doorstep and demand child support.  This time the courts will be on **HER** side.  What a fucking idiot.	28
1	Mine too. She had 3 kids and got child support for each of us. After I was 18 and not living in her house (I actually never lived with her, and she never supported me) or being supported by her at all, I never saw a DIME of that money that was supposed to be for me going to school.   Then my brother moved out and she kept child support going for him and made him go to classes for a few weeks to make it look like he was in school so she would keep getting child support money.	28

1	Funny thing about that is that one reason men go to Brazil-- specifically Rio-- is that the women there have a rather loose reputation. About the other thing--- seems like a lot of us have had the "pleasure" of having to deal with a violent, crazy woman. They hide it so well until they've got you hooked--- then all hell breaks loose as soon as she thinks her victim is trapped.	28
0	artsy women? well maybe they should figure out they can save money by cutting on alcohol and weed ;))	28
0	1) Thank you for nullifying your own previous statement.   2) Prenups are routinely thrown out of court, fool. Even lawyers know they aren't worth the paper they're on. They can say she was coerced into signing.   3) Because you think like a woman. All emotion, zero logic.   4) You can't suggest counselling without diagnosing, fool. Otherwise, I'd need counselling for eating and sleeping.   Your rationalization and thought process mirrors that of every female I've talked to. Good luck with that, mangina.	28
1	Guy needs to have a SHITLOAD more practice on his own theme -- he comes across as weak, apologetic, and pretty much ball-less... I mean good god, he's *stuttering.*  No offense to guys who stutter, but it is something they CAN overcome -- takes a lot of effort but it can be done -- and if they are **intending/planning** to do this kind of (prime time public-TV "spokesman") stuff, then it's something they need to manage ahead of time.	28

1	She looks like Mrs Doubtfire	28
1	Lol.   In case you didn't notice, she's was a US pilot.   Still, since we're what protects Canada, you're right that incompetent women in the US military are a threat to you.   As for the Muslims ... your immigration policy is on you.	28
1	She's so crazy she would probably lie to police that he had raped her if he tried to break up with her.    He's in a tough position.	28

0	IT'S LEGAL. I can get one legally RIGHT NOW.  I do write carefully enough: as it's always been, you pay for TIME and no crime is committed by this act. A consenting adult couple alone together may, if they want, do what they want, including sex, and that's legal. That's also prostitution.	28

0	Traditionalism is the best option we got. Feminism and egalitarianism destroys society. Traditionalism upholds the family unit. How should we deal with women in the future? I don't know of any other option besides the traditional patriarchal standard unless you have a better option.	28
1	From what I've read it's Canada, Australia, the US and the UK that are the worst, presumably because of the growth of feminism combined with a popular culture which encourages vapid materialism and zero responsibility for women.  Feminism is huge in Scandinavia as well but their culture values more than just the Kardashians, so while it's bad, it's not quite as bad as the four nations I mentioned specifically.	28

0	It's not a coincidence that you can't take criticism and also want to withdraw from a huge subset of social interaction + society.	28
0	I have to say, I'm not really even against this hiring of women into positions in academia because they are teachers and role models, and I think having a diverse staff helps encourage people from all walks of life pursue STEM degrees. Just because women are hired at a 2:1 ratio doesn't mean that there are currently 2:1 women being hired. It's still overwhelmingly male.   I just wish feminists would drop their victim complex and have a rational discussion instead of defaulting to woe is me narratives whenever possible.	28

1	Yes but my BB friend in question KNOWS about mgtow and TRP and still goes with this charade. He even lambasted his mgtow uncle calling him a loser. The hamster is strong in this one. The sad part is that he stays with his GF bc they have history together with their families but she's a useless american white girl (bartender, STD, slutty past, flirty with any alpha in the vicinity).   So yeah fuck him.	28
1	I don't understand why every time you disagree with a feminist on an issue they take it as a personal attack.	28
1	Vice.com is a SJW circle jerk.  They got that domain name to fool people into thinking they are so edgy and bad-ass.  But they really just latch on to whatever is the hot "cause célèbre" of the week.  Too bad a porn company didn't grab the domain name first.	28

0	Why don't these guys just adopt kids? Going their route seems selfish, especially since they're getting old.	28
0	Yeh, they are quick to blast a guy.  Try looking at the laws on the book where you are.  I was flabbergasted that men here could be arrested merely on hearsay, because that is a major violation of the Constitution.  But I guess men lose their inalienable rights to "protect the women"	28
0	im confused I just wanted to know if yall would hate me if I was here	28
0	I agree wholeheartedly and if anything I said was taken as contradictory, I retract it and replace it with what this guy said.    MGTOW doesn't have to mean celibacy or antipathy towards women, just the freedom from feeling compelled to partner up because it's what you're "supposed to do".  Men AND women can each live perfectly fulfilling lives without a SO.	28
0	Hell no. Women lower productivity dramatically and lower the wages of men. The job market would be much more stable with the absence of women.	28
0	lol wow.   i wonder what your life is like. you're so bitter and obviously very depressed. i feel bad for you.	28

0	Excellent point. He's not the easiest kid to talk to, very quiet and introverted... basically he's an awkward teen (yeah, I just made an excuse). His dykier mom says he wants a male influence, and wants to learn man skills, like vehicle maintenance, but he has never said anything of the sort directly to me. That's all I really know about what he wants.	28
0	bahaha no i am quite male. God's second mistake? You would prefer not existing? This is why prostitution should be legal, because when a guy doesn't get his knob polished for a long time he turns into a raving lunatic who blames a group of people for his personal problems.

1	lol the internet is hard on WOMEN? you've got to be joking, the internet is hard on EVERYONE.  Women are not immune to anonymous critics saying mean things on the internet, men shrug that shit off, as should everyone.	28
0	You're pretty much admitting you have social problems if you can't understand the point that bonding with a woman is a positive experience and that it elevates sex from some boring, mechanical thing similar to masturbation to a more social, exciting thing.  I haven't used prostitutes, but I have had sex very fast with women who were practically strangers. The sex was way worse than having sex with a girlfriend of even a few weeks.	28
0	&gt;Is it possible for women to change their behavior as described by MGTOW? If so, what would need to change?  The guys who subscribe to this immature philosophy would need to grow up and stop acting like bitter butthurt nerds who don't get any attention from women. *BUT*, it is easier to blame every single woman on the planet for their problems. Because blaming billions of people is easier than looking in the mirror and being honest with yourself.  You want advice? Don't listen to anything these failures have to say.	28
0	Who says they're not? I don't see anything in the sidebar that says otherwise. Maybe it's certainly not mandatory, but how do you plan to achieve success of the stated goals by disregarding men's rights? No one said kissing anyone's ass, I said tolerate. If you can't do that then maybe part of the problem is with you. And I'm not too worried what someone thinks I should do when they have to use a throwaway account just to GTOW. Whatever buddy.	28

1	It seems to me that you have a warrior spirit. I respect this and hope that you always follow your personal way in life.  I'm proud of having gone through several mental battles and a lot of tough and lonely circumstances in my life which all made me to the person that I am right now. I'm grateful that I didn't give up at any time and didn't end my life when things were way to much for me.	28
0	The pussification of the American male.	28
0	&gt; We're not actually happy, we're just pretending to be happy that we're MGTOW  I don't even pretend to be happy. Learn and accept about all these is not a pill easily swallowed at all. But then, it wouldn't be the first harsh true that I've learned about existence. The more I know about humans, the more I like my dog. To exist sucks and the sooner I accept it, the easier it gets. Call it "dark budhism" or something.  Now I survive through sarcasm and silly humor. That is how I manage my sanity.	28
1	Hit the nail on the head there. If they *were* so confident with themselves, they would not be shoving it in our faces with the "LOOK AT ME! LOOK HOW CONFIDENT I AM WITH MYSELF! THIS IS A REAL WOMAN. LOOK!!".   Make no mistake, they *despise* themselves deep down. They've tried every fad worthless diet (without ever actually putting in any real effort mind you). And they give up. Because they're too dam lazy. They're too dam greedy. They're too dam worthless. Thats the truth. And they will never admit it.	28
1	I needed that today lol.	28
0	You can have whatever theory you want about the weaknesses in each gender and how to behave, but if you want to have kids in a "normal" way, a romantic relationship is the only route.	28
1	Or maybe the modern woman is a spoiled brat.  Maybe it's that simple.	28
0	Who said I cared?	28
0	Yeah, that's what i noticed! Why are there fucking bitch's trolling on here, they need to go and fuck off!	28
1	worst thing I ever did to get sex:  trust.  Man, I'll never do that again. Caution is the watchword from now on.  Going to strange places to have sex: I don't care. I go to strange places to do *everything* so my motto on that is be aware, armed &amp; prepared with an exit plan. That's just life.  True though, a good wank means no risk of crazy chicks, false rape claims or even just normal bullshit attitude women have, just to get your rocks off.	28
0	&gt; If you smell like skunk, some chicks dont mind at all.  If you get stuck in a tight corner, burping and/or farting theatrically is worth a shot...	28
0	Pretty sure the UN doesn't call a social democratic nation whose economy is clearly capitalist "socialist."  Also pretty sure they aren't hysterical and acting like it's [white genocide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zMzeKBEvaQ) because Muslims are immigrating.	28
0	And if u don't believe me ask ur dadd	28
1	It is very weird to me that women view "banging" men as a bragging right. While many men have the luxury to be picky now-a-days, there are still droves of men who will jump at the chance to stick it in any hole a woman offers. From my perspective, I would rather know how often she actually orgasms from these sessions (if at all). I would like to know if she feels used or validated when a 22 year old cums in her and never calls again. I would like to know if she feels accomplished for doing something rather easy and mundane.	28
0	Again with the insults and calling out such behaviour you resorted to insults AGAIN!   Tell me dude do you really think I should take anything you say seriously? If I was speaking that way to you how would you react.   Here's a good thought for next time INSULTING the poster pretty much negates any point you made, because well quite frankly I'm not interested in reading or listening to anything else you say after that. Doing it again reduces you down to at best an immature troll.  Pretty much going to ignore anything else you say if you do it again, CLEAR?	28
1	If you are in a public place and get attacked by a woman you should just run. Seriously. There is no way that you get out of there in one piece if you try to defend yourself. You are on your own.  If she follows you alone you can fuck her up in a quiet side street and go on with your business. If white-knights chase you then you should run a couple of blocks around a corner and ask some people for help. They don't know that a female is involved and will most likely try helping you.	28
1	I think that came from a Hillary speech.. Even most women think that is stupid.	28
0	The acceptance and even promotion of using escorts in the MGTOW scene is getting a bit out of hand imho.   Please keep in mind that using escorts is a direct wealth transfer of men to women solidifying hypergyny. You are paying for something that she is not only getting for free, but even paid to do.  Not wise imho. Same goes for cam whores, paying for porn, strip clubs and so on.	28
0	&gt;There probably are gay MGTOWs  Wtf are you talking about????? Gay people aren't straight people.  &gt;so they should be welcome here  Why don't you go to a gay community and tell them you identify with some shit that they're going through with relationships because you're straight and you "understand." Become an advice guru for homosexuals too. When you're celebrated as the straight king of your local gay community, come back and tell Reddit all about it.  I don't think you fully understand what MGTOW is, dude.	28
1	So Zimbardo thinks we ought to look at how men are opting out, but now why (factors such as: false rape allegations, society's view of men as toxic would-be rapists, the general gynocentric roots of civilization, the realities of marriage as a futile slave contract, financial rape, etc.).  Let's debate the effects, but not examine the causes.  Sounds like an articulate diagnostic dissection to me.	28
1	They are better at it and also allowed to get away with it all their lives	28
0	Best line regarding it.   "it interferes with my mental abilities"  "so does a bullet through the head"	28
0	I'd like to see your scientific data backing up your claim.  My scientific data is my body. I have 17.5 inch arms, and I can bench 250+, deadlift 300+ and squat 300+ and I've lost 110 lbs of fat since I started lifting.  Go to any reputable body building website, ask any certified trainer, ask any bodybuilder, they will say the same things I'm saying. There's a reason why chicken is so popular with muscle heads, it's because it's low fat and high protein, meaning that you can get a lot of protein without exceeding a 2000-2500 calorie limit.	28
0	Sexual companionship goes beyond the sex of the people involved. Why do you focus on vagina? Men having sex with men, when they have that urge, is just as important and fulfilling as men having sex with women. It's normal social interaction.	28
0	&gt; beta males  lol you literally think of people in terms of 19th century zoology.  so if guys who get laid are betas and alphas, does that make you an omega?  &gt;While alphas and MGTOW enjoy their lives.   you sound bitter. I also think it's funny that you liken yourself to an "alpha."	28
0	im surprised your butt gets hurt so easily, since you prefer to surround yourself with men.	28
0	Nah, i thought about it once but it just didn't appeal to me. It's mostly me just having a boring/easy job.	28
0	Going MGTOW is a step some take, usually after going through all TRP phases, so just chill out, go study TRP, and then make your decisions.  Also, learn how to use punctuation.	28
0	You should create a post with these and more details. I have one smaller experiment that I could post there as a reply.	28
1	Not so sure about that. Muslim men are basically groomed to be simps. they believe paradise is at the feet of the mother, and mother is 4 times more important then fathers plus how women are jewels that need to be protected and hidden from view. Dont let muslim women feeling oppressed fool you, they are taking full advantage of the situation	28

1	I guess it depends what you consider plus size. According to UK sizing I would be like a size 10-12 (5'6, 135 lb, 34C-27-38) and I wouldn't consider myself overweight (maybe height is a good consideration though, since I'm about 2" taller then most women). Here's [reference](http://imgur.com/QZkNmTJ) (sorry for the angle - it's few months old as I'm now 9 months pregnant).

I can't count the number of dudes with huge guts on fancy bikes who I'll be passing on a climb and immediately start saying stuff like "oh this is my first time riding this way" or "I've been riding for three hours already!" Lol, I don't give a fuck and trying to justify yourself to a total stranger who you'll only see for 15 seconds doesn't make you any less pathetic.	30
0	&gt; As a black guy I can sadly confirm this. The men of my race have 0 standards as long as they can get arse. I'm so proud my woman still keeps her abs.  The black guy above me confirms this. Fuck off, person who can't read. Unless you want to call a black man racist. But black people can't be racist, remember? Racism = power+prejudice or whatever bullshit it is nowadays. Checkmate, theists.	30
0	The guy did lose weight, i'm just giving a reason he could have been fat.  I don't get why we hate former fatties that now actually post here, they know it's bad to be fat now.	30

0	She's not even fat, shes barely on the chubby scale. Admittedly, i have no idea who this was and googled her but i took a long hard look and she seems to be at a healthy weight. Can anybody provide any evidence to prove me wrong?	30

1	From the article, "The operation to cut into her home, which came after she telephoned her mother to say she couldn't stand up, cost emergency workers an estimated £100,000. "   That's the cost of getting her out of her home ONE FUCKING TIME.	30

0	Did you forget a /s or are looking to get banned?	30
1	Actually what happens is they use a heated cutting tool (like a hot knife) so that it "burns" through the skin. Trust me, obese people smell up the OR worse than anyone.	30

0	Let's not miss the third from the left.   edit: I am getting downvotes. I don't usually get an influx of downvotes, which makes me believe the people in this sub are responsible. If you're downvoting me, you need to reevaluate what you're doing here. That chick is overweight. Look at her waist. Unfortunately, we have been infiltrated by a bunch of overweight people who think they are average or fit, and seem to think that chick is of a healthy bmi. You pig fuckers disgust me.	30
0	A ham isn't "technically overweight" just like a bulimic isn't "technically underweight". 17 and 35 bmi's don't mean the same thing when someone says unhealthy.	30

1	THIS is how the fatties get fat. It isn't mainly portion control or overeating (while it can be that, look at the best competitive eaters. They're usually either swole or skinny). It's the soda and the Beetusbux. The liquid empty calories that just add nothing to you. Only type of soft drink I'll even have is a root beer to treat myself during a special occasion (birthday, holiday, etc). Besides that it's water for me. Soda and other sugary liquid garbage is the main contributor to fat and weight gain.	30

1	I love how when they have these events the most professional photos they can find are their god damn tumblr selfies. It's exactly like how all the fat people on LinkedIn use selfies.	30
1	I'm still amazed that things like gay beatings take place. Had a friend come out to us at a hardcore conservative church, and the worst reaction he got was, "hmm I'm not sure how I feel about it, but it's not really my business anyway, we still love you." Is this sort of thing common?	30
1	&gt; They want to be her – but they can't  Worse. They want to be her and they can but they choose to keep piling food into the gaping eating chasm in their lard.	30
0	While the girl on the left may not be anorexic, she definitely doesn't look healthy. I hate how the beauty industry actively wants rail thin girls to wear their cloths and walk in front of people looking so shitty. That's not sexy or in anyway appealing you idiots.	30
1	Ugh deluxe dining plan. Went with the shitlady and her parents, I don't think I've ever eaten so much dessert in my life. Not that I'm a food snob, I just legit don't have a sweet tooth. Every lunch and dinner I'd get a $5 hunk of cake or something that I'd have to take a few bites of to be polite, since we'd already paid for it.	30

1	I hate fat gamers. Pisses me off. Get out of your goddamn chair and go do something worthy with your life. I especially hate fat girl gamers that constantly bitch about their weight and wear "slutty" (more disgusting than it is slutty) outfits while streaming or recording to get more viewers.

0	I was at a restaurant with some friends once, and they had those aluminum chairs are welded together, and one of them I guess had a bad weld in it, and after a minute or two of sitting on it, the weld gave, and the chair collapsed.  I'm a pretty big guy, shoulders are 52 inches around, my waist is about 36.  Even when the weld broke, I basically just fell down to the ground.  But this dude, he fucking shatters the chair. There's not even any structural damage to begin with!	30
1	Did you actually read the article? The third sentence says that any "escape" from the hazards of obesity is temporary.	30
1	Also, with all of that muscle mass, she can probably eat a bit more than pre six pack.  But it looks like anorexia to dr. Fat shit	30
0	If she left a tip it may have covered the cost. While I agree with the Uber driver a person more suitable to break this sort of news to her would be a doctor you feel me?  Edit: After further analysis I believe that those whom replied to me did not feel me. I am however going to stand by what I said and stay true to my word. Keep those down votes coming, you all have an opinion which I'm willing to listen to.	30

0	Why? You're just adding like 2 pounds of fat to your body. What's the point of cutting if you just immediately fuck it up in one day of retarded eating?	30
1	I walked into the local mcdees this nice afternoon and was met with appalling this  thing muttling on about how dumb the employees at the mcdonalds were. Apparently he wanted 2 large cups of soda to go along with his condishuns but was mistakenly given just one cup, simple error to be corrected. But he had to make a big show and scene of it. I was very glad the beetus had taken its legs away to beetusland.   If you notice,  his special wheel chair is like a double wide. Won't  be  long now for this one.	30
0	&gt;I wonder how many pounds?  &gt;Not that long with a proper diet.  :-p  But I generally agree.	30
0	I stand corrected, though you wont find me drinking a 375ml can of coke that has 40grams of sugar in it.	30
1	This applies to literally any size comparison. If you have a gut, your arms/legs/tits/ass isn't "big", it's "fat".  That's how this shit works.	30
0	do hams even physics?	30
0	I don't know about you but this post makes more sense to me in this context   From the 16th century "to eat one's own heart" (to suffer in silence from anguish or grief), possibly from the Bible "to eat one's own flesh" (to be lazy) The phrase "to eat one's heart out" appears as a formulaic phrase in the Iliad, meaning to experience extreme grief.	30
1	I would say that in her case genetics is what's responsible for her hip to waist ratio, as plenty of fit women are less extremely hour glass shape. But that'd be about it.	30
0	I thought the jokes were pretty funny myself. But I'm dead serious. You look like you need help, and the fact you try and make yourself feel better by 'humiliating' other people about their weight is just as concerning as your physique. You realize it works both ways right? Like super fat people are just as unattractive as super abnormally skinny people.. right? There's a good saying about people in glass houses not throwing stones..	30

1	It shouldn't have let itself become such a fat fuck in the first place. Any progress that you think you see is due solely to gravitational lensing.	30
1	Those types of comments on pics of fit women are just so pathetic. We all know that those comments come from either jealous fat bitches or butthurt jealous low tier men who hate anybody who's out of their league.	30
0	Came here to say those poor bunnies look like they'll be scarred for life	30
1	To me, those people are no different than feeders. One does it for some fucked up sexual gratification, the other does it to keep the money rolling in. I think I get angrier at those kinds of scum even more than fat people, because they themselves are rarely that fucking big, so clearly they know it's unhealthy but are pushing it anyway. Fucking degenerates encouraging suicide by burger.	30

It's very difficult to get abs that defined and damn, she worked hard for it. I don't know why they keep saying she looks like she HASNT eaten, considering you need to eat twice as much to get that much muscle. Wtf. Fat logic.	30

1	Why on earth do so many fat people have a wide array of sporting accessories? It seems like there's a fat person discount for them because I swear, on a normal public transport day every overweight person has a Nike, Adidas, Underarmour, Puma, whatever bag or leggings, shorts or shirts.    I need a decent midsized bag for school and sport gear. I never thought I'd say this but I'm envious of a fat persons budget. -_-   OP, I'm the same height but rockin an extra 15lbs on you, you look fabulous. Keep that up!	30
1	You thought it smelled dank before...	30
0	I've been eclipsed before so that's a very real possibility	30
0	And I'm totally fine with your preferences.  Women are meant to have higher a higher body fat percentage than men, or else their hormonal balance gets out of wack and suddenly, among other thing, their periods stop as their body is basically telling them that can't support creating life form (which is what distinguishes them from men).  P.S. I would like to say thanks to all the haters on my OP.	30

1	Hypocritical as shit. Every woman is beautiful and healthy... Unless you're skinny. Or Average. Or just kinda fat. Or trying to lose weight.	30
1	That weight kills her entire skeletal system.   I heard a landwhale complaining about their back one day and about how they don't understand why it hurts so badly. I was just awestruck that someone could be that fat and stupid at the time, I've learned a lot from that day though.   I hope to live in a world one day soon that fats don't get treatment for something that someone else needs more because of something they can't control, like height or an actual disease.	30

0	&gt;How can SO MANY people be ok with that?  Cheap, shitty, abundant food + fat acceptance  + technology replacing manual labor + excuses + depression=America.	30
1	Know what all those guys have in common?  They can see their genitals.	30
0	That one on the left isn't helping the cause either.	30
0	Thank God I study physics	30
1	Fucking Freds - the biggest lowlife oxygen theives ever. She's lucky she was his first reality check, I bet the next day (if he had the courage and maturity to face humiliation again) he would have verbally abused the non-ham that overtook him	30
0	She just always wanted to look like a fat Maisie Williams.	30
1	So are [furries](http://www.cringechannel.com/2015/03/10/picture-just-a-typical-walmart-employee/)  They seem to all be in the same overlapping circle of fetishes	30
1	Pretty sure it's a diarrhea shitstain running down his asscrack, down the bus stop seat, and puddling onto the ground.  Yeah.	30
1	Even then one would expect the butt shelf to collapse	30
1	Even your username is pretty annoying.  Can we get some bots to filter this shit out please? Ban the fatties before they can post.	30
1	I think the "average" woman is also 162 lbs, so average isn't exactly not huge.	30
0	As a long-time fan of horror, I like to browse the creepy sub and I mentioned that [this post](http://imgur.com/cxEkp1O) should come with a warning for anyone who might claustrophobic.  Why? Because it's something that might genuinely trigger someone who has a very real phobia!	30
0	Yeah but I can only get verified after commenting for a week straight. Which I haven't done yet. I took the pic with my username and then I wanted to message the mods but I read the requirements first and I don't meet them yet.	30
1	Diet and exercise are better than free! You actually save money by just putting the goddamn fork down and not eating so much! It's a miracle!	30
1	Seriously? That's utter bullshit.	30
0	I've been going to a gym for 4-5 days a week for 18 years straight. Sit down and shut the fuck up, little man.	30
0	Not at all. Trp uses biology as the basis for a mating strategy. One of the big factors is to get in ahape.	30
0	Not really middle of nowhere, though. I'm not that rural lol. But most of the way isn't exactly city either.	30
1	I think the left one is senior year, the picture looks like a senior picture. The right one looks older. Not that she looks any different.	30
0	You sound like you've got some serious problems to work out. I hope you can one day get a place in your life where you don't have to measure yourself against strangers in the street. Laters.	30
1	Awesome! The M&amp;M one could almost be captioned with my username, ha.	30
1	Husky, at least when I was growing up in the 70's and 80's was always clothing manufacturers code for "your kid is fat"	30
1	No no no no no no no no no no noooooooooo  How is that real? How? Someone will have to clean that up, you worthless piece of leaking shit.	30
1	Hold up what? I'm not sure I wanna know. But, what?	30
0	&gt; I guess you've never heard of grammar or "animal cruelty"  You're a bit of a lazy ass hypocrite.  In the same goddamn thread no less.  Also, it seems like your laziness extends into pet ownership as well, as it's squarely your fault you let your cat out and it never came home.  And yet, here you are, trying to rationalize your shittiness  to a stranger on the internet by somehow arguing that I condone killing animals, rather than accepting the fact that your wandering stray cat is a fucking liability.	30
0	If hating fat people is the name of the game, wouldn't you guys be happy that someone is working toward losing weight?  Before anyone says it; No she didn't lose a whole ton of weight. But it's at least noticeable, probably 20 pounds or so. And who even knows how long of a span that was, could be less than a month.  So that leads us to making fun of people for not losing weight fast enough?	30
0	&gt; good for him  This is not progresspics or loseit.	30
1	People like this are everywhere. I don't see a reason to point out you are from the south.	30
0	what retard capitalizes vs.?	30
0	Please. It's a funny picture, but America still has the best looking women by far.  For every hamplanet you show me from America, I'll show you some dentist-deprived, mangled-mouth European.	30
0	How is that clear?	30
1	This pic is pretty much /r/GuessThatGender gold.  He could pass for one of Judy Freespirit's radfem lesbiham colleagues.	30
1	Well, it's got a pretty large canvas to work on.	30
0	I thought 0 was the baseline and anything above was plus 2 and so on	30
0	I just checked my bag of white rice and it's actually 640 calories/cup	30
1	10k calories??? That sounds like a workout in itself	30
1	Shit talking someone who is violent as a way to make his living...	30
1	To see shitlords uniting against a common foe.... The feels.	30
1	Second thought,  *"Curwen was also ordered to pay £200 costs and an £80 victim surcharge and was banned from owning or keeping animals for 10 years"*  Holy fuck. She isn't fit to own an animal for 10 years, and she has 3 kids at age 24? What the fuck kind of logic is that. She should have her kids removed and the government should mandate she ties her tubes so she can't pump out more little animal abusing fatties.	30
1	No, "moderation" is the group of assholes that ban the righteous social justice workers from FatPeopleHate.  Death to moderation! Death to the wretched hive of scum and villainy! Death to the thins!	30
0	Its sad for the chick at the lower left because she has potential to be so so very attractive (that face!) but instead chooses obeast-ity. Smh.	30
1	She took a year off to expand her fupa	30
1	"I'm fat and proud"  translation  "I'm lazy and gave up on improving my health and physical form. Deal with it."	30
0	Now just imagine if he wasn't famous..	30
0	Gross.  Can anybody translate the text?	30
1	...and mentally, 12.	30
0	That poor expensive car.	30
0	I think half this community genuinely hates fat people, ones who deserve it. Then I think the other half that posts nasty shit like this loves fat people. It's like internalized homophobia, so internalized fat phobia?	30
1	Let me save you the read:  More Fat: 18 msgs, 74 likes, 81 visits.   Less Fat: 36 msgs, 211 likes, 210 visits.  The author concludes that 18 messages is more than zero. So this is somehow a success for the fatter her.	30
1	I think you have hit on a common thread with hamplanets that is their inability to gauge dimensions. They are always (inaccurately) comparing themselves to much thinner celebrities or beloved public figures. They also seem to grade their own fatness incorrectly by saying shit like "at least I'm not as fat as Tess Munster" (for example). Hams simply cannot be trusted with any form of measurement whether it be meal portions or dress sizes they always get it way off.	30
0	&gt; She was Italian.  So she's fat AND has a mustache!?	30
0	Dude, lets be real here. They have probably been fat since they were kids. It isn't solely their fault.   You fucks need to get off your computer and read a damn book. You are pathetic.	30
1	But they're not real womyn! They're either photoshopped or have been oppressed into thinking that physical activity and appropriate calorie consumption is healthy. /s	30
1	Triggered so hard she skips arguing and goes right to violence. Tumblrinas can't handle real life.	30
0	I live in the most southern part of the US and I don't understand how people say Wal-Mart is full of fats. If anything, Wal-Mart has some of the finest girls I'd see in a day. Target has more of the fatties, but significantly less. Hell, there's barely any fat people here and the ones that are fat are mostly old people who lived a normal life then gave up when they got old.	30
0	It matters if your heart rate is increasing or not. That's the key here. You can go to a aerobic chart and see what your heart rate should be based on age.   If you are getting in the "fat burning" zone, you are in the good.	30
1	It boosts the confidence of people who are actually an XXXL but can fit into XL clothing due to the changed sizing.	30
1	Did you see what that burger was wearing? It was asking to be eaten.	30
0	There are some days I wish I was a flower petal.	30
1	http://seniorvoiceamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/obesity-early-death.jpg  I found this one too	30
1	Yeah, he is a super shitlord now. Love his stuff	30
1	Diet and exercise free? Must be a scam! Now we're the diet pills you skinny bitches keep hiding from us Curvy girls to shame us! :P	30
0	Welcome to reality, where 69% of all adults in the USA are overweight or obese.	30
0	&gt; sausage and egg McMuffins  That was the only thing I still got from there until they raised the price to over $4 for one.  Now McDs is dead to me.  Kids still get nuggets once in a while, but I don't eat anything from there anymore.	30
1	Any double digit dress size is a plus size in my opinion. 10 and up? You're plus sized.	30
1	I once (foolishly) tried to get a ham to go to the gym. Went something like this:  "I can't do (exercise) because have bad knees!" "Oh! Ok. What's wrong with them? We can work around it." "I don't know, they're just bad." "Have you seen a doctor and gotten a diagnosis?" "No. But my whole family has bad knees. They're bad."  The family was a full-blown whale pod.	30
0	The irony here is that this cat would likely have gone on to sadistically kill innumerable birds, reptiles, and small mammals. Nobody going to go to court for that.  Just saying: it's obviously not the fact that something dies in this story that pisses Reddit off so much. That dog saved lives.  Obeast is still sick for laughing.	30
1	Fat people ruin my rock hard cock.	30
1	Dirtiest bulk of all time.	30
0	Lots of fatties have in their heads that eating healthy food is the only way to lose weight, so they eat it. And eat it. And keep on eating it. Instead of eating less, they just eat the same amount in healthy food. It's a really bizarre way of thinking.	30
0	Well I take a meal replacement protein in strawberry shortcake flavour but find shakes dont ever fill me up, so i usually mix it with 30g of oats or 150g of low fat yoghurt to create a really filling snack	30
1	I've never been more proud to be part of a subreddit before.  Fuck you fat ass butter beasts	30
0	I use myfitnesspal ap to track my calories. Idk what it would recommend for you but it has been working for.me and my wife....	30

0	Most of them aren't 'fat' to be honest. Sure their BMI is obese, but fuck, they're not round balls like some of the planets I've seen. They're practically skinny in comparison	30
0	To be fair, from what we've seen of OP it isn't a stretch to assume she's a whore. He could just be a prospective client.	30
0	Funny this chart says I'm almost obese, but I've got abs. It's just muscle from weight lifting and strength training.	30
0	Oh my...I don't even want to imagine how they did it...	30
0	Op is a fa- oh wait in this case that's offensive.	30
1	I'm going to have to stop you there.  For some of us, those 'African Crones' with their leathery, spaniels ears tits were the first glimpse of a ladies rude bits,  1984, School Library, Row H, Blue Encyclopaedia, Vol XI, Page 277.	30

1	Those nose rings are supposed to go through the septum of domestic cattle, which is totally appropriate in this instance.	30
0	Holy fuck,  only one person in this shit sub has 2 brain cells that recognize trolling.   Edit: I'm doubling down. To have so much hatred in your heart that you belong to a community dedicated to open disdain for your fellow man, you aren't likely to be a good human being. So yeah, I think you are all pathetic, as pathetic as the HAES crowd you criticize	30
0	Anyone else feel bad for the apartment and the weight it has to bare? Don't even get me started on that poor toilet.	30

1	I'm not going to have any health insurance when I retire because fuckwads like this will drain Social Security dry with their 10,000 per month medical bills just to keep them fucking breathing on that scooter.	30

1	that first one is a 90% match.  you should give her a call.  i bet she would be able to keep up with you as you train!	30
0	they are all so fat... and hideous	30
0	"Does not instantly mean they're fat."  I agree.  That's why I asked a question instead of assuming.  Asking if someone is fat is not the same as calling someone fat.  I notice you're not verified.  Are you fat?	30

1	&gt;your friend looks like overcooked bacon.   So fucking accurate. 😂	30
0	That's not what I'm arguing at all. No, I didn't see any size 12 models, because they'd not be models. And my two 5'11 size 12 and 14 friends are fat. "Small fats", but fat.  We're arguing past each other, and we're hitting different things. You're agitated and misunderstanding me and seem to be taking offense where none is meant, so for the sake of ruffled feathers, I'll leave the issue be.   Ugh, not that it matters, but seriously. Some of those pictures can't be US size 12s. There's just no realistic way.	30

0	&gt; Because this is a common attribute of NYC apartments.  For the record, I also grew up in Manhattan. I know what a bathroom looks like. You're wrong. Here's a lawsuit the Attorney General filed against a [major developer in Manhattan over non-ADA compliant bathrooms.](http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/03/18/us_attorney_sues_related_over_inaccessible_apartments.php)	30
0	I spent 12+ hours a day on the computer because my job requires it. I've been losing weight without any issues for a few weeks.   Hams just like to ignore nutrition labels, eat at every opportunity and then pretend it's not their fault.	30
0	Have you ever thought that perhaps your aunt's preference in black men may be the cause, and not other races' lack of attraction? This is surface level racism and confirmation bias lol  I'm aware this is a joke, and it is funny, but let's not pretend we're all idiots and it's not a racist joke (which there is not much wrong with as long as you can recognize it *is* racism and that's why it's a funny taboo joke)	30
1	Just the top?  Just for a second, to see how it tastes?  Costco muffins don't have nutrition facts on them, but web sites report them at about 600-700 calories.  A McDonalds Big Mac is 530 calories.	30
0	I think they all have a lot of F.P. looking squishy...all of them...	30
0	And you post in /r/fatpeoplehate. Don't pretend to be superior to me.	30
0	Yeah go fuck yourself. Person is fat so why look at what they could be when you can look at what they are. Seeing potential in something that doesn't have anything is disgusting.  Banned for retardation.	30
1	Yup.  Right up there with the whole "If I'm too big for you, you don't have the equipment to handle me" thing.  Though I think that got jettisoned after people started replying with "Yeah, forklifts are a bitch to get certified for."	30
1	... *fecal* transplant? Does that... is that what I think it is?	30
0	xD i luv botdf!!!!111!!1!1!	30
0	This is rediculous. Americans today live to be offended, every little opinion you have someone will get butt hurt about.   I'd put money on it that if some fat dude tried to get in her pats she'd shoot him down without a second delay. But if it were a chizzled, pretty boy she'd jump him asap.	30

1	Benned for fat sympathy.	30
0	&gt;evading bans is generally frowned on by reddit admins  lol, I should give a fuck why? This site is the literally ground zero for internet circlejerking. I bet most of the men on here spank it to MLP and the women are so pent up they get anal fissures everytime someone mentions they don't give a fuck that they are a woman.	30
0	I just don't want people to be assholes for no reason. As you see from the comments I'm getting everyone here is clearly just a sad, bitter (probably self-hating) douchebags.	30
1	"Insult me all you want" Challenge accepted!	30
1	Why does it have a brown muzzle?  Edit: My wife says it's a mixture of Cheetos dust and makeup that is the wrong color.	30
0	Yeah... also all that hair on its forearm... oh goshhh	30
0	Definitely time it next time. If you run regularly then chances are it's not all that bad. I try to aim for 6 minute miles on my runs, and I don't even consider myself that much of a runner. I'm a much stronger cyclist than a runner (mainly because I don't enjoy running, so I do less running than riding), so I figure if I can do it, any decent runner could too.	30
0	If they do this they will no longer get the "arm exercises" of using high myspace angles and get even more fat.	30
0	fuck fat people but when are we at the point we we're just taking creepshots of fatties doing nothing	30
0	So... What's wrong with him? I can't be the only one who feels this is a bit of a fucked up thing to spit out at the open media. Maybe I'm not familiar enough with rappers.	30
0	Heterochromia is awesome, look at Mila Kunis and David Bowie, but being fat fuck is fucking unacceptable. Get that fat sympathy the fuck out of here.	30
1	I want to be treated exactly the same as a skinny person. Except for the part where you weigh them at the start of every visit to check for sudden weight changes that could be indicative of serious health problems.	30

1	BRIAN ITS ALWAYS A FUCKING BRIAN. Or Ryan.	30
0	&gt; because the reddit admins love to bend over for the SJWs.  Are there good examples for this? (Because r/jailbait wouldn't be one.)  I don't need a text by you, just a link will suffice.	30
1	I mean, I personally find the before picture more attractive -- you can't get down on people for what they like.  But you'd be a fucking fool to claim that the after picture isn't a person who is stronger, more fit and leads a healthier lifestyle.  I guess the second picture reminds me of my sister who was a hardcore gymnast for 15 years.  The association turns me off.	30

0	How would that work though? You can only check in one ticket st the end and most airlines overbook their flights. So if you buy two tickets it doesn't change anything.	30

0	How do stretch marks even happen? when I started to work out I got a few somewhere on my shoulder close to my armpit but it's not really visible. Do you gain stretch marks at rapid weight gain or can it also accumulate over time? I'm pretty afraid to get more of those at places where they are actually visible from gaining muscles mostly because I have a friend that has some nasty stretch marks around the same areas as me but at more visible places	30
1	Boobs are fatty tissue, but when youre egg shaped, the only room the fat has to go is into your titties and turns them into truck mudflaps.	30

1	TIL Meninist is a Thing...	30
1	Same chick posted this same progress to r/xxfitness, got maybe 200 upvotes. Hours later a fatty fat fatass whines on and on about what "HAES means to her" and gets like 600 upvotes.  The fats have invaded and plagued fucking everywhere, even our fitness spaces.	30
0	Are these Baltimore Raven cheerleaders?	30
1	Because 60-70% of the developed world are selfish fat shits with no emotional intelligence.	30
0	Those stretch marks gross me out so fucking much	30
0	Even if they wanted to be PC they could've given a copout answer like murderers or rapists, but they're just too afraid of facing a truth they don't want to face.	30

1	Lol I'll toss it on my site tomorrow. Stating at $7 minus my shitlord coupon code.	30
1	Ugh, I used to work the Haunted Mansion. Our standard spiel is "two or three bodies per buggy please". So of course they'll try to stuff three of their hambodies in there, causing the ride to stop and everyone having to shuffle around.	30

1	The baby platypuses are freaking adorable but I still like mine better!	30
0	Interesting how a BF% of 30 is considered obese... Then you see 35% and it all makes sense	30
0	Then, because so many people are obeasts, they will change the qualification of what obese is. Temporarily numbers will drop and the world will continue its' downward spiral	30
1	So I don't want to be *that guy*, but no personal info right? Yet you just posted her DL number?   Of course, this ham went through the trouble of covering her address, and left her *license number and birth date* on for the internet to see. The fat has seeped into the brain...

1	These people are unbelievable.  If you don't want to buy the product DON'T BUY THE FUCKING PRODUCT. Sick of these goddamned gender studies buzz words "ableist, sexist, racist." Then blowing this up to incident homeless and mentally ill people. Sorry femicunts,  the homeless and mentally ill have real problems.  These FAT entitled pigs need to just die of their pending heart attacks already and be done with it.	30
1	Yeah, that's nonsense. If anything, big dicks don't count on fatties because half of it is buried under their Fantastic Under-appreciated Personality Attributes.	30
1	If it looks like a pig,  And it eats like a pig....    It's probably a "feminist"	30
1	I like how it **tried** to make a fitted corset like top, and absolutely failed, not just because she's a fat ass whale, but because he darts on her top and the angles are all wrong.  I just started sewing and my mock dress is better than this finished one.	30
1	I think it's a tarp.	30
0	&gt;We  Get verified, then say 'we'.   Edit:  Look at our subscriber count, geniuses. We're definitely thick with fatties at this point and as far as I'm concerned every unverified user is a fatty in disguise until they prove otherwise.	30
1	What kind of fat fuck thinks he can sit in a plastic chair and thinks it will hold his fat ass	30
0	Its a dude who runs marathons. He's just really picky	30
0	A beautiful beard is blossoming! How special for it!	30
0	You should read the edited version of my post.	30
1	It's ok OP, it's ok. Here, let [Dr. Hibbert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D6_msdM8rU) explain to you the 5 stages of grief, you're at the denial stage.	30
0	that's 100% her left hand	30
1	THIS. THIS IS WHY I HATE FAT PEOPLE.  It's even worse when this type of shit happens in Canada, because the bill is payed for by the taxpayers. When obese people require medical treatment, it offends me personally that *I* am financially responsible for it. I have a mortgage to pay and a kid to raise, I really don't want to have to pay for some fatass to get medical care when it's their own fault they need care in the first place. I wish fat people would just die instead of wasting my money and resources. It *really* makes me angry.	30
0	Yeah, I get what you're saying but cats are still at risk of being prey. Stray dogs and what have you. Bengals are also quite expensive, if you're gonna spend that much on a purebred cat you should probably protect the investment.	30
0	Evidence-based medicine is a form of medicine that aims to optimize decision-making by emphasizing the use of evidence from well designed and conducted research. HAES is in no way, shape or form, evidence-based medicine. There is no well designed research demonstrating that obesity is safe and compatible with a healthy lifestyle.	30
1	"Uhhh yeah..I'll take a large cottage cheese ass...one - no - *two* flabby bellies...ummmmmmmm tsk tsk tsk aaaafour chins and a large DIET soda. I'm watching my calories"	30
0	Oh, come on. That is just a large woman in *every* sense of the word! She looks super tall, broad shoulders, etc. And she is actually **working**, not sitting at home collecting disability because of "diabeetus". We have bigger, lazier targets...	30
1	Write "feed her" on a fit woman's picture, no one bats an eye.  Write "starve her" on a fat woman's picture and everyone loses their minds.	30
0	thin priveledge is being recognizable by face recognition software	30
0	That's a pretty pathetic thing to brag about.	30
1	It's amazing how the delusion is so thorough.  These are undoubtedly the same whales who screech about how they look so "hot/cute/sexy" while modeling their cottage cheese-filled trashbag legs.  And then they turn around and try to act like OP's lovely slender legs are some hideous adipose monstrosity.  Why haven't we classified fat as a mental illness yet?	30
1	Landwhale heaven would be a Walmart that has a Starbucks, a McDonald's, and scooty lanes in the store. Heaven for them and a perfect hell for us.	30
1	She's shredded... or is it melted?	30
1	Yeah... I'm pretty funny ;)  And drunk  And I hate fatties	30
0	Now, now, there's no reason to use that language.    Sure they posted a series of images instead of linking directly to the article, but OP's not a *cunt.*  He's a *faggot.*	30
1	Because lying is the best way to start a new relationship.	30
0	Yeah, but she doesn't.  Banned.	30
0	Oh god I cracked up.  I'm going to use that for so many things. Thank you.	30
0	this girl doesn't really look that fat to me dude. i mean maybe she could lose like 5lbs?	30
1	I'd say both of them honestly. Natural, proportionate humans.	30
0	Lard ass yes but that beard game on point.	30
1	These things don't even look human. They look like those Vogon things from Hitchhiker's.	30
0	Thank you for fixing it. As said on the other comment I have never used reddit before and didn't know which link to use	30
1	Fatties still rubbed one out to those abs, I am sure. The cognitive dissonance must be crazy.	30
1	That travel agent is my SO	30
0	Higher than 25% is gross.  I hold my fellow ladies to high standards.  It's no longer curvy and looks like too many beers and doughnuts.  No excuse.  Edit:Looks like there are more 24.9 BMI women in here than I thought.	30
0	Scumbag fatties; Complain about being body shamed, mock people who are thin or fit.	30
0	http://www.acne.org/diet.html  4 studies to date with some serious flaws.	30

0	I would if I knew how Haha.	30
1	Hopefully the love towards our sub is growing and our message is spreading.	30
0	Found the butthurt fatty.	30
1	So now they need:  1. 6'+ in height 2. Funny/good personality 3. Larger-than average penis 4. Guy who can *handle curves*  Well, good luck with that fatties.	30
0	It's dat fat UNDER DA PUSSY! lmao. Upper brah but under da pussy is funny as shit too tho!	30
1	Oh no, no no. He finished that show because it was killing him and he got in shape. He was going to do another show which I think was a little more geared towards tasty AND healthier food. Some hams on twitter gave him a lot of shit for promoting health and he lashed out at one pretty bad, saying some very naughty words and things. As a tv personality he can't act like that without affecting ratings so they cancelled his show and I haven't heard from him since.	30
1	She's my older sister, 21 now. I'm only 17, I watched her grow my whole life, but would get yelled at if I called her fat	30
0	So, the person who complains about shitposts becomes a shitposter in this sub. Sound logic there fella, sound logic!	30
0	Hey man, we're here to make fun of the fats, not others.  Also, I notice you are a non-verified user making comments about a verified  not fat user.	30
0	Well considering that ALL food is organic, it's a pretty weak excuse. It's really not that hard to find out how much there's calories in the food you eat.	30
1	Jesus is fake. Just like your gym membership.	30
0	Feminism might be retarded, but it's certainly no excuse for being a fat fuck either.	30
1	What the fuck is that costume? She looks like a squidbilly	30
1	Congrats on getting better m8.	30
0	Damn, you are way bigger than your boyfriend	30
1	At risk of sounding like a conspiritard, I really don't think the U.S wants a fit or active population anyway outside of the military. Keep the citizens fat, docile, and stupid so there's no risk of anyone protesting or putting up a fight.  I kinda think this is what our government wants. And media just says anything as long as they get paid.	30
1	What are you talking about? Orange soda has fruit in it and it def doesn't make you fat, especially if you get DIET Orange soda.	30
1	Her chest fat is folding in half and obscuring her tattoo. HOW	30

0	I see posts like this, and I only think, Why are you giving these fatties the validation of a right swipe?   I couldn't let a fat girl think even for a second that someone else found her attractive.	30
1	We should organize an FPH census.  I didn't go full shitlord until I had two sons of my own and I realized how fucked they'd be if I didn't crack down and start teaching them that gluttony is a sin.  I'm in my early 30's and I also own my own basement, which contains my own private home gym, which I use to be not fat.	30
0	Is that thing African?	30
1	Your logic is sound. #HATRS!	30
1	You can dismiss a patient from a practice but it's a pain in the ass, you have to give them written notice and sufficient warning.	30
0	She does look better in the left pic though	30
0	Haha lmao. What you need to understand is that anyone unverified who talks about his own body in a post will be accused of being a hambeast. Getting verified is the best thing you can do to avoid future problems. Too many secret fatties around these parts. Especially if you're going to post more great things like the one before.	30
1	I tried to educate people about the reproductive strategies of ducks. 🐣	30
1	Looks like she's finally burning some calories	30
1	"I perceived it as" ah so in other words you made shit up to feel like a victim.	30
1	I'd love to see an instance on a tv show where someone like Dr.Cox from Scrubs or Dr.House received one of these. Pretty sure they'd tear them apart and stuff it down their fat holes.	30
0	Looks like bigger, larger version of Donald Trump.	30

0	I actually have "starved" in lieu of eating McDonalds.  We were on a road trip and the ONLY thing available at this stop was a McD's.  We kept driving another 2 hours before we got to eat lunch.  Thank god for granola bars.  Edit: starve in this context is hyperbole to make a point in the story.	30
1	She and thanks :)	30
1	Time to get verified.	30
0	Then discuss it somewhere else. From the amount of downvotes your post is getting, I don't think people here really want to talk about it.	30
1	Yep and it has been suspended	30
1	Is tinder for just hooking up or is it something like Match? Either way, if your greatest asset is your tits, chances are you're probably an idiot and believe everything at face value. gtfo and read a book ffs.	30
0	I'm not your buddy, pal. But seriously idk why I'm getting downvoted. Look in the post histories of the account. It has made 4 accounts just to get them banned in the sub. The thing appears to be saying it really is 410 pounds and is doing reverse satire where it attempts to make fun of our satire in some weird ass backwards way. Just goes to show how much the IQ suffers from the burden of McGrease flowing through its brain. Edit: it literally has been banned 3 times this thread alone	30
1	Roger that.  This piercing on appropriately sized female = sexah.  This piercing on a Jumbo-sizer = Legit rooting prevention.	30
1	Fat sympathy? Mods?	30
0	I remember that too and her boyfriend was just like getting so frustrated with her. I hope her baby isn't born fat, she's setting it up for a bad life straight from the womb	30
1	Man, that is one punchable face.	30
0	Haha I don't doubt it. I mean, I've had fine pizza in other states, it just isn't so widely available.	30
1	What "successful" model posts about needing a mattress? Can't she just go, get herself one and shut the hell up?   Oh right, she's an attention addict, immobile, lazy bitch.	30
0	She was going to say, "young" but then she saw the donut and "yum" came out instead. Tattoo artists aren't mind readers, so that's what she got.	30
0	In what universe is ONE McDonald's burger a day cutting back?	30
1	Those people are called humans.	30
1	It's a troll account. This is the internet.	30
1	Slightly? He went from "probably not criminal, just gross" to "criminally psychotic narcissist with the serious potential for stalking and sex-crime" in one sentence. I'd say that's more than *slightly*.  Otherwise, though, I agree with you.	30
0	Bet you a million dollars that's not even his bike, he's just enough of an asshole to get this lard sweat all over someone else's bike	30
1	I love my septum... But am sad that so many of these hams have them...	30
0	&gt; Jew here  I almost banned you for that.	30
0	He looks like a douche and that bitch looks like a rough trick that been around a hell of a lot.	30
1	Not a terribly surprising path for these people. They don't believe in calories in / calories out, so why not order wacko pills from India?	30
0	Also, it's a hat that's not meant to be worn casually. You're a pretty big tool if you wear a fedora with a t-shirt and you're fashion oblivious if you wear one that doesn't match your attire, OR if you wear one and you have round face. It's like wearing a single-vented jacket when you have a big butt.	30
1	Because they're unhealthy I'd wager.	30
1	My Subaru couldn't even handle all those curves.	30
0	Good luck finding a woman with sub 10 body fat... The absolute top female bodybuilders are rarely below 10... Lol this is getting down voted?  Fucking skinnyfat losers	30
1	"You were gifted"   "Check your privilege"   "you didn't build that"	30
1	Lol someone came through here and downvoted everyone's comment and this post.  *okay*	30
1	Not a doctor but I can hazard a guess. Probably for his gut flora. We have a lot of helpful bacteria in our bowels that help digest food and fight infection. They need sustenance as well.   These bacteria are so important that if you have a lack of them, doctors can do a fecal transplant.	30
1	As a girl with small boobs and flat stomach, this makes me feel better	30
1	He's actually a fantastic trainer. That is, if your goal is to be able to consume 10,000 calories a day and give up on life. In that regard, yes he's incredible.	30
1	She was lucky to be born with such great bone structure, but she has worked hard for that body. And at that level of fitness, she probably does have a burger sometimes, just not six of them in one sitting. Rage.	30
0	looks like a fat terminator uh	30
1	i had an argument on Yik Yak recently about how unless you have a flat tummy you can call them big tits.  If you're tummy is fat, your body is fat, and your tits are fat.  Fat does not equal big, it equals fat.	30
1	I went to school with this girl for years... she was a grade below, but it was a small private school so i knew her pretty well. The kids in her class would always talk about how she smelled and how greasy her hair was. Anyone want some more to shitlord at let me know...	30
1	"This doesn't inspire me."  To fucking what?  If you need to look at pictures of fat women getting toned just so you have the "inspiration" to do something, you probably weren't going to do it in the first place.  Just fucking do it.  So you're uncomfortable a couple hours a day.  WHO FUCKING CARES, IT ADDS YEARS TO YOUR LIFE INSTEAD OF TAKING THEM AWAY!!!!!  Jesus fucking Christ it's too early for this shit.  I'm going back to bed.	30
1	Towie / the only way is Essex	30
1	Well, fucking stop!	30
0	I'm not asking about a second time or not. It's not even about this case in particular...  If i go to restaurant and make it clear that i don't want any peanuts in the food, and the restaurant tells me there are no peanuts, but then i find out there are infact peanuts (cause they almost killed me!), do i have any legal recourse?	30
1	I hate to be the dissenting voice here. I do statistical shape analysis (especially the head and face) and image processing, and although I'm remarkably hung over and know little about their algorithm here, it is likely skewed by two factors: the drastic makeup which would make identifying salient landmarks difficult, and Tessbeast would probably be a big (lol) outlier compared to their training set. That being said, she definitely fools the heuristic for age identification in my own brain, which probably fares better than this automated approach on average.	30
0	Wow! Obviously this was about fatty! /s	30
1	Those chairs can support a normal human even if one of the chair legs is missing   http://i.imgur.com/F9eaRvX.gif	30

1	I took the liberty of entering all that junk into MFP: http://imgur.com/xPSYdo3  Over 4,000 calories in one day. Good thing it's his cheat day ^tee^hee /s	30

1	That one cracked me up.   A crane used to lift 1-ton bags of stone and shit can't even lift this bag of lard, so they have to get another that can lift cars.   No worry though, it being that fat doesn't effect anybody else!!! /s   It'll eat itself to death soon, hopefully.	30
0	I'm at 5 months and have gained 3 lbs woot woot! (mostly due to loosing 10lbs during morning sickness) I'm not planing on gaining any more than what I should. So far all my friends/family have lost the weight in 3 months because they didn't gain more than what was expected and had no time to eat after the baby was born. Fat tub of lards who use this as a time to "eat for two" are disgusting. Pregnant woman should eat no more than an extra 100 calories and they should be veggies not junk food. Okay sorry rant over.	30
0	I don't shave my armpits regularly and no one would ever know in real life. I wear shirts with sleeves and never tank tops. When I have to wear a dress for a special occasion I will shave.   Hams like blue pit girl don't represent us normal people that don't publicly announce something as trivial as armpits.	30
0	I know, I've watched it before. He's not wrong. Dj'ing is basically pressing play and fading in a new song. But if a DJ sucks because they have no taste, crowd control or creativity, the dance floor will be dead. Sometimes people want high energy, sometimes they need to catch their breath. That is the art of DJ'ing. Pressing play is just a step in the process.	30

1	One on the right has some nice curve to her legs... Wonder what some silk stockings would do for her. YOWZA.  Anyway, hey Big Bird, move your fat ass!	30

0	YUM, the white ones are my fav, the powder ones are not that bad for your heart. . The choco donuts by tastykakes are delicious but worthy of a heart attack. Perfer tasty brand then the store brands. Little debbie/hostess tastes like crap now, I remember I had some packages reeking of "paint" smell! Never again.	30
0	Bend forward, how hard is that? That way it is also easier to get out as you got more space. Seriously, this is retarded	30
1	6'5" here, the birds eye view just makes them look even more round.	30
0	That guy looks like he could probably choose, though.	30
1	All this hatred for fat people. You're all just bullies, maybe she can't lose the weight did you ever think of that D:	30
0	ummm, whats your beef with Krillin?	30
1	Holy Shit. I didn't think that was possible.	30
0	I hardly see a fat cunts in Sweden, and Denmark, but in Finland you come across every now and then. Never been to Norway tho. But in America, she could be a model.	30
1	It's all about that easy, instant gratification.    In their pathetic, childish minds it's easier to spend hours doing makeup and posing in special ways to hide their fat (which they claim to be so proud of, still trying to figure that one out) than it is to eat less and move more.	30
1	Oprah is like old-school decadent aristocracy fat. She can buy/eat anything she wants whenever she wants. She'll just have her head cryogenically frozen when she dies and be reattached to a skinny body at a later date.	30
0	"I hope there won't come a day when all of us but a few are spectators. . ." - how prophetic!  It is so sad to see what the US used to be and what it is now.	30
1	Funny how the probability of any given individual wearing lace-up shoes is inversely proportional to how overweight they are compared to a normal human being. I guess when you've got a gut that huge, bending over &amp; compressing it long enough to tie a pair of shoes restricts their breathing to the point of passing out.	30

1	I'm gonna take a ride on the nope train now. I thought I'd seen it all, but this is a whole other level of disgusting.   I never thought I'd see the day when the watchpeopledie subreddit would actually seem an attractive alternative to these pictures.   Well played FPH, you win.	30

0	Hey! Second from the right! I'm keeping an eye on you. You're better than that!	30
1	It was the fried chicken's fault, it should have known not to be so delicious.	30
1	Funny how someone butthurt downvoted you for stating something so obviously true. Feminism as a label made sense when it was female gender that was oppressed. The situation has evolved into a much more complex picture since then and it's very much time to move on to egalitarianism.	30
1	I thought it was Starbeetus =/	30
0	Who said it was? The guy was just giving his opinion.	30

0	I realize this sub is FPH... but OP, by posting this, you physically are hurting me. God damn.	30
1	Pretty sure she is manipulating her food diary to stay under her goals. Would also explain the 55 kcal of exercise lol	30
1	&gt;Which do you think men prefer?  Uh....the one that looks like it takes care of itself? Why isn't this the natural preference for everyone?	30
1	Eating way more than 10000 calories a day for a very long period of time	30
0	why do you censor yourself?	30
1	That and the slurping sound of her licking the wrapper….ughhh	30
0	Yeah I don't get how people see this as being ripped, very far from it	30
0	Yeah, 117. Character limits are an unacceptable excuse anyway.	30
0	that's exactly how some people feel about black/poor people. Doesn't make it okay to mock them.	30
0	I see.  Thanks for showing me the door :)	30
1	Pilot here. I love those weight limit requirements. Somebody's fat could literally kill everyone.	30
1	There's a cap and gown in both photos	30
1	You just gave me yet another reason not to vote for Christie. Thank you.	30
1	"In stills false body image"  First of all it's *instills* you fucking lard. And second, how is a **real** unphotoshopped girl instilling anything false??	30
1	Should probably tag that as NSFW bud.	30
1	I hear you! Yet if we turned round and said, maybe I should eat some of yours I'm the asshole! My new response to being told I look to skinny is "only in comparison" they don't know how to respond to that and usually shut up	30
0	The moderators did remove the photo. Last nigHt. And someone else reposted it. If I could get my photobucket.com to work I'd post a photo link to what she looks like now she is FAR from ugly which is why the comments need to start. Everyone takes bad pictures. This just happens to be one. She used to smoke cigs and drink a lot of soda. Her teeth are not this bad anymore and she really is considered a beautiful woman.	30
0	Probably. D:  Strangely enough, even though I gave them a cup of food each twice a day, the black ball managed to be seemingly fat...I'm going to guess the neighbors were feeding him because the other one wasn't getting skinnier.	30
0	Actually one has a beautiful son and is a model. Thank though :)	30
0	I hope i dont get much hate for this but here it goes. I share the r/fatpeoplehate ideology, even though I'm 30 lbs over the ideal bmi scale.   I think I'm addicted to food, it dreads me that I may have to give up going out with friends and eating in our favorite joints to get healthier (which I definitely need).   Halp?	30
0	Never said it was exclusive to me. I bet a lot of people are turned off this sub by the hostility.  you could get an even bigger following if you appeal to that crowd. I'm not being selfish- If you *really* wanna help eliminate obesity, you'd branch out to everyone, not just your own same circle that already have got the message.	30
1	As a southerner I can guarantee you that there sadly are people this dumb/gross out there.	30
1	I never said the U.S. was the best, see you already have this attack attitude about you and you start putting words in my mouth similiar to how the hammies attack anything that disagrees with them. It's not a competition about who is best or what country is better. I am simply proud of my country and answering your question whether I would die or not for it. And if you really do roam all over the place what would you know about culture and loyalty? much less a country on the other side of the Atlantic?	30

0	Am I the only one who fucking despises fat/shitty cosplayers, they fucking ruin it for everyone else and make other people look fucking stupid	30
1	No shit! What about *my* daughter who has defined abdominal, bicep and quadricep muscles? One day I'll probably come home to tears of her being bullied for having a strong body.   Hell, it's already happening, she just doesn't see it for what it really is.	30

0	I never claimed to be thin, just thinner than I used to be, and having hourglass proportions that I never had before.  Yes, I have more to lose, I never said I was done losing weight.  I'm a size 10.  I wouldn't consider that a "whale", but thanks for showing how much expectation there is to be a size...what would you consider not a whale...0?  I'll get right on that just to for you. There's no pleasing you people, is there?	30

0	Isn't grindr for gays? Wow so he's a faggot and he's fat. Either or would make me want to kill myself.	30
0	Personally, I'd rather hang out with someone who is heavier and trying to better themselves than some skinny-ish hipster fuckwad who thinks a burning weed on fire next to their face is cool. At least I know that they are real and just not trying to deflect their own inadequacies onto someone else because of an inherent character flaw. They can lose weight, you fucks will still stink unless you stop.	30

1	I started out thinking the guy was just being PC for TV purposes but then he went full retard.  Outside of taking up other customers' spaces, fat people are a safety hazard.  That guy in the picture is so goddamn fat the drink cart couldn't even get through.  But sure, let's let him pay for one seat because we should all be nice to each other.	30
0	Just one more time, for fun?	30
0	id fuck the black guy, he's probably more feminine then that bovine with a moustache	30
0	You are right, he is wrong.  If you walk 1 mile in 20 minutes, you burn the same number of calories as someone who jogs it in 10 minutes.  But cycling five miles at say 20mph will burn way more calories than cycling five miles at 10mph. That's because at 20mph you are overcoming wind resistance whereas at 10mph you are hardly expending any effort.  So intense biking is a great workout.	30

1	But I'm so hungry all day long, patiently waiting for the next meal so I can eat a few lettuce leafs to calm down my hunger for 30 seconds before going back to starving (with my inferior gunetiks and cundishuns preventing starvashun mode from triggering) for the rest of the day.  I just wish I could be fat and eat greasy pizzaburgers at every meal and snack inbetween! And be able to hug someone's fupa!	30
1	My guess was 47.	30
0	It's actually more for us who are a size ten, go to the gym regularly and won't be any smaller. I used to be skinny, my genetics probably won't allow that again. I'm not fat but I also won't be comfortable in a bikini because of what people will say. This subreddit is the opposite extreme of what the huge women whining about being ' big boned' and gorging daily is. Body acceptance is about acceptance of all and allowing everyone to be comfortable in their skin - fat, pimply, wrinkled, and the like.	30
0	Out of curiosity, why do you guys care so much?  I'm getting so bored of these "fat people upset me because they're teaching people being fat is healthy" posts. I'm pretty sure anyone with a brain knows that being fat is unhealthy and if they don't, why do you care if they get fat and have health problems?  Do you think you're "fighting the good fight" or something? I just don't get why you'd put effort into this specific circlejerk.	30

0	Feminist checking in. People like the waste of space in the picture are not feminists. That have corrupted the meaning of the word, just as the person above mentioned their co-opting of "cute" and "curvy". A feminist believes men and women are equal, not that men should be demonized to boost up women. There are a lot of us who believe in equality for all genders, not denigrating one to serve another. These SJW hams just bellow the loudest and most frequently. And frankly, they HURT the very cause they claim to be supporting. It's disgusting.  Edit - deleted an unnecessary word	30

0	Good name? Although there are no medical records (which I understand can make this seem unbelievable) her biographer claims she had over 12 abortions.   She was married three times; Not very christian by their standards. Scandal involving Kennedy. Died at a young age with a family history of depression and known addiction to pills. Yea. Good name she had.  Edit: everyone mad I ruined yalls opinion of this slut? First paragraph is taken with a teaspoon of salt but the second paragraph is all fact. She is a horrible person for any woman to idolize. I even think she was fugly.	30

0	Let's hope the kid has a brain and knows better.	30

0	"My bet is this is American" nice battle racism with reductive ignorant stereotypes! Not all Americans are racist, there are racists everywhere it's unfair to assume someone is American because they are racist. America has done a lot for equality and for African Americans, we feed them educate them and do all we can to help them succeed. Our general population would be disgusted by the coal burner comments. There is significantly less racism in America than in most other places in the world. I know it's cool to hate America because we are rich and powerful but honestly you just sound ignorant.	30

1	All the time when someone points out that sex with obese people would be really disgusting and impractical, the retort is often "you just have a small dick!"  So this obeast now wants to disqualify some of her big-dicked suitors because she thinks their personality might not be pleasant enough.   Face the facts - anyone interested in exposing their dick to her is already a crazy fat fetishist.  She shouldn't be picky about personality, especially if she requires rare men with huge dicks to probe past her fat folds into her ladyparts.	30

Yeah, a lot of girls want that swole look, but plenty of good looking girls like a runner's body, if I'm saying that right. I said it already in this thread I prefer cardio fit vs lifter fit.

1	&gt; YOU CAN BE FAT AND BE ANOREXIC  No, you can't. If you have disordered eating habits while not underweight then you'd be diagnosed with EDNOS.

While we all know hamplanets lie when they say they barely eat anything, it's amazing and sickening/frightening how many calories you can consume in a day through liquids. Alcohol is another really good way to quickly clock up empty calories... Dancing them off is fun and easy for us normal people tho lol	30
1	Inspired by the fact I saw a chubster today at the gym in a tank top with the word sweat written across it. She didn't fucking sweat a drop, I ran for 40 minutes and in that time I saw her come in, follow her boyfriend around, struggle a couple laps around the 1/10 mi track, and lose the ability to suck  in her fucking gut with all that exertion.   All I wanted to do was slap her with a piece of cheese. Fat shit, the smoothie bar is at the door. Exit at the fucking gift shop.	30
0	All you can eat buffets are a fat institution, and you seem pretty wrapped up in getting into fat style food like pizza and chips.   And I've lived in England:all you can eat buffets over there are full of fat people just like all you can eat buffets the fat world over.	30

0	I think there are plenty of women for whom a BMI of 17 is pretty much fine - it all depends on how you do it.  Agreed though - if you start underweight, you should gain a little more; if you start overweight you should gain less or even lose.	30

1	They don't have the time because their spare time is spent eating. You and I go to the gym, make time for it, balance everything else we do in life.   Fat people just eat. That's their primary concern. What's for lunch, snack, lunch 2, dinner, snack, dinner 2.   They have the same 24 hours in a day we do.	30

1	Oh god, she was actually fucking beautiful before and now she's just a fat fuck	30
0	I guess when they  have their Eat-A-Thons their brains release endorphins. Therefore they consume and are happy. Food is a drug to them they can never get enough. Im pretty sure you ask a fatty about what foods are their favorite they will go into a high detailed description.	30

0	That's the thing though, chocolate is just the start. Everything that's not been officially approved or "key-holed" as we call it is going to increase significantly in price.

0	I'm speculating, but England is kind of infamous for being a nanny state. It's possible that she reported the fake accounts to FB (or people she know did) and at that point the state may be able to charge whoever owns that account, taking it out of the hands of the victim (same person in this case) to retract/cancel the charges.   You can find similar actions in domestic abuse cases, where if the state become involved charges are pressed even if the battered party doesn't want them to be.	30

1	Correction: they linger on the stairs and you can easily outwalk the smell.	30
0	i dont remember starbucks being that good? dunno	30
0	I mean technically it is a curve too. It's just possible to have too many curves.  Edit: Haha, never received so many downvotes before, but I ain't even mad. I thought I was being clearly anti-fat, though; it just kind of cracks me up when fat women talk about being curvy when, unlike the perfectly proportioned women in FA cartoons, they've all got way more "curves" than any normal woman.	30
1	Buttered bars sound amazing!!! Lol at hybrid butter. My local market has Amish homemade butter (fairly unusual for my part of the country, but I'm glad to have it). If I can't get that I go for good old kerrygold Irish grass fed butter- available at most grocery stores.	30
1	Nobody can be stupid enough to really believe being fat is healthier than being fit or a normal weight. That's the fatties lying to themselves.	30
0	This is /r/fatpeoplehate, not feminist hate. Take your redpill shit elsewhere.	30
0	Alright, but I'm still waiting for that verification	30
0	So eating way too much and hating on people is different than when they don't eat enough?  They can both be mental illnesses, but at the end up the day it IS easy to rectify.    Obeasts are in the same boat as anorexics in that their food intake has a huge correlation with their feelings.  I don't get how you can be on a sub that hate's fat people then defend the people doing the same thing but on the other side of the spectrum.	30
1	Humans aren't biologically wired to detect the actual age of other humans, they're wired to detect health, and thus closeness to death. What you're perceiving as premature ageing is their shortened lifespan.	30

1	I thought blood coagulated in the stomach making brown/black chunks as opposed to brown/black liquid.  Looks to me like he just ate too much before his match and suffered the consequences. I've been there after thinking "Yeah, two cups of black coffee is a suitable breakfast before mountain biking!"]  I could easily be wrong on both accounts though.	30
0	What is that really? You obviously can't tell health by a blood sample.	30

0	Holy fuck you guys are terrible. Yes, she is obviously in very poor health and needs to work harder to stay healthy. Can't you guys hate their lifestyle, not them? I just can't imagine what kind of issues someone needs to have to call someone(yes, even someone who has made bad decisions) an "it".   Of course now I am going to get called fat. Just ban me already.	30

1	I just wish there was some standard TED held them up to. A student club here runs Tedx and they sell out. Went to them twice and besides the unidan one, most were pretty good talks	30
0	This is actually an interesting question. If i go somewhere to eat and i request a change in the recipe, and they agree, but then don't deliver, do i have any legal recourse?  Some people have food allergies and can even die if the cook puts something in there that it wasnt suposed to...	30
1	I think the point was that she has no excuse.  One could argue that the average person has a number of obstacles to overcome to make those important healthy lifestyles changes, but Oprah has no excuse.  She has, like, negative excuses for being fat.  Ugh.  If I had her resources I would be like the queen of shitladies.  Fuck her.	30
1	Oh god that video was huge and I was not ready. Wow.	30

0	The right way to do it, is putthing them in a cardboard tube and setting the top on fire so the rodents eat their way out the other end. Instant weight loss. Thank you, Shitlord Romans.	30
1	I imagine this is what all Planet Fitness instructors look like.	30
1	That's true. So maybe shitlords just go cut the pizza line and board the place up. We can cheap out on materials not like they have any muscle left.	30
0	I can't find it. Reapproved.	30
0	That makes no sense. It's a healthy fat, look up the new studies. It's crucial in the production of certain hormones, with a minimum required amount.   Do have to say though, that food all sounds too good!	30
0	This sub makes some good points, but is largely ridiculous and silly. You're not infamous because you made a difference, or you matter. You're infamous because you're assholes. Whether you're right or wrong is another story altogether.	30
0	So the ruptured fat cells, and their content, is released into the body. I'm pretty sure that unhealthy and already severely over taxed organs of obeasts are going to get toxic from this. Especially since the easy way out is off label use, and moar injections all over. Coupled with extreme amounts of fat, they r gonna just up and die.  Body cannot absorb that much melted fat that fast. Unhealthy bodies even less ability.	30
0	I wonder what else would fit in the cups of that bra (if it can still be called that)...bowling ball? Watermelon? A newborn baby?	30
1	Wow, totally thought the title was paraphrasing her. Fucking nope.	30
0	What in the fuck?	30
0	Are.  Not is.	30
1	Upvoting everyone to combat the downvote fatties.  Also, that shitlord comment at the bottom "when do calories ever count for you lol" is sadly as harsh as they come on most facebook posts these days	30
1	Health at every size. Basically, they claim one's weight doesn't correlate with how healthy they are.	30

0	I did a google image search. What am I supposed to find, exactly?   Here's a little primer on [what happens at a wound site](https://thomasreynolds.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/inflammation.jpg).   It does not matter how clean the wound is, you have bacteria on your skin that live there naturally and your body will mount a defense. It is obvious that the 'girl' in the picture is not having a reaction to the supposed wounds. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that she wounded herself.	30
0	One of these things is not like the other	30
0	I like both of those things.  If you procrastinate your craft you are not an artist. I don't even get that title, and I spent well over a year drawing 8 hours a day every single day.  There again, it's obvious this ham is procrastinating. If it wasn't, then it wouldn't be so damn fat. Too busy with a tablet in the lap.	30
